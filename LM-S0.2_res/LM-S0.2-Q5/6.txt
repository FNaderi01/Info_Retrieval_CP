			Our Approach.  Our Commitment.  The Gallaudet Promise.		
					Gallaudet’s response to the pandemic has been led by the COVID-19 Leadership Team. This group includes the President’s Executive Team, campus public health and safety experts, and other key leaders in the campus community. Ensuring the health and safety of the Gallaudet community remains the university’s highest priority. all while continuing to deliver an unparalleled student experience and upholding Gallaudet’s commitment to academic excellence. Coordination with the District of Columbia.  Our plan addresses required actions and public health mandates of the District of Columbia. Gallaudet will continue to work with the D.C. Mayor’s office and the D.C. Office of Planning to support any required changes to the opening status of the university. Our plans are continuing to evolve, and we will communicate updates on a regular basis.     
			Our Eight Guiding Principles		
					We have identified eight principles to guide Gallaudet’s pandemic response and decision-making. These principles mirror the three imperatives of The Gallaudet Promise: Our 2020-2030 Vision: Bilingual Mission, Belonging and Equity, and Innovation for Impact. Anti-racist. Anti-audist. Free from Oppression.Our Guiding Principles also reinforce Gallaudet’s commitment to a campus that is anti-racist, anti-audist and free from oppression.
										Cherish each member of our community.
										Focus on your health, safety and well-being.
										Equitably meet each person’s needs.
										Commit to open communication for all.
										Promote language vibrancy and valuing our bilingual community.
										Value innovation, creativity and adaptability.
										Commit to academic continuity and accessibility.
										We are all in this together.
			Our Key Decisions for Fall 2020 		
					Gallaudet will largely remain in Phase One, which includes remote Instruction and work during the Fall 2020 semester
								Moving to Phase Two, a hybrid approach to remote and on-campus activities, will begin in designated operational areas of the university when it is safe to do so. Any on-campus activities will be limited to only on-campus students and/or employees, will generally include 10 people or less, and will adhere to D.C.’s current reopening plan as well as its guidance for colleges and universities.
					All on-campus health and safety procedures and protocols will meet or exceed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for college and universities.
								We will reflect other, evolving professional guidance. 
All individuals allowed on campus will be required to adhere to the following physical distance guidelines:
 	Maintain at least a distance of six (6) feet between individuals inside buildings and in all public spaces;
 	Avoid close contact with other people;
 	Use face coverings or face masks on campus any time a person is in the presence of others in public settings or where physical distancing is difficult to maintain (e.g., meeting rooms, laboratories, common indoor workspaces);
 	Remain at home, or in a residence hall room, if they have a fever or other symptoms associated with COVID-19; and
 	Operate at a maximum of 25% building capacity in office spaces in accordance with the District of Columbia’s Phase Two guidance.
					The university will deliver instruction remotely during the Fall 2020 semester.
								This decision was made after careful consideration of all possible models for safely and effectively delivering instruction during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Nearly all faculty met during the summer with the Faculty Online Training Team (FOTT) to: (1) become more effective and engaging in their remote instruction (with most becoming certified in online instruction); (2) design sign language-vibrant learning experiences for their students; (3) design learning experiences that are multicultural and trauma-informed; and (4) better use Gallaudet’s learning content platform to optimize connecting with students and monitoring student engagement and success. Students will engage in a similar online training program to prepare them to learn and engage remotely.
					All students will receive a 15% tuition discount.
								Recognizing both the loss of the on-campus experience for students and the impact the global pandemic may have had on many students and their families, Gallaudet has reduced its fall semester tuition by 15 percent for all full-time and part-time students.  This includes both U.S. and international students and students in the English Language Institute.
					The university is planning to have up to 100 students reside on campus this fall.
								Priority will be given to students who have no or unsafe housing situations and who need campus-based support for learning. We anticipate that the initial group will be 50 to 60 students. and we are planning for their arrival prior to the start of the semester, which begins August 31.
					International Students
								Gallaudet continues to uphold its longstanding commitment to support our international students -- who hail from 35 nations -- so that they may fully engage in our fall 2020 learning experiences. On July 14, the United States government announced that international students may stay in the U.S. for remote learning. This is a reversal of its July 6 statement that international students enrolled at U.S. colleges and universities offering courses 100 percent online must depart the country. (This decision was strongly opposed by many schools, including Gallaudet.) Gallaudet’s international students are free to take courses remotely, regardless of their place of residence. International students will receive a separate letter with helpful information to help them prepare for the Fall 2020 semester.
					Student Health Ambassadors for Health and Anti-racism
								Gallaudet plans to invite students to apply to be part of a small group who will serve as ambassadors to support both the university’s health and safety response to COVID-19 and its ongoing multi-faceted anti-racism commitment.  These students will first work virtually, and once conditions permit, will continue their work on campus.  They will serve a key role in creating a healthy, safe, and equitable campus environment and preparing additional students to return to campus when it is safe to do so in 2021. Students who return to campus during the Fall 2020 semester will also be learning remotely.
					Clerc Center, Gallaudet’s birth-to-21 program, includes the Kendall Demonstration Elementary School (KDES) and the Model Secondary School for the Deaf (MSSD).
								Both schools will begin with remote instruction, with the most likely scenario being they will remain fully online for the first semester, through mid-January 2021. The Clerc Center will plan to transition to a hybrid instructional model when sufficient health and safety measures are in place.
					Gallaudet will continue to monitor the local and national health context.
								The university will submit an amended reopening plan when it determines it can safely expand the number of students and/or employees on campus, shift to a hybrid instruction model that includes campus-based classes at the university, or the Clerc Center is prepared to shift to a hybrid or in-person instruction model, and resume on-campus living for MSSD students.
