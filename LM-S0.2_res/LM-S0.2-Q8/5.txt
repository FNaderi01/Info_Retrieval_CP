EdNext Podcast · Ep. 157 – April 3, 2019: EdNext Podcast: 2020 Presidential Candidates Press For Higher Teacher Pay
			Last week, Kamala Harris made headlines with an ambitious—and expensive—plan to raise teacher pay, and she’s not the only Democratic presidential candidate talking about education.
Marty West discusses what the candidates have been saying with Ira Stoll, EdNext’s managing editor, who has been reporting from the campaign trail in New Hampshire and who wrote “Teacher Pay Emerges as Democratic Primary Issue.”
The EdNext Podcast is available on Apple Podcasts, Google Play, Soundcloud, Stitcher and here every Wednesday.
