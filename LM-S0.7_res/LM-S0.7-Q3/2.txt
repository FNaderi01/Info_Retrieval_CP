                      The goal of the Human Development and Psychology (HDP) graduate program is to study the nature and course of human development, in context, to inform practices and policies that affect the welfare of children. Students learn about children’s cognitive, social, and emotional development in social contexts, including the home, school, day care programs, the playground, and communities. The program has served as a model for training in applied research and the application of research to real-life settings.
