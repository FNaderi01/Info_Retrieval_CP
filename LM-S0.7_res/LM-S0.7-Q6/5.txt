            We noted last month that high school students in Boston would get to sleep later next year, with most high schools starting at or after 8:00 am.
However, facing a great deal of opposition from parents, the Boston Public Schools later announced that they will not implement the changes.
Finley Edwards wrote on the effects of later school start times on student achievement in “Do Schools Begin Too Early?” in the Summer 2012 issue of Education Next.
