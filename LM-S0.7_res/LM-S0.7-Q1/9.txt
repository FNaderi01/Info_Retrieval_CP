            How does the public view California’s schools and education policy effectiveness? Do voters understand the challenges that California faces, and are they prepared to make the tough choices and tradeoffs that potential solutions entail? Annual polls conducted by PACE and the Rossier School of Education at the University of Southern California seek to learn more about how Californians perceive and understand the opportunities facing California’s education system, and to gauge voter interest in policy options that move the system forward.
For full data from each year of the PACE/USC Rossier Poll can be found in the Poll Archive.
