    Summary
      I couldn't get out of my head the Sanders Sides as characters in other fandoms.  This isn't a story!It's a bunch of lists of main characters from fandoms as Sanders Sides who would play that character's role in their universe. There are also quite a few AUs that aren't actually other fandoms and occasionally a scene to go with an AU.Example:Evan Hansen: Virgil (Anxiety)And I know there are warnings but nothing is graphic.

    Summary
      One boy, ten girls, wouldn't trade it for the world...The Loud family are thick as thieves, one could say. Sure they fight and bicker almost everyday, but they would never purposefully hurt one another. And with twenty missing kid cases going on in Royal Woods, they have to have each other's backs. But one day, the only son, Lincoln Loud, decides to go down there, thinking there might be a ghost he could catch. But of course, things get so much more complicated than that...Lincoln, now an anthropomorphic cat, now has to deal with not only his family's shock and his body and instincts, but also must face the very same thing who did this to him, a demon named Static, trying to manipulate him for his own revenge. It'll only go downhill from there...
