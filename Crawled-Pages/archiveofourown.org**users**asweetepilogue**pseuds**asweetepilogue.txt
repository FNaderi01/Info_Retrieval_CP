    Summary
      “You like Crowley very much, don’t you?” Adam asked him.Aziraphale’s smile widened a bit. He nodded, not bothering to answer with words. Outside, Crowley was describing all nine circles of hell to a daisy. “You love him.” Adam said, very certain of that.

    Summary
      “The Angel of the Eastern Gate.” Crawly grins. “What’s your name, anyway? You never said.”“Oh...” Apologies, Aziraphael almost says, but then he doesn’t. That would be taking things a bit too far, he thinks. This is still the Enemy. “Aziraphael.”“Aziraphael,” repeats Crawly—or tries to, because halfway through the word he chokes. Quite badly. Or: What if Aziraphale’s name was originally "Aziraphael", in keeping with the conventional spelling and pronunciation of angel names, but because of its divine nature, Crowley is physically unable to say it out loud.
