    Summary
      College doesn't seem like the place you would find a mafia at first glance, but it turns out to be the perfect cover. Blood chilling things occur on the small island run by an Italian mob. No one would even come to think a criminal psychology professor could be anything more than that. It certainly wouldn't cross anyone's mind what dark secrets professor Williams may be hiding. Not until one of the members of his gang makes a mistake that garners the interest of the FBI.Agent McGarrett is sent to find out the truth about the organized crime taking place on the island disguised as a college student. With many secrets hiding behind both of their masks, forbidden feelings bloom.
