 The Aftermath of the Las Vegas Shooting             
				By Kimberlee Buck, Staff Writer                
	                	                Published October 12, 2017

 After last week’s mass shooting massacre in Las Vegas, authorities have investigated whether or not the shooter, Stephen Paddock, could have committed this act alone. 
Recently, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Assistant Sheriff Todd Fasulo dispelled the rumor. 
“I want to emphasize we believe Paddock is solely responsible for this heinous act,” he said. “We are aware of the rumors outside of the media and also on social media, that there was more than one assailant. We have no information or evidence to support that theory or rumor. We believe there was only one shooter and that was Stephen Paddock.”  
        ADVERTISEMENT        
Since the news of Paddock’s suicide, survivors and people who lost their loved ones from the deadly shooting are looking for answers and for someone to be held accountable for the evening’s event. 
Earlier last week, all eyes were on the shooter’s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, 62, who was considered a person of interest. Danley had been living in Southern Nevada with Paddack, in a single-family home. When authorities arrived to the home to conduct a search, Danley was not there. Later, her whereabouts were announced, stating that she was in the Philippines.  
After being interviewed by FBI agents, Danley said she had no explanation for what motivated Paddock to act out the massacre. Danley went on to discuss how Paddock purchased a plane ticket for her so that she could visit her family in the Philippines. While there, he wired money to her, saying it was for her to buy a house for her and her family.  
Danley believed it was his attempt to break off their relationship but continued to decline any inclination that he was planning to carry out one of the deadliest mass shooting massacres in U.S. history. 
This undated photo provided by Eric Paddock shows his brother, Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock. On Sunday, Oct. 1, 2017, Stephen Paddock opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest Festival killing dozens and wounding hundreds. Authorities trying to piece together the final days before Stephen Paddock unleashed his arsenal of powerful firearms on country music fans on the Las Vegas Strip have at least one potential trove of information: his gambling habits. Gaming regulators say they’re sorting through documents that can include suspicious transaction or currency reports. (Courtesy of Eric Paddock via AP)
“I knew Stephen Paddock as a kind, caring, quiet man,” said Marilou Danley in a statement read by her attorney, Matt Lombard. “He never said anything to me or took any action that I was aware of that I understood in any way to be a warning that something horrible like this would happen.” 
Now that authorities have confirmed Danley is no longer considered a person of interest, a new theory has emerged identifying the gunman as having a severe mental illness that was likely undiagnosed.  
According to ABC News, Paddock who was financially successful, had a difficult time interacting with people and is described as “standoff-ish” and “disconnected.” 
FBI profilers and behavioral scientist have spent hours examining these claims by interviewing witnesses to better understand his motive. 
As FBI forensics experts and evidence technicians continue to examine items in hopes of finding new details, the City of Las Vegas dimmed its lights for 11 minutes as a tribute to the shooting victims and heroes.  
After the 11 minutes passed, digital marquees lit up with a new display reading, “When Things Get Dark, Las Vegas Shines.” Hundreds were in attendance for the vigil.

Organizations across the U.S. have launched Las Vegas relief efforts for those who were affected by the shooting. Local officials also set up a ‘Las Vegas Victims Fund’ through Go Fund Me, which can be accessed through www.gofundme.com/dr2ks2-las-vegas-victims-fund. As of press time, over $2 million was raised; all proceeds will go towards relief and financial support to the victims and families of the mass shooting.  
Participants who are interested in giving back and are Verizon wireless customers, can give through the National Compassion Fund by texting the word VEGAS to 20222 or by visiting www. nationalcompassionfund.org . Celebrities and sports teams similar to the NFL Oakland Raiders, who are scheduled to move to Las Vegas in 2020, donated $50,000.  
Aside from food, clothes, and financial donations, the City also needs blood. Las Vegas residents are highly encouraged to visit Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center to donate blood.  
Additional relief efforts can be found on the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army website.
