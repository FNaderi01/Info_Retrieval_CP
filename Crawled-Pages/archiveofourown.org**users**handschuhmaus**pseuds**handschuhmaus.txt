    Summary
      When Tahani hears that her little sister is getting married, from what seems like every news site on the planet, she knows what's coming. She knows the media's focus on her will start to shift to why she isn't married yet, and her reputation can't afford another hit after Cleveland.So she hatches a plan. Platonically marrying a man over twice your age is a good plan, right?(Funnily enough, it works out perfectly.)

    Summary
      A while back I went looking for a comprehensive list of Redwall foods, and I couldn't find one. So I decided to make one. This was, perhaps, a rather silly decision, but here is the result, and I hope the next poor silly creature looking for this information doesn't have to re-read all twenty-someodd Redwall books to get it.

    Summary
      “Are you implying that I am responsible for Voldemort’s actions?” Dumbledore’s voice had finally turned cold.“No, I’m saying you’re responsible for neglecting a young boy! You treated him with nothing but suspicion and coldness, and when he grew up suspicious and cold you took that as confirmation that you were always right about him.”“I assume you have a reason for laying these heavy charges at my feet,” said Dumbledore quietly.She sighed. “I just think… maybe you should take your own advice and try to solve this problem with love, not destruction. You don’t have to destroy a Horcrux.
