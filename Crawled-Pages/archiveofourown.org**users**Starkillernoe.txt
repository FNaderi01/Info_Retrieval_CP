    Summary
      In hindsight, this might just be the worst plan that Klaus has ever thought of, which is really, really saying something. But without Ben here. . . well if Ben were here, the plan wouldn’t even be needed. And, by this point, Klaus was desperate, and honestly what’s the worst that could happen? He can’t die, or rather does die, just doesn’t stay dead. So even if the plan fails, there should be no harm done. or Klaus misses Ben and makes a bad decision and Five deals with the aftermath
