            “Using NationBuilder, we were able to recruit new volunteers, make more GOTV phone calls than ever before... and, for the first time, send text reminders to urge people to get to the polls.”
          Amanda Melillo
          Deputy Director of Public Affairs of the NYCCFB
            "Having NationBuilder is key, because you just can’t track all your relationships and their complete histories in a spreadsheet. When you have multiple people working on a project, having one place where all of that information is kept up to date is really important.”
          Dahvi Wilson
          Vice President of Public Affairs
            "We picked NationBuilder because we wanted to be the tech-savvy campaign. We have a really interesting candidate... so our strategy was to get that message out there as many ways as we could in its purest form."
