    Summary
      (OC x OIKAWA)“I’m resigning from the Volleyball Club.” Yana Iwaizumi used to love playing volleyball, but not anymore. She joined a team  as soon as she was old enough to play competitively. Unfortunately, for better or for worse they were always in the top three strongest schools.After a sudden school transfer to Aoba Johsai she vowed to never have anything to do with the Volleyball Club or it's incredibly popular captain and main setter, Oikawa. That's a little hard to do, especially when your cousin is the vice captain of the team and Oikawa's best friend.

      Skull didn't want to start again, but he's glad he did. A new start allowed him to embrace his Metamorphmagus abilities, his political power, and make true friends. Also featuring confused magical Arcobaleno, because when a timeline collapses, wrapping your magic around your friends leads to hilarious results.

    Summary
      Sawada Setsuna was 17 and tired. At this point, all she wanted to do was go to college then hibernate for the rest of her life. Her father was practically a ghost, her brother a self-centered bully, and now worst of all was that a man in a suit had shown up and proclaimed himself an in-home tutor there to turn Ienari into the next Vongola boss.Yeah no, she wanted nothing to do with the mafia, thank you very much. Hasn't since she first learned about it from Hibari's uncle. But as always the Universe is hell-bent on ignoring her wishes, so what does she do? She rants. She has no idea how she got such a large following, but she's stuck with it now. A fic in which Fem! Tsuna is a blogger and vlogger who complains about the injustice about the mafia around her, her audience thinks she's a fantasy writer using modern mediums to tell her story, and the mafia infests her life like a parasitic plant you hate but can't help but grow fond of.

The arcobaleno did not know he was actually immortal, are freaking the fuck out, and confused as hell about why he's calling the master of death mummy. MOD!Harriet Potter is upset her son Teddy didn't visit while he was cursed, and disapproves of the people who were mean to her son. None of the arcobaleno were ready for this many revelations in under five minutes.

    Summary
      Most nights, Tsuna dreamed of Hell. It didn't matter that it had been years ago, or that Nana had taken him away from Karakura Town the very next day. The memories of blood, fire, bones, cages, molten lava, and thick, stinking smoke that burned his lungs with every breath hadn't faded even slightly.Reborn is expecting an idiot to train; an Iemitsu 2.0. Tsuna is nothing like he’s prepared for, and when the boy promises to burn Vongola to the ground if anyone tries to make him inherit, well, Reborn believes him. And that— that is a Problem.

    Summary
      The Straw Hats find out that their captain has one hell of a family. When asked about his mother’s whereabouts, Luffy simply grins and throws his arms out, gesturing to the endless expanse of sea around them. With complete sincerity, he replies, “The ocean is my mother!”
An AU where Luffy isn’t entirely human, and water affects him differently than other Devil Fruit users.

    Summary
      Skull was serving as a living battery for the world for long enough, but even her tolerance had limits, so when she died in the Future That Never Was she simply... refused to come back. Thanks to that she found her Territorry, her Family, her Freedom and maybe even her Equal.
