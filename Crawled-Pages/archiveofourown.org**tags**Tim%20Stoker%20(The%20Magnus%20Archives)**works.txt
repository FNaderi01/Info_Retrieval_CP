    Summary
      Martin Blackwood had finished his apprenticeship under Annabelle Cane and was, hopefully, ready to be a witch in his own right. He had just moved to idyllic Magnuston surrounded on all sides with forests and possible dangers and it was now his job to protect this town from everything else out there. Armed with herbal teas and a talent for knitting Martin felt at least somewhat prepared.What he wasn't prepared for was Jonathan Sims, the town's prickly librarian who seemed to know a lot more about the fairies then he'd expect and who Martin was hopelessly infatuated with. Things were getting complicated fast but Martin should be able to manage it all, especially with the help of his coven.Just remember, don't leave the path in forest and beware the Lords and Ladies.(Updates on Saturday)

    Summary
      I wanted to write a fic about what happened just after #92 Nothing besides remains.  Jon is pretty messed up by the end of this episode, his hand was recently burned, he gets tortured by Mike Crew, he get’s dragged out into the woods by Daisy were he witnesses Mike being killed and is nearly killed himself.  He has a cut on his throat and was made to dig a grave for Mike, which can’t have been great for his burned hand.  Then he has a really intense confrontation with Elias who confirms he is becoming an avatar.  So he must be in pretty rough shape all round.  Georgie later says he looks like the end of Die Hard.  I just want him to have some care and love.  And I made him get sick too because of who I am as a person...

    Summary
      Martin waved his hand in front of Jon’s face hesitantly, then snapped his fingers in an attempt to startle him. When neither of these seemed to cause any change, he stood back, frowning. What should he do? He didn’t think that he should just leave Jon like this, but at the same time, they did say waking people up from sleepwalking was bad, but this wasn’t sleepwalking, so—But he no longer had to worry, because with a gasp, Jon shot up into a seated position, eyes darting around wildly. “M—Martin?”////ORJon experiences sleep paralysis after falling asleep at his desk and Martin discovers him.

    Summary
      Welcome to the Magnus Institute, a creature feature where representatives from every Entity collaborate to preserve and investigate artefacts, examine public testimonials, conduct paranormal research, and yes, occasionally exterminate. There are our rapscallions we're fond of, such as that silly Distortion, always getting up to hijinks and light maiming. But then there are our liabilities, such as Nikola Orsinov and Jude Perry, who really could use some premeditated murder, which our team captain Basira Hussain is more than happy to arrange. We also must eliminate any and all manifestations of the Extinction, because we're trying to have a nice time here.
Feat. Head Archivist and Resident Vampire Jonathan Sims and his Archival Staff, Task Force Captain and Resident Phoenix Basira Hussain and her Squad, and Director Elias Bouchard, which we have no idea what the fuck he is but he sure is something. With special appearances from several departments to include Research speared by Peter Lukas, and our pool of consultants, to include our favourite podcaster and avatar of The End, Georgie Barker.
Step right in and mind the bloodshed and cassettes.

    Summary
      "Oh, shut up," the doppelganger said, crying and laughing. He looked like Martin, but that couldn't be right because Martin was watching this all unfold. "Now, I'm sorry to just pop in, but I have no clue how long I was in the halls - yes, I know you know - so I'm probably about to pass out. Sorry."
True to his word, he slumped down against the wall. Somewhere, a tape recorder clicked off.
"Alright," Tim said when the silence got uncomfortable, "We're not going to try and pretend that wasn't supernatural, right?"
(or, a time travel au, but this time with monster!Jon)

    Summary
  Martin could probably cut an intimidating figure in a pinch. Possibly. Maybe. To some.
  At least he was someone. Someone who wasn’t Jon, and could deal with—with the spiders, if there were any to be dealt with. That was probably the source of the nerves unspooling like magnetic tape to fill Jon’s stomach with buzzing static butterflies. 
  Yes, Martin was much bigger than a spider.
Jon really, really hates spiders. When a statement from an institute employee sends him spiraling into the center of a very complicated web, he's going to need some help to unravel himself, even if he can't trust his assistants to organize files. Even if he's starting to think the tugging he feels on his heart when he's near Martin Blackwood isn't actually heartburn. 
Martin, who is already head over heels for his grouchy new boss, doesn't love the idea of throwing himself into a dangerous supernatural investigation with so few clues and allies. But he likes it a lot better knowing that Jon's by his side.
