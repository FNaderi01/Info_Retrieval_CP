    Summary
      “Are you all right?” Simon mutters, reaching up and hesitantly brushing his fingers against Nathan’s shoulder where it rests on his chest.“All right?!” Nathan sits up suddenly, eyes wide. “I’m brilliant! You saved my life, Barry!” He grins ear to ear, and Simon exhales nervously with a small smile as Nathan laughs almost hysterically.
