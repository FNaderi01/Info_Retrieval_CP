As if the answer he seeks is hidden within the sweeping branches or between the twinkling lights. His body is here but his mind has wondered elsewhere. He is with the one he yearns for. The one who quiets his mind. Steals laughter from his lips. Nourishes his soul. Owns his heart.I put a gentle hand on his shoulder and squeeze. He looks up with a rueful smile. His eyes are raw. Glistening with unshed tears. He has nothing to hide.“Have ye called her?”“Nah.”“Do ye want to?”“Yes…no…yes…I dinnae ken. I need to. I want to…but I shouldn’t. Her life is her own now.”“Ye are no longer my wee bairn and ye ken yer own heart, but she is yours and ye are hers. ‘Tis clear as day to me.”“‘Tis no enough for her. No enough for us. I canna make her see reason.”“She’s afraid. Ye ken this. Yer lifestyle now and yer career, both of yer careers might be too much for anyone to handle, let alone someone who has a history of troubling relationships. She is strong lass who kens her mind. But sometimes her strength is her greatest enemy.”He looks at me with pleading eyes. The eyes of a boy who needs reassurance that his mother will make the world right again. “Tell me what to do, mam.”“I canna, mo mhac. Ye ken yer heart. Ye ken hers. Ye ken the answer.”She loves him something fierce. Of that I am certain. For I have lived that love and Jamie is the product of such transcendental experience. He cherishes her more than his own life. He glows with happiness in her company. Their souls sing to each other. She is his everything. That much is obvious to a mother. But will it be enough to sustain the trials and tribulations of a relationship that has played out in the public eye from the very beginning? For his sake as well as hers, I hope they find each other again. If not in this life, perhaps, in the next.

            One Quote, One Shot Book 2        This was a very interesting challenge! I thought I knew where I would probably go, what inspiration I would use, before I got my quote but once I got it everything changed. I never write in first person, I find it very difficult so my quote being in first person really forced me to think outside the box. It was fun to explore my ability to switch my mind from thinking in third person and I won’t deny I had to go back and change ‘her’ to ‘my’ a few times lol This One Quote, One Shot takes place in my Storyteller universe. If you’ve never read it that’s okay, it’s a collection of short stories so you don’t need to. If you want, you can read them after on Ao3. You’ll see my assigned quote in bold italics in the story below. Props to @notevenjokingfic and @balfeheughlywed for organizing! Enjoy!———-The first time I saw his face was in a dream. He was standing in a wood, tall and lean. Though surrounded by a sea of faces, he was staring up at the sky as though having a quiet conversation with the old Gods. I’d never seen him before that moment but he was familiar to me. After all, he had my husband’s eyes and though it was dark and hazy in the dream world, I was sure his hair was red. I knew we’d already met that dark night in the wood when he finally came into the world after a long, difficult labour. I was certain I was not going to make it through the pain; but finally, after 32 hours of labour and 45 minutes of pushing, he appeared just after the sun broke free of the horizon on a warm spring morning and was everything I had hoped for. Soft, red fuzz on his head and the same slanted blue eyes I’d seen gazing at the stars. He was a quiet baby for the most part, but his appetite was voracious. He suckled at my breast so hungrily that I first suspected he wasn’t getting enough but it soon became clear to me, from the firmness of his full belly and the milk smeared cheeks as he drifted off into a milk-drunk sleep that he was simply as anxious to grow as I was to keep him this small forever. I always knew he was special and I did everything I could to hold him close to me and protect him from the world. Others told me I needed to let him go, to not tie a boy so close to his mother as he aged lest he not be desirable to a wife someday. I knew what was out there though, what awaited him, so I told all the naysayers that until the day he told me himself that he didn’t need me, I would be there.Mothers and fathers aren’t meant to have favourite children but I don’t believe there’s a mother who doesn’t secretly have one deep down. It was assumed that as a mother to a daughter, I would have connected best with her but he was my favourite. On nights that I struggled to find sleep, I found solace in simply watching him. I would brush back the soft red curls that fell across his forehead and revel in the way the corner of his mouth lifted into the most lovely smile. As he grew older, he did begin to pull away from me, to start forging his own path through life, but he always returned. We would lay in the tall grass together on warm summer nights, looking at the stars I’d seen him appreciating in my dream all those years ago. While his father would teach him how to find his way in the dark using the night sky as a guide, I’d tell him the stories of the great philosophers and astronomers and about the atlas of the constellations. In the days before his 10th birthday, my husband reminded me that our sweet son needed to put away his childish notions of life. He needed to solve his own problems and not turn to me each time the world did him wrong. I wish I’d known then that I’d never have the opportunity to watch him grow into a man. That I would be gone from his life long before he first felt a tug on his heartstrings for a woman and even longer before he would hold his own children and grandchildren in his arms the same way I had held him. Had I known, I would have let him go sooner, in case it could in any way have softened the pain of my death. In the last moments of my life, I found myself back in the dream, staring at the red-haired man with my husband’s eyes, lit by the stars and the shine of the moon. The same people shuffled to and fro around him, smiling and laughing though I couldn’t hear their words. They stopped to give him their regards and he returned them with a nod but always found his way back to the constellations.As I moved toward him I realized he was speaking to a babe lying quietly in his arms. I had to strain to make out his voice, but beneath the fog of my dream I could hear him telling a tale of Orion the hunter, son of Poseidon. He shifted to rest, taking a seat upon a fallen log next to the fire and I followed, sitting down nearby and turned my gaze to the sky above. “These are the stories my Mam told me when I was but a wee lad,” he said softly to the baby in his arms. “Your great-grannie as it were. She would have loved you, Jeremiah. As I do.”I turned to face him, then, and smiled at him, across the body of the child. The night was dark and cold, alive with people all around but there was nothing where we sat but light and warmth - and each other.
