    Summary
      °°°this is a dark-ish, sarcasm filled story. Beware°°°Sick of Dumbles manipulations, Harry struck a deal with Voldemort after his resurrection ritual, which made his summer much more... interesting.See, everyone expected Harry to be a light, reckless, self-sacrificing Gryffindor and not a charming, cold and powerful Slytherin, who had a knack of getting under people's skin and wasn't afraid to curse those in his way. Nobody expected him to be ~dark.  Not even Tom (which - much to Harry's horror - helpfully pointed out that Harry was acting like a Tom Riddle 2.0, gathering followers and such)With Harry blatantly denying Dark Lord's return, they work together in destroying scheming Dumbledore and gaining followers, exploring their newfound bond and... sneaking into the Chamber to visit Basilisk?As Tom learns of Harry's past he realizes, everything he was told about his young nemesis was a lie. A carefully sculptured persona Harry created duped even Dumbledore. He finally met his equal.Not everything is at is seems.

    Summary
      After the age of thirteen a simple touch can mean the blossoming of a soul-mark and the beginning of an impossible to ignore relationship. Starting in the beginning of fourth year, Harry's life is about to get a lot crazier than he ever imagined. On top of the Triwizard Tournament Harry will have to tackle handling a soul-bond with the last person he ever expected to bond with. This series will loosely follow the books, becoming more divergent as we move forward.

    Summary
      Draco twisted it between his fingers... back and forth. The metal wasn’t particularly unique in appearance, it was actually rather plain. Yet, the piece had been discovered in the corpse of Hogwarts. Amongst the ruins of his former house, in the dungeons. It bore his family crest. Curious. No jewels adorning it, one of the many faceless minions brought it to him hoping for favor. Everyone recognized the Malfoy crest, feared it. He glanced briefly at the crumpled mass bleeding out on his floor, smirking. Favor indeed. He would need to refer to his father, ask what he knew. How had it been buried there? Who’s had it been? He sensed power pulsing. Curious. His mind wandered back to the blood and smoke of that final battle, the day the Dark Lord rose and conquered... the day hope died. The day many good men, women, and child soldiers fell... that Harry Potter was frozen within Amber... when Granger vanished. Most believed she was dead, but years later, Draco somehow knew she was alive and kicking somewhere. He’d keep orders current for her capture, to be brought directly to him. She’d be alone now... he almost pitied the survivors. His own guilt ate at him enough. The silver almost felt warm.

    Summary
      After the disaster at the Department of Mysteries, Albus Dumbledore wants to make sure that Voldemort has not placed any lasting enchantments on Harry while he possessed him. His inspection of Harry’s magic, however, reveals much more than expected: James Potter is not Harry Potter’s biological father. In order to keep this revelation secret for the moment, Harry is brought to Grimmauld Place with Remus Lupin as his guardian. Meanwhile, Draco Malfoy approaches Severus Snape in hopes to avoid being forced into Voldemort’s services. Seeing an opportunity, Severus decides to hide Draco and his mother with the help of the Order, thus landing them all at Grimmauld Place as well — much to Draco’s initial dismay.How is Harry going to deal with these news, his new housemates, and the revelations that are about to follow, while simultaneously confronted with the burdens of being declared the Chosen One and having to prepare for war?

    Summary
      The last time Auguste Nicolay saw his best friend Vega Lang, was at the latter's grandfather's funeral, when Auguste and Vega were nine years old. A few months later, a serial spree of arson destroyed many of the most ancient pureblood families in China, Vega's family being the first.At the beginning of Auguste's fifth year at Hogwarts, Vega and eight other Beauxbatons students spontaneously appear in the middle of the Great Hall, amidst blood, smoke, and ritual fire. Who attacked the french school? What political turmoil and new dark wizards and witches are making movements in France, in Europe, possibly globally?More importantly--to Auguste's mind, at least--where has Vega been these last six years? Does the genocide in China have anything to do with the attack on Beauxbatons?  *working title, may change at any time

    Summary
      A complete re-write of Book Seven:(mostly Hermione-centric, features other character POVs, and Harmony is the main pairing though this fic is about more than just their relationship it is a story about the war)‘So why are you still here?’ Harry asked Ron.‘Search me,’ said Ron.‘Go home then,’ said Harry.‘Yeah, maybe I will!’ shouted Ron, and he took several steps towards Harry, who did not back away...What could have happened between Harry and Hermione in the Deathly Hallows after Ron leaves. This story mostly follows canon but provides a different look at how the relationships in HP could have formed had Hermione realized that she and Ron did not fit well together and that Harry, her best friend, was really what she was looking for the whole time. Includes added subplots and a more realistic view on the war.[Updates on Sundays +/- a few days. Things are crazy right now but I’m still trying for weekly]**NOTE: this fic contains mature content, explicit language and is dark in nature. PLEASE READ THE TAGS**

    Summary
      Voldemort conquers wizarding Britain. Harry is allowed to live... but why? Attending a darker version of Hogwarts, he struggles with vengeful classmates, a strange connection to Dark Marks, and worst of all, Tom Riddle whispering inside his head. AU dystopia in which the Dark Lord discovers his human horcrux. Mostly gen, though praised for its gradual platonic intimacy between the two arch-enemies.One reviewer says of KYEC: I just found this story a couple of days ago, and I'm thoroughly gripped by it. I could barely stop reading in between chapters, but had to, of course, since your tale is already so deliciously long. The plot is thrilling and well thought-out, and your characterisations are spot-on.

    Summary
      Harry gets sick of his treatment at the Dursleys, and runs away to join a gang of street rats. On the streets, he quickly toughens up and learns that sometimes it's kill or be killed. He has found himself a new family to love - but also has more to lose than ever. He is plunged into a world of street fights, magical politics, and a world where a few words can destroy lives, build careers, or topple governments._____________    “Hm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Now this is an interesting case. You’ve had quite the life already, Mr Potter… ”Harry tried not to scowl.“Difficult,” continued the voice, oblivious to his discomfort. “Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s talent, my goodness yes - and a thirst to prove yourself. You certainly are an interesting case. I haven’t seen such potential to tip the scales in nearly fifty years… and in either direction, nonetheless. Not to mention… you’ve come in here with a very elaborate plan, Mr Potter. Lucky for you, Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that… well better be - SLYTHERIN!”
