        Has something scared you online?
        The Internet is great. But it can be a scary place and you can sometimes end up seeing things, you wish you hadn't.
          Often this stuff can just pop up without warning. If something online has upset, worried or scared you, don’t panic, there are things you can do.
           If you see something you don’t like, don’t click on it. If it pops up when you’re watching a video, close it down. If you are sent a nasty message or a challenge online, delete it.
          If you see upsetting content online, block the user it came from, and report them on the platform you are using. An adult can help if you’re not sure how to do this.
          This is how horrible challenges or messages are spread around. If what you’ve seen makes you feel worried or unhappy - don’t send it on to others.
          Make sure your device and privacy setting are correctly set up. Don’t accept friends you don’t know in real life, and never give out personal information such as your location.
          Challenge videos saying that bad stuff will happen if you don’t complete certain tasks, can be really scary. They are NOT real. Don’t take part. Even with ‘fun’ challenges that aren’t going to cause you harm – you don’t have to do them. Never feel like you have to do anything you don’t want to do.
          Talking through anything that’s distressing you with someone you trust, such as a teacher or a parent, can really help.
          If you’re worried about anything you’ve seen when using the internet or apps you can contact Childline 24 hours a day, online and over the phone on 0800 1111.
