                            Fanfiction - Something Beautiful (Ficlet III)
                            This ficlet is actually a missing moment, set immediately after the chapter “Law of Cooling” (YOU KNOW THE ONE 💀). It is slightly NSFW. Thank you for reading and supporting this story I so love sharing with you. XSomething Beautiful chapters, Ficlet I, Ficlet IISomething BeautifulFiclet III - HaikuYou find odd bits of yourself in the strangest places, pieces
scattered that you didn’t even know to look for, but that you receive with the
deepest gratitude and amazement. I found one of those pieces – the one he had been guarding for me all along,
which he had carved lovingly for over ten years to best fit the shape of me,
noticing and respecting my evolving edges as a woman – on the cool tiles of his
bathroom floor, with my haunches getting increasingly colder. It snapped into
place, somewhere on a hidden cranny of my breastbone, when my body still pulsed
with echoes of that remarkable man’s own creation.“Maybe we should get off this floor, Sassenach.” Jamie’s hoarse
voice whispered close to my ear, the curve of his bended knee impeccably fit
against the warm place where my popliteal artery thrummed.  “I think yer arse is baltic enough.”“You should know,” I snorted in amusement, nuzzling his shoulder.
His vibrant skin smelt of salt - sea-salt
and the one brokered from the waves of our lovemaking -, herbal soap and
faintly of a familiar scent, that I eventually recognized as my own with a
startle. “You haven’t taken your hands off of it for a bloody second. Don’t you
have the appropriate gauge of it by now, Duck?” I quirked a brow, the
strangeness (the newness) of his
hands and my derrière in close vicinity still striking, something that was
meant to be followed by a perfunctory pause.“You have an arse to write poems about.” He asserted dreamily,
gripping my naked buttocks in his palms with renewed intention, his fondness
evident by the way his arousal was growing further south of our entangled
bodies. “Maybe not sonets mind, but
definitely a couple of verses. Or better yet, a haiku - ”Round and perky,
the bahoochie full of wonders, shaped for my hands.”” I roared with laughter, our bodies trembling in close proximity from
my rampant guffaw. “Don’t let me smother your literary genius if the muse
speaks so strongly to you on the subject, but I’m pretty sure you’re absolutely mental.” I grinned and kissed
the small dimple on his chin, using a little teeth to create some extra va-va-voom.
“I gather that you’re an arse man,
then.” Noticing his slightly befuddled gaze, I caressed the well-made planes of
his abdomen with a daring hand and explained my point patiently. “You know,
when men were created, they were divided into two main categories – the arse-posse and the tities-squad. I’m thinking you’re probably an enthusiastic
representative of the first group, with a lifelong membership card and all?”He gave me a smug lopsided smile, managing
to infuse just enough tenderness to liquify my abdominal cavity in an instant,
the appreciation in his eyes like a new indoor sun (it shone just for me). “Hmmm, fair enough, but I think I’m more of
a Claire-man, to be perfectly
honest.” His parted lips traced my cheekbone, exquisitely slowly. “I like all of ye, Claire.”Adso peeked through the bathroom door with
a faint inquisitive meow, as if wondering about the well-being of the two
foolhardy humans laying idly on the floor (his concern driven more by his meal
schedule than out of true alarm for our bodily integrity, I was sure).
Realizing our attention was otherwise occupied with some pressing endeavours,
he trotted out to search for a warm nap nest, sparing us one last judgemental feline
glance.Undoubtedly feeling his own hindquarters
uncomfortably nippy, Jamie raised from the floor with a grunt, the movement
eliciting a harsh tenderness in his joints and muscles from all the night’s
exertions (pre and post-rescue). I
couldn’t take my eyes away from his chiselled naked body, stark in the silvery
first light of day, filtered by the grey clouds still looming threateningly
over Aberdeen. He bent down and wrapped his arms around me, transporting me to
the couch, where he carefully deposited me before he scooted next to me,
throwing a soft quilt over our exposed frames.“So,” Jamie
hawked, his smooth voice sounding unusually hesitant, as if he was
simultaneously eager and fearful of uttering the next few words. “Did ye - ye ken - like it wi’ me?”I slightly turned my head to better look at him, my cheek pressed
against the gentle curve of his clavicle. His eyes were fathomless, an indigo
precipice that promised me an insurmountable and delirious fall, without the
bone crushing impact awaiting at the bottom. “Do you want to know if I enjoyed having sex with you, is that it?”“That’s a verra crass and blunt way to put it, but - aye.” I marvelled at the possibility of
inspecting the flush appearing on his cheeks close enough to actually feel his
heat, the song of his vulnerable blood.
He looked very much discombobulated and painstakingly uncertain. “I kent ye
were…pleased. I know well enough
the look on yer face when something strikes yer fancy, Sassenach, be it a warm
blueberry scone or the feel of my mouth upon ye. But there’s more to it than
just a fleeting moment of pleasure, aye?”I hummed in agreement, breathless as to the point of almost choking
with lust for him, memories of incredible pleasure flooding my brain - so close
to the surface and still so corporeal, I felt like I could summon and relive
them at once. “It was very nice,
Jamie.”“Good.” He caressed my wrist, his fingertips lingering on the bony
slope as if he was preparing a dangerous climb over my marrow, and I could tell
the subject wasn’t entirely finished yet. “And by “verra nice” ye mean…?”I propped myself up on an elbow to better glare at his face, marked
with a light smile and a hint of cautious defiance. “Do you really want me to
grade your sexual prowess, Duck?”Jamie rolled his eyes and lightly smacked me on the generous flesh
of my bum, as he kissed (open-mouthed and
ravenous) the hollow of my neck. “Christ Sassenach, not grade, but maybe ye could elaborate a
bit more than “nice”, aye?” He
protested, offering me a narrow look, and continued between his teeth. “And
they say men aren’t in touch with their
feelings, mallaichte bàs!”I bit my bottom lip, distractedly playing with the moist auburn
curls at his nape. I had never really mastered the art of transforming complex
emotions into coherent and spontaneous words; out of the two of us, Jamie had
always been the most emotionally intelligent and the one able to compose his
heart into a single, all-encompassing, sentence (his soul tightly framed into the space between commas, his affection
blossoming in a well-pronounced vowel). Throughout our friendship, he had
learned to listen carefully to puzzle my meaningful silences and looks, without
the need for me to speak them aloud. But maybe as my lover there were still a
few things he needed me to say on
occasion, in order to make them true
- and for him, I would try.“It was different from every other time, with every other man.” I
shared gingerly, brushing the inside of his thigh with the nail of my thumb,
not in teasing but out of absolute need for the realness of him, for the parts
of him that were now mine to grasp.
“It felt like being known and still loved - it felt like you knew me
and still chose me.  When you moved in me, there wasn’t a part of
me you weren’t loving - that you weren’t arousing.” I coyly raised my eyes to
catch his awed and triumphant expression. “So, yeah, maybe “mindblowing” instead
of “nice” would be more descriptive,
Duck.”Wordlessly, Jamie’s mouth captured mine, a deep and unhurried kiss
that brought our bodies into further closeness. He teased my nipple with his skilful
fingers and I moaned nonsensical promises into his ear, palming his straining
cock until he whimpered under my efforts and cursed huskily.Soon enough we twisted from a lazy and slumbering position into
something more feral and possessive, my hips half straddling him as our tongues
clashed with abandon. “What about you?”
I gasped against his swollen lips, rolling my hips in one punishing motion that
created delicious crescendo-friction between us. “Was it like you thought it
would be?”He took a moment to answer, brushing stubborn brown curls away from
my shoulders, patiently gliding his hands down my breasts. “I fantasized about
it often enough, mo nighean donn.
Sometimes - when I left ye home after dinner and ye were a bit taken with
drink; or when we went to the beach, wi’ yer beautiful skin turned golden and
the warmth of the sun about ye - I would think of tasting ye, of making ye come
with my name on yer lips.” Jamie’s index finger voyaged deliberately down my
spine, making me shiver uncontrollably, until he reached the starting point of
the swell of my buttocks. “How it would be to lie beside ye and know yer body
complicit with mine.” His eyes darkened and he delicately bit the sensitive
skin of the top of my left breast, a touch of dark desire, provoking a keening
noise from somewhere within me. “My imagination didna do justice to the wee
noises that ye make, though. I feel larger than life itself when I make ye
sound like that.”“I’m sorry it took me so long to know - to realize.” I whispered softly, placing my open hand above his
breastbone (his heart’s response steady,
unwavering). “We could have had years
together already. I should have kissed you that day, when you graduated
from the Coastguard academy; I should
have made love to you right by the door, amidst cardboxes with tupperwares and
highlighters when you found me the perfect house.” I swallowed hard, my voice
quivering. “I should have realized it was only perfect because you were just across the street. That
everything led back to you.”I felt his fingertips gently tilting my chin up, guiding me to look
up to him. There wasn’t a trace of regret or judgment in his eyes or in the
relaxed set of his mouth. “I might have answered differently then, but now - now, my Claire, I think that perhaps
everything was as it should have been. So we could be ready for this - for us. To cherish and recognize it for
what it is. Maybe it was all meant for you and me.” I meant to show him how inexplicably right I thought he was, with
the things my body could take away and offer him back. Agonizingly slowly, I
started to move on top of Jamie, even if we were still unjoined; everything was
a liquid fire, creaking at distance in call for us to combust, and the
slickness created made for an unrelenting dance. I liked to feel him that way,
to know him so unbearably close just on the outskirts of my body, the promised
togetherness that we could still somewhat control. We gasped and trembled,
breathing fast against each other’s necks.The splatter of heavy rain thundering on the windowsill, sudden and
powerful, made me slow down somewhat to gaze at the subdued storm. Plump
raindrops bounced and jumped on the polished beige stone of the open window,
invading the room uninvited. I hesitated, deciding if I should close it but
instantly regretting the notion of parting from Jamie (even for an inch, a
heartbeat, a quick turn of his handsome mouth).“Leave it.” Jamie commanded softly, his palms enfolding my hips with
purpose. “I’d like to make love to ye with the windows open.”
