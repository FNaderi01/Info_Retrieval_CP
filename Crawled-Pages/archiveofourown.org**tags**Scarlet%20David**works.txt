    Summary
      Oh oh oh, trouble troublemaker yeahThat's your middle name, oh oh ohI know you're no good but you're stuck in my brainAnd I wanna know, why does it feel so good but hurt so badWhoa, my mind keeps saying "Run as fast as you can"I say I'm done but then you pull me backWhoa, I swear you're giving me a heart attack, troublemaker---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I thought the lyrics from Troublemaker by Olly Murs fit this fic but other than that, I don't have a good summary but that will probably change as the fic goes on, anyway, the general idea is that Winter is Head of Security during the Vytal Tournament so heads over with Weiss in V1. In V2, she encounters Cinder, lost on campus, in the middle of a thunderstorm and takes her back to her on campus apartment where Cinder stays the night and it progresses from there. I have no idea where this is going to go but I wanted to give it a try so, yeah.

    Summary
      After his final confrontation with his twin brother for the Seventh Needle, Claus Ryuka is resurrected by the Dark Dragon into the world of bloody evolution known as Remnant, where he must locate and combine forces with someone named Ruby Rose and her allies as they wage war against the terrorist group known as the White Fang, the monstrous Creatures of Grimm, and the henchmen and pawns who directly serve the supposedly immortal witch behind the misfortune that was befallen the world as of late: Salem. And who knows? Maybe Claus' third lease on life will lead to something better than his previous two did...

    Summary
      "How are you going to undo the crimes you've done? The blood that stains your hands?"Adam had made many mistakes. Over his short life, he had taken lives, destroyed livelihoods, attacked indiscriminately. Yet he felt justified in it. Freedom for the Faunus was worth as many lives as it costed them. But one fated train heist costed him more than he was willing to give, and after leaving the White Fang behind, he would have to decide what his purpose in the world really was. Perhaps Beacon held the answer. Where he would find allies and new friends, he would also have to face the evil that secretly infected the world, and the evil that had infected him.The question he couldn't answer is: Does he have the strength to do it?Updates every Friday.

    Summary
      As a member of the White Fang, Jaune knows that his skillset is... pretty much nil. So he doesn't understand why Blake is sending him on these missions to persuade women to support the cause, nor does he get why she keeps referencing that he's a rabbit Faunus when she does. Still, if she believes in his ability, he's going to give it his all!

She just wanted it all to stop and have something go right. She hopes that while at Beacon, she can find a way to break her curse... or succumb to her darkest desires.

    Summary
      The last time Blake had checked, she hated Yang. Or. She should hate Yang. She was supposed to hate Yang. Everything would be easier if she hated Yang. But somehow, she found herself not hating Yang. It was… unsettling. The Beast had trapped her here with a promise. The Beast had taken her from her family, who she’d never see again. The Beast was keeping her locked in a rotting castle with only herself and talking furniture for company. The Beast didn’t know how to make crust for a pie and Blake found it /charming/.

    Summary
      A drunken bounty hunter named Mercury Black has to pay his debts to Roman Torchwick before a wedding. This wouldn't be much of a problem if he knew where he was going. He thought he wouldn't make it, that was till something or someone sticked their hand out to help. Thinking the deed was said and done, Mercury planned to thank his saviour and leave, than he finds himself unable to leave. Seems his saviour turned out to be a mythological hybrid who is really clingy. He will have to get used to having a Dragonlady as a girlfriend. He better have some flame proof oil for this.

    Summary
      They say that "time heals all wounds", but some wounds are cut deeper than others, some would take a life time to heal, and most don't have the patience for that. When a forgotten figure from Raven's past reappears seeking revenge, will her daughter and her friends come to her aid, or will the woman who left so many behind be left alone herself? And is revenge his only goal, or will his emergence bring the kingdoms of Remnant to their knees?

    Summary
      Blake Belladonna hasn’t had the best of luck when it comes to relationships, and that’s just putting it mildly. Working at her best friend’s bar is just one of the stable things that’s going on in her life. But one-night changes everything when she meets Yang Xiao Long, current undefeated UFC champion. Things are going great between them, until the very demon from her past comes back to haunt her.
