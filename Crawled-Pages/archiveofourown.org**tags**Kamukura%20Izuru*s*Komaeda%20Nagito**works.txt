    Summary
      Hinata Hajime was your average business man. By average I mean, average. Average job, average life, average looks... but what he doesn't know is that he's going to have one hell of a ride which will turn his average life, upside down.Or a fanfic where everyone repeatedly tortures my man, Hajime, until he doesn’t give a damn anymore.

    Summary
      A lot of time passed after everyone woke up from coma and settled down on the island. Hajime Hinata finally found a way to safely restore Chiaki Nanami’s AI. What happens when the cast of DR2 returns into an upgraded Neo World program to bring back Chiaki Nanami? Izuru Kamukura and Hajime are separated entities? There's two Komaedas? Is all of this on purpose or another error in the program? Welcome to Dangan Islands friendship stories. Parallel universe to Life on Real Jabberwock in some ways but do not need to read both to understand. Similar to double twins but technically not. Combination of island mode, post canon, original ideas to make the cast have fun and bond...maybe?

    Summary
      "A story of Hope that ends in Despair."...The build up to the Tragedy of Hope's Peak Academy and what lies in wait. What was mundane school life for the students of Hope's Peak, suddenly falls apart and unravels into horror.  Hope, Despair, and everything in between.  Since I recently binged everything danganronpa again I remembered how much I hated dr3. Here's my attempt at fixing it since every other fic about it isn't finished or isn't satisfying enough to me.(Updates every monday)

    Summary
      "Rin-chan…" His voice sent shivers down my spine, while his eyes became dark with what was akin to… desire. He ran a long, pale finger down my cheek and stopped at my neck, right above my pulse. "Give yourself to me." My eyes widened before a loud sound echoed in the room. The sharp noise of flesh against flesh as his head turned from the impact of my palm smacking his face.

    Summary
      Everyone needs a break, and there's nobody more excited for his than Hajime Hinata. However, there's a lot more waiting for him on the glistening beaches of Jabberwock Island than piña coladas. Actually, he's counting on that.But what he couldn't have guessed was how the breathtaking paradise could turn so cold behind the veil of sunshine and ocean spray. Catching feelings was the least of his problems when he didn't know who he was feeling for, or that he would only learn how dark the story is after he inserted himself into it.

    Summary
   They have a house in some old, small town. One built long before Future Foundation was created, but eventually taken, that had avoided the worst of despair. It’s a pretty thing. Old ivy leaves creeping up the sides, moss invading the roof. It’s near dreamy, reminding him of a time long since passed. 
    He wonders if they deserve it. If they should bother staying.  ==In which despair sizzles out slowly, and Servant is left scrambling for stability.

    Summary
      “I believe I was born for the sake of meeting you, and thus, had my pathetic life salvaged for the honor of serving you, Kamukura-sama,” he says, his lips curling around the gun as he forms the words, so close to being in his mouth. What vestiges of self-control Komaeda has are minute, and close to crumbling apart to dust that slips through Kamukura’s fingers. “What use is there to kill me, now, if not your own pleasure? We are fighting the same battle, aren’t we? Perhaps our ends are different, but we both work in the name of spreading despair, do we not?”
Komaeda Nagito falls in love with the only man who has ever beaten his luck, and he won't let him go so easily. Not without showing his devotion.

    Summary
      The everyday life of a prince is boring.
That is, until you find yourself face-to-face with the most beautiful person you'd ever seen, who coincidentally thinks the same of you.
It is not interesting simply because he has fallen in love, but rather because the person he'd fallen in love with was a man and he was already set to be married to a wicked woman he could never come to care about. 
Luckily--or unluckily--neither prince is one to give up that easily.
