    Creator Chose Not To Use Archive WarningsYukishiro AzumaWinter Troupe - Freeform Alcohol If you think it's a euphemism? IT IS. A3! Tarot Zine Character Study
    Summary
      “The Devil tarot represents the shadow of one’s self, sexuality, attachment and detachment, restriction, and releasing limiting beliefs. Reading tarot is an art I dabbled once as there’s so much to be taken from it whether you’re reading your own cards or having them read. For instance, one particular reading when I was in Florence--”“Arisu, you’re actually being noisy,” Hisoka jabbed.“Rude! Let me finish! Azuma-san is, ehem, a fine adult specimen who’s mysterious and deep. It’s a bit fitting, no?”“For me, sex appeal and enigmatic mystique remind me of devils. It…  wouldn't be too far off the mark, if it’s alright for me to say, Azuma-san,” added Tsumugi.Thinking on it could have been the alcohol talking, or Azuma was just feeling his age tonight.

    Summary
      When an actor gets burnout, it can get hard to jump back up. Still, maybe an examination of their inner selves (and their play) is what they need to pick themselves back up at least a little.
