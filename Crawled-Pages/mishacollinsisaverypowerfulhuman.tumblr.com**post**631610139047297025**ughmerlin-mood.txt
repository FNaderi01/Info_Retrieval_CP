The way that Cas literally just gets up and follows Dean after he basically just implied that they were about to have sex. Nooooo hesitation whatsoever. Js
                                                                        latter-alice

                                                                        rauko-is-a-free-elf
                                                                                    The thing that really makes it obvious to me that Cas misunderstood what was about to happen here is...Dean: [randomly talks about a gay couple, then] You are not gonna die a virgin. Not on my watchCas: [instantly gets up and follows][next scene]Cas: [does NOT want to be in the "den of iniquity," and is visibly distressed at the idea of sleeping with someone there]I mean...there is one obvious reason Castiel would go so fast from "I am so down let's do this" to "I am so not down please don't make me do this" and it's pretty gay...
                                                                        cyxnrose

                                                                        rauko-is-a-free-elf

I'm just gonna go ahead and blame this scene for all the times Cas doesn't act on Dean's flirting ever again...In 5x03...^this shitIn 5x18...Dean: Cas, not for nothing, but the last person who looked at me like that...I got laidCas: (internally) I have fallen for this before Cas: *scowls*
