                            Fanfiction - Something Beautiful (Ficlet V)
                            This ficlet is a much deserved belated birthday present to the ever lovely @missclairebelle​. I love you loads, K! A heartfelt thank you to @veryfaintveryhuman​, whose recent comment on the last chapter of SB moved me to write again in this universe (that is the great power of generosity). This ficlet takes place immediately after Jamie and Claire’s wedding (honeymoon ficlet, y’all!!) and I hope you enjoy it. Let me know if you have other requests! XSomething Beautiful Arc I, Something Beautiful Arc IIFiclet I, Ficlet II, Ficlet III, Ficlet IVSomething BeautifulFiclet V – Half a MoonAfter
nineteen hours of traveling in commercial airplanes - including three layovers
(Aberdeen – Glasgow – Amsterdam – Abu Dhabi – Malé) -, followed by a
bumpy, sweaty and slightly terrifying trip on a light aircraft (a matchbox
for flying humans) and speed boat, it was hardly surprising that Jamie and
I kissed chastely on the lips before collapsing on the enormous bed of our
Maldivian honeymoon suite. Exhaustion had a way of knocking out sexiness, and
we had two weeks to enjoy being naked together in the sultry air. But my
slumber must have recognized the lingering tension of my body and the
expectations created by being a newly-married woman – amidst chaotic dreams of
bland airplane meals, arguments on the baggage claim desk and the immensity of
crushing blue surrounding me, I fantasized of being woken by the mouth of my
husband upon me and arriving at the lavish breakfast well loved. Thus, it was
somewhat disappointing when I opened my eyes to discover the plush pillow next
to mine empty of my favourite red mane. A note scribbled in Jamie’s jumbled
penmanship read “Went for a morning jog. Meet me at the beach, Mrs. Fraser?”I turned the
note several times on my hand, perplexed, half-expecting to find a “Got you,
Sassenach – meet me in the shower!”, but upon uncovering nothing else had
to admit defeat and drag my mildly annoyed arse to put on a bathing suit. Critically
examining my reflection over my shoulder, clad in a shiraz-red trikini, I
decided it was probably enough to ensure little time in public and our swift
return to our water villa. Carrying my light
beach bag and my straw sun hat, I padded across the long walkway which
connected the secluded water villas to the shore, where the main activities of
the resort were located. Before too long, I was settled on a sun lounger, thoroughly
smeared with fragrant sunscreen, like a buttered pale chicken ready to roast. It was still
fairly early, and my head was filled with a jetlag haze that made everything
watery and somewhat strange, so I napped on and off under the balmy influence
of the Maldivian sun as I waited for Jamie to return. Soon it became too hot (a
trickle of sweat defying my bellybutton in a nagging race) and I ventured
into the absurdly clear waters, discovering they were a far cry from the briskness
of Aberdeen’s ocean, like a liquid soup enriched by colourful schools of reef fishes
and corals. Lounging on
my chair again to dry, I noticed a couple of indiscreet young women giggling openly
near the beach bar, as they threw inquisitive and lewd glances towards
something on the far left. It was without any great surprise (but a definite
hint of pride and possessiveness) that I turned my head to realize Jamie
was running towards us.

                            Fanfiction - Magnificent Strangers
                            When I posted the first
chapter of this story, I told you it would make you laugh and be moved and that
is still my ultimate hope. While this last chapter for me isn’t about death, but
about life and love, I’m still putting a trigger warning on it. You can even ask
me or a friend what happens beforehand and then decide for yourself. This story
was a profound labour of love and I’m grateful for everyone who gave some of it back. XPart I , Part II, Part III , Part IVMagnificent StrangersPart V – Bonny SmileWe
have three good months after that. Jamie
is placed on a clinical trial for a promising new drug and I try not to inspect
him too closely for signs of its efficiency. There is an unspoken agreement
between us, since that day in Doctor Grey’s office, that he’d rather be my
lover for a minute than my patient for years to come. We
go on a series of dates, sometimes packing strolling, dinner, movie, drinks,
dancing, wild sex and tender lovemaking in a sole night, as if we are trying to
condense an entire lifetime into a span of unknown duration, but much shorter
than what it should have been. Every
so often we don’t sleep but touch each other from dusk to dawn, savouring long,
unhurried, hours of mutual satisfaction. Jamie makes me hot-and-cold desserts
every other night, tastes them straight from my mouth. I live things with him I
thought I’d only ever write about for others. We
go to Rome for a long weekend, plan for Hogmanay with mates and explore the
Highlands together. Jamie is beautiful and lively, his mind and wit sharp, but
his disease eats the little things. It gnaws at him in the middle of the Spanish Steps, when he has to stop
halfway up because he is breathless; it bites him during the night, when he
awakes soaked in unnatural sweat; it chews his hope, when he is formally
discharged from SAS, and he realizes
he is more than likely never wearing his uniform again. I’m
deliriously happy and permanently afraid, the two linked like a blossoming
plant and its parasite. I measure time through the growth of my curls, every
inch a memory shared with Jamie.

Some
events press into our lives with such strength, they effectively cleave it into
two: the before and the after.A
war. A divorce. The birth of a first child. The invention of electricity. A
vicious car accident. Being kissed by James Fraser for three
consecutive days, with little interruption. Before kiss; after kiss - my deliciously punished lips the line separating the
two. If
snogging Jamie could be considered an Olympic sport, I would definitely be a
proud gold medallist and world-record holder. I would wake up at dawn and
relinquish even dark coffee for some dedicated training. The man was made to be
kissed and I was born to kiss him, two destinies converging in a
saliva-swapping encounter. Besides
kissing - and some exploratory fondling, mostly done on top of layers of
clothing - not much has happened.
Jamie respects me in an endearing and somewhat infuriating way, and I haven’t
mastered a way to tell him I want to be
respected a little less, or with far less clothes on. He has read my
fanfiction, so he knows I’m not averse to the fine art of sexing. He is taking
his sweet time and driving me insane. I
don’t want to be treated like I’m fragile. Even when I know I might be, just
a little. On
this No-Chemotherapy Wednesday, I’m
sitting on Jamie’s plush couch watching him play the saxophone. He is executing
a solo cover of Yellow, and I feel
like my insides are rapidly liquifying into a golden-coloured smoothie of love,
desire and awe. He is creating a kind of magnetic Coltrane alchemy; it’s
an almost voyeuristic experience to watch him bend over the instrument lovingly
and turn his breath into jazz. Jamie
learned to play the sax early in his adolescent years and became quite
accomplished, up until the time he relinquished it to pursue a career in
military service. I cooed in delight the first time I went to his house and noticed
the instrument’s case laying sadly on the corner of his living room. He
hadn’t played since his diagnosis, because he had no music left in him. But now
he plays for me almost every day. As
I watch him perform, I want to tell him I put on good black lingerie, inspected
my legs and armpits for any miscreant hairs and dabbed expensive perfume
between my breasts. The beautiful contradiction of strength and tenderness he
applies into his skilled fingers tightens everything inside me, until I’m taut
and desperate. He
finishes his rendition and I applaud him wholeheartedly, fascinated by the
glint of sweat on his handsome brow. He pulls me into his lap and kisses me
soundly. “Come
here, wee Viking.” He says hoarsely, still a little out of breath,
gripping my waist tightly. “Hmmm,
ye smell sae good today.”“Do
I?” I say innocently, brushing my lips against his on a tease. “Just
my usual herbal soap and maybe some residual curry from last night.”

Chemotherapy Tuesday, I feel
uncharacteristically hopeful, not necessarily in a cure for my illness, but in
a resolution for that debilitating feeling of disconnect. When you’re
diagnosed, it feels a bit like yielding a very sharp knife, cutting all the
tethers that anchor you to life, to a sense of self and to normalcy. For once,
life is calling me from that place, instead of looming death. When
I enter the room, he is already there, this time cradling his own tablet like an
infant’s head in his big palm. I wave in greeting and he smiles back
momentarily, but keeps reading, thoroughly enthralled. Pterodactyl (small, quirky and slightly unnerving)
comes to plug me in and I expect Jamie to initiate conversation, just as he did
the day before. His eyes are fixed on the screen, wide and still-lake blue, and
by the look on his face he might be reading The
Book of Revelation.I
try to distract myself by looking at the treatment room’s decoration - or lack thereof -, remarkably naked of
gimcrack and gewgaw, with a sole picture of a sunny field occupying the large
wall. I guess there’s no point in trying to make such a place more suitable for
the living; cancer ruins any attempt at proper feng shui. “No
chit-chat today, huh?” I tease after a while, hopelessly eager to be standing
in the sun of his smiling blue eyes yet again. “‘Tis
the most engrossing read, Sassenach.”
He nods gravely and smiles in a way that makes my solar plexus do a full spin,
his handsome face like a pinch in between ribs, straight into the frailty
amidst bone. A dark suspicion that he’s reading the complete works of LadyCurlyWig_1 creeps in, and I’m both
mortified and elated. I
purse my lips, decided to be the coolest
of cool, eyeing the drip of chemo as I tap my index finger against my thigh
rhythmically. My eyes keep seeking his face (the scar on his temple the size of my thumb’s nail, the patches of
blonde stubble on his jaw, the tiny mole on the back of his right ear) and
I notice the puzzled frown of his brows as soon as it dawns, the way his mouth
opens and closes in quick succession.“Your
cogs must be rusty,” I point sheepishly, playing with my earring. “I
can hear them turning from over here.” Continuar a ler

                            Some stories find us exactly at the right time. The story of Duck and Sassenach found me when I needed
it the most and brought to me the kind of rare joy I will cherish forever. There’s
a different kind of power in telling a light, happy, story, that I truly enjoyed
discovering. While this arc closes today, I’m not saying goodbye – I intend to
visit them again, more than likely through ficlets, and I count on you to tell
me what you’d like to read as well. Thank you to all who read, supported,
commented and championed Duck as he fought to be with the girl of his
dreams and to make her absurdly happy. All my love, Kal. XSomething Beautiful Arc I, Ficlet I, Ficlet II, Ficlet III, Ficlet IVPart I, Part II, Part III, Part IV, Part V, Part VI, Part VII, Part VIII, Part IXSomething Beautiful IIPart X – Husband (II)JamieThe Red String of Fate.On
the last month of my solo travels, I had found myself in Japan, searching for
the peace of raining cherry blossoms, quiet temples and ancient tales of
unbreakable honour. There, I was told about the legend of an invisible red
thread, tied around the little finger by the gods, which connects those who are
destined to be together, regardless of time, place and circumstance. It is said
the Red String of Fate may stretch or
tangle, but it will never break.After
that occasion, I had decided to return to Scotland. To Claire.I
had long before realized my love for her would
never break or be tamed, no matter how many mountains I stretched that
thread across or how many deep oceans I submerged it in. Our thread was long
and unyielding, thickened by years of familiarity, connecting me to her
irreversibly. Only
many years later, I would start to believe she might feel the pull of that
thread too, tugging her ever closer (that
I, alone, possessed the other end). I
don’t think I’ve ever loved her as much as I did that night, as I saw her
walking towards me on the beach near our house, surrounded by a cloak of
darkness and stars. Even if her stunning wedding dress seemed somewhat
mismatched with knee-high Wellington boots, a long black parka coat and a set
of colourful mittens and beanie, I’d never seen her more striking.As
I watched her, the pad of my thumb pressed the cold metal of the wedding band
against my flesh for the umpteenth time, anchoring me to its realness. The now visible end of my thread. “Hiding
out here, are you?” Claire accused me amicably, before she plopped down
unceremoniously next to me, well within the merciful influence of a bonfire.
The dress’ fabric billowed around her, like a fallen cloud laying in the sand
for one night’s rest. “The party is still going strong. Mrs. Graham was
forming a conga line just before I escaped to find you. Tipsy people are
sleeping and cavorting everywhere in the house.”I
grunted, somewhat desperately. “I’m exhausted. Shouldn’t they be as
well?” She
sighed, fished inside her large right pocket and produced my Voldemort Funko
Pop keychain, dangling from her index finger. “If I wave this around,
do you think it will drive the message home?”

MissingI
groan loudly in pleasure at the second bite of my chocolate croissant, when I
notice Jamie’s gaze, brimming with awe and blatant hilarity. “What?”
I ask, my mouth so full of flaky and buttery pastry dough, there’s no way I can
pretend I’m a proper lady, instead of a black-hole-meant-for-food-obliteration.“Does
yer raiding party come here much?” He asks with a grin that would put the Cheshire Cat to shame. “Ye eat like a Viking, lass.” Jamie takes a sip of his
black coffee, accompanied by a plain whole wheat toast; on my side of the
cafeteria table, a glass of orange juice, a cheese sandwich, a plate of fruit
and a croissant are in close collusion to make me very happy. “A damned starved
one at that.”“Nutrition
is very important when you’re battling cancer.” I retort primly, brushing away
incriminating crumbs from my demolishing mouth. I’ve obviously failed to
mention pain au chocolat isn’t
exactly the prime example in the antioxidant and vitamin-wealthy department. “I
need to keep my energy levels up there.” I raise my hand to show how high I
want to go (fairly high for my pocket
size existence) and he snorts. “Which
oncologist is assigned tae ye?” Jamie cleans his mouth with a white napkin and
I secretly conspire to grab it as a souvenir, because this man is uncannily
sexy in the simplest ways. “I have Doctor
Sunshine.”“Me
too!” I roll my eyes and smile at him, delighted that he uses her nickname as
well.Dottie
Grey is posh and collected, always dressed in hues of black, white and dégradés of dull, and there’s a legend
on the Infirmary’s halls that she was spotted smiling once, a gesture so bizarre that
inflicted the most cruel terror in the hearts of those who witnessed it. The
ironic moniker Doctor Sunshine is
passed down amongst her cancer patients like a prized baton. She seems
competent enough, so I’m more than happy to endure her colourless taste.“Is
she happy with how your treatment is going?” I ask quietly, knowing this can be
a delicate subject to many people around the ward, but also absurdly curious
about everything regarding the SAS agent in front of me. He shrugs and studies me intently, with those
military eyes that demand instant surrender. “I think she’s hopeful. I’m no’
ready to die just yet, Sassenach.” He nibbles the crust of his toast with an
intentionality that makes my toes curl, my belly clench (it is as if he animates me from the outside in, my own ventriloquist).
“I mean, I have lived a fairly good life so far – I’ve travelled, fucked,
laughed and let myself be moved more than most people ever will. I have grown
things with my own hands and levelled some as well. But there’s still something
important missing, I reckon.” His eyes soften and his voice turns into a
whisper, so much so I have to lean a bit towards him to listen. “A great love story.”

                            Fanfiction - Magnificent Strangers
                            This fic won’t be very
long – I estimate about five chapters. If everything works out as I intended,
you’ll both laugh and be moved by it. There’s a lot of reasons why this story
feels very close to my heart and I hope you enjoy it, as I share the first
chapter from my food-induced coma this holiday. Merry Christmas! 🎄Magnificent StrangersPart I - Third CycleThere
are places where you half-expect to meet the man of your dreams: a dim
nightclub, while you dance around each other in a sweaty courtship; a Christmas
party, showered with copious amounts of expensive booze; a holiday at an
adults-only resort in Barbados,
crawling with other slightly desperate single people; a trendy pub after work
hours, eyes clashing from different corners of the room.And
then there are places where you’d never expect to meet anyone significant, much
less the love of your life. The
crowded and solemn wake of a relative, who happens to be a prominent figure in
the community. A dentist appointment, bound to leave you with two less wisdom
teeth and a swollen face for three days. A midnight impromptu trip to a
convenience store to grab sanitary towels, because your period arrived
unexpectedly, when you didn’t even bother to put on actual clothes underneath
your trench coat.  Or
a chemotherapy session, in the middle of your third treatment cycle. Today
is Chemotherapy Monday. Mondays used
to be for blues that lasted until Thursday, fishy lasagna at the canteen and
drinks with the girls. Now, Chemotherapy
Mondays are pretty much like Chemotherapy
Tuesdays and only marginally worse than Chemotherapy
Fridays. Four
months ago, I was showering after a passable nooky (with my then
beau-of-three-and-a-half-months Frank Randall), when I noticed a lump on my
right breast. It would only take two weeks to be diagnosed with stage two
breast cancer. Frank,
self-important and chivalrous (at least in his own notion of himself), promised
me we would “weather the storm
together”. His resolution, shaky like a drunken man after three days
of sobriety, lasted (surprisingly) until the day I shaved my hair. He
took one good look at me, bald and grinning, shook his head and told me he
couldn’t do it anymore. “It’s not
the hair.” Frank mumbled, as he neatly stacked a few meagre
possessions he had been leaving in my apartment into his overnight bag. “It’s the way you are always making
tasteless jokes about it all - as if everything is nothing but a punchline
waiting to happen.”“Well, don’t let me deter you.” I
went into the kitchen and filled up a generous glass of water. “I’d scream and pluck my hair out like
a proper woman scorned - but, you know.” I pointed vaguely towards my
hairless scalp and sat silently on the couch until he left. I
couldn’t tell him that humour felt closer to being alive than tears. I couldn’t
put into words that making a joke was a form of control I relished on, when
control was slowly being taken away from me. I felt like a dandelion, one
strong blow away from being scattered.

                            Here it is, my lovies, the last chapter of Dark Shines Murder 1! I had an honest blast writing this fic and I feel that it’s maybe one of the stories that speaks the most about me as a writer, if I was ever to write original stuff. It had a bit of a convoluted start and maybe because of it I’m honestly proud of seeing it through. I hope you enjoy and meet me here down the road for more - and if by any chance that never comes, there’s plenty of freedom to imagine what’s next! Hugs and love XPart I, Part II , Part III , Part IV , Part V , Part VI , Part VII, Part VIII, Part IXDark ShinesPart X – The Demon“How
can I help ye, Agent Fraser?” Malva asked with a hint of sarcasm. The
interior of her house was cluttered, as if she inhabited an antique shop, and
bizarre-looking items lurked from several surfaces. “Weil,”
Jamie brushed his upper lip with his knuckle and took out his small notebook
from his pocket. “Ye can start by telling me all about the relationship
between the Alba Coven and Claire
Beauchamp.”She
snorted and her eyes brimmed with unamused coldness. “There is no
relationship, really. Beauchamp takes pride in being a solo practitioner, as
I’m sure she has told ye - probably right after ye fucked her, hm?”“But
it wasna meant to be that way, was it?” Jamie cocked a ruddy brow,
studying her intently. He noticed the way her gaze wondered distractedly to the
left, the soft flex of her middle and ring fingers. “I’ve been reading
about Julia Beauchamp, ye ken. A truly fascinating woman. Although, I’d guess
that she went by her family name - Moriston - in her early days?” The
dark-haired witch threw him a resentful, bitter, look. “Yes, yes, our late
High Priestess was magnetic. A force
to be reckoned with.”“I’m
fairly new to this world, Miss Christie, but I was under the impression such
titles were mostly inherited. Passed on through the matriarchal line, from mothers
to daughters.” He paused purposefully, watching her inconscient signs
of discomfort and ill-temper, letting her stew a little in her uncertainty and
anger. Angry people spilled themselves easily.

                            This is the first part of the last
chapter of Something Beautiful – it would be a beast for my standards, if I
posted it as one piece. I highly recommend listening to “She” by Elvis
Costello on repeat through this, because it’s quite perfect. I’ll save last
words for the final bit - but Jen, this one is for you. Something Beautiful Arc I, Ficlet I, Ficlet II, Ficlet III, Ficlet IVPart I, Part II, Part III, Part IV, Part V, Part VI, Part VII, Part VIIISomething Beautiful IIPart IX – Husband (I)On the eve of our wedding, I cut Jamie’s hair. We were alone at our house, finally finding a moment of precious
peace, since both our mothers had been appeased by all the completed
preparations, and retired for some much-needed rest before the big day  (“Must
look good for all the Insta stories I’ll be posting tomorrow”, my mum told
me before she happily sauntered towards my previous address - her current
kingdom -, her arm linked with Ellen’s).This time, I not only traced the small mole behind his ear with my
fingertips, but kissed it wholeheartedly, making him gasp (a shudder, the unspoken invitation of the tilt of his head). When I deemed myself content with my ministrations, he turned
quickly on the leather couch, pulling me from my advantageous position and
trapping my legs with his body with remarkable efficiency and finesse.
Wordlessly, he undid the belt of my robe and opened it languidly, as he gazed
into my eyes (a promise of dark desire,
of light through it). I wondered how many times he had stopped himself from
doing exactly that - ravishing me after I teased him mercilessly - over the
years of our friendship, which to him had been the longest courtship. His mouth was hot on my belly, and even hotter further down; I half-heartedly
protested that we should be keeping some form of celibacy as nuptial traditions
demanded, but his answer was to redouble his efforts and I said no more. We showered together, happiness coating our nakedness along with the
scent of soap (not citrus, nor floral,
but undoubtedly sweet), and afterwards we curled by the fire reading Sharp Objects together. When my phone rang, I jumped to get it
- I had been awaiting a call from my hairdresser to sort some last-minute details.
“Hello?” I smiled and nudged Jamie with my foot, as he
mockingly tried to bite my big toe over the edge of the book’s cover. “Ah,
Mister Jenkins, how are you? I wasn’t expecting a call from you today.” Mister Jenkins was the manager of our wedding venue, a
scrawny-looking Welshman that talked a storm. 
Usually his energy and optimism seemed endless, so as I heard the tone
of profound preoccupation and regret in his voice, my concern was immediate. An unexpected flood due to
last night’s storm, he informed, as my lips became
completely numb. The damage to the main
hall and equipment, as well as all the decorations, is too great, I heard
somewhere in the distance, the wedding
cannot take place tomorrow. My hand was shaking intensely as he said, I can rearrange things and should have
another opening for you in six months or so.Six months or so.
