    Summary
      There was a lot of things that Kurama hated. The Uchiha. The Fourth Hokage. Hiruzen Sarutobi... The list goes on. But Kurama, for the life of him - can't seem to hate his new Jinchuurki, he has only been with this boy for five years, and while he hates Konoha with a burning passion - he can't hate the child who's parents sealed him inside the boy. Mainly because this is all his fault. When Naruto is five, he is gutted by an Uchiha - Kurama makes a hasty attempt to save his host by taking charge of taking the form of Kushina's brother, an Uzumaki who grew up in Kiri while Kushina was sent to be sealed. Kurama doesn't know shit about how to raise a child - but if he doesn't want his Jinchuurki to die before he enters the academy, he'll have to do things himself.

    Summary
      “Apparently,” Naruto marveled, listening to something only he could hear, “we’re on a time limit.”Sakura bristled. “Why didn’t he tell us before?”“He probably only said it so we wouldn’t spend the rest of our lives just standing here doing nothing,” Sasuke reminded her.“He probably did,” Naruto agreed. Then, after a moment, he added, “We probably would, too.”“He’d get so bored,” Sakura rolled her eyes, lips pouting in mock pity.“He’d spend the whole time trying to make us miserable,” Naruto continued, as if anything could actually make them more miserable than they were now.Kyuubi could still try, though.Sasuke grimaced at that. “Let’s do it,” he decided hurriedly.
