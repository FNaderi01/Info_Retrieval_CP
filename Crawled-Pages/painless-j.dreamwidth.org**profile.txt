                Hello,I absolutely love harry/draco ferret fics and would be ever so chuffed if you wrote me one ♥ ♥ ♥&lt;=== this was parlophone hijacking my journal! Am leaving it here to remind me of human deviousness :)Here is something about our coexistence (in case you want to try).You can friend or unfriend me as you feel like without informing me or asking my permission. I don’t think of LJ in the terms of friendship (although some people on my friend-list are really my friends). It’s all about reading - whomever I find interesting or whose ponderings I believe to be entertaining for me. I friend and unfriend people only according to my current reading preferences. Here I'm solely interested in fandom, so I don't friend back the journals that contain much RL or lots of quizzes. On the whole, I don't friend back many people 'cos I also have RL and other interests so I can't spend all day long on reading flist, however enjoyable it might be.No posts are locked, it’s not my secret diary. Anyone can comment. I appreciate politeness ‘cos it helps us to not kill each other but I don’t require it; I prefer honesty. I express my thoughts here the way I like. I love slash. I often talk about fanfiction and sex. Many topics are NC-17. So if you are underage, better stay away for our mutual lack of problems.Also, English isn’t my native language and my grammar can hurt your sensitive soul. As you might notice, this is a fandom journal. I was monofandomous for a long time but then started foraying in non-HP fandoms. I suspect that their number and variety will only grow.Lord of the Rings FPF recs: slash, genPirates of the Carribean recsPet Shop of Horrors recsJeeves and Wooster recsMy favourite manga and yaoiAnime/manga fandoms: fanfiction recs (Petshop of Horrors, Eroica, Death Note)What I like and dislike in fanfictionAnd now for Harry Potter.My big project is making searches for and compiling long thematic lists of HP fanfiction:Lists are divided into sub-groups.Magical Beings arc:Werewolves in HP fictionRare magical beings in HP fictionThe Elf-Fic Directory, compiled by peacoquettish with some help of yours truly.Harry Potter Vampire Fic Master List, compiled by katfusionVeela fics, collected by iranaHarry or Draco as Veela and/or other magical creature, compiled by alicambs~Voldemort arc:Defeat Voldie 101Vodemort possesses somebody's body"Voldemort won" scenarioDark Lord Harry (Severus, Lucius, etc)~"Family life arc":Same-sex marriage in HP fiction: A through ISame-sex marriage in HP fiction: L through ZMPreg fiction (sorted alphabetically: A through G)MPreg fiction (sorted alphabetically: H through O)MPreg fiction (sorted alphabetically: P through Z)MPreg fiction, sorted by pregnant person.

Because, duh! It's impolite at best. I don't know whether they are updated regularly or not and which of them are. But in any case there are lots of fics on each of them. I don't include here the attempts of themed lists that didn't collect a lot of fics. All these lists have different structures, but usually the compilers explain their principles. If you're interested in doing something like this on your own, here is my How To Guide: Themed Lists.~~Pairing masterlists:Masterlist of Sirius/Draco fictionLockhart Slash Masterlist.The Rarest of the Rare (human/non-sentient being).~~I keep three on-going (no deadline) challenges: 1) Snape is straight; 2) SS/HP/DM challenge and 3) Snape pursues Harry. The full info (in case you want to take part) and the list of the fics written in response to them is here. Sheer delight, have a look!Masterlist of Rec Old Fic meme. Have a look; there are lots of old favourites recced by various people.~~As for somewhat official stuff, I'm one of the submissions mods at Walking The Plank (A SS/HP Archive)and co-mod, together with tarie, an HP rec community crack_broom.Once in a while I take requests and make Five recs on a requested theme. Here they are.My Harry Potter recs have movedPlease update your bookmarks!What you’ll find hereThese are my recs of HP fiction. I can’t possibly write reviews of all my favourite fics, so I’ll go through my HP folders and pick up everything I loved, liked, found interesting or amusing, and put it all here. And where I did write a rec, I’ll add it.I should say it at once that of course no, it’s not everything that I liked. For my regret, I often have to read things when I can’t bookmark them, so, most likely, I’ve lost and forgotten another couple of dozens of stories I did enjoy.Fics are sorted by pairing, then by length within a pairing group, and further within - in alphabetical order.Rec ’stars’ mean only the extent of my love; there are no fics I didn’t like here.## — love to bits# — like very much or consider very interesting[] — rather likeAU stands for Alternate Universe (also for Alternate Reality ‘cos people use these terms as often interchangeable); WIP means ‘Work in progress’.Once again, there’s NO fiction I didn’t like here or stories that didn’t work for me. Here, whether with # or not, are only fics I like picked up from several thousands of HP fics that I’ve read. I’m not joking, they were, indeed, that much.This list, naturally, reflects my personality and my preferences only. I don’t pretend to be objective.Consider yourself warned: there may be warnings in the fic-info here and may be not. I’m not particularly easy to squick; I read everything and anything, even the things I don’t usually like. I’ll add warnings when I remember but I’m not sure I always will remember. So here you can find: chan, character death and afterlife, rape and violence, BDSM, MPreg and weddings, bestiality and cross-dressing and incest, and many, many other things one can find squicky or disturbing.
