    Summary
      Ambulon had a half a day to "enjoy" the Afterspark, but he was lonely. So very lonely. Apparently when you ask the universe to send you "anyone to talk to," it really gives you anyone.Even the one mech you desperately want to avoid.But maybe good conversation can come from luck like that.

    Summary
      Ari Mendoza threw himself in front of a car to save the life of his best friend, Dante Quintana, not knowing that while Dante might survive, he wouldn't. In an alternate universe where Ari did not survive the accident, he finds himself in the Good Place among his neighbors Leo and Diego, his soulmate Ileana, Tahani the Architect, and her assistant Janet. But does he truly belong there, or is he reaping the rewards of a certain someone else who truly deserves to be in his place?OR: An A&amp;D/The Good Place crossover. Major The Good Place Season 4 spoilers. Knowledge about The Good Place is ideal but not necessary. Knowledge about Aristotle and Dante is necessary.  Dedicated to my friend lostintheverse, who watched The Good Place just to better understand this crazy idea I had; you're amazing and I love you forever.

Bittersweet Ending Discussions of death and grief Healing this is sad but i hope it's also comforting Mutual Pining sequel to before i go!!
    Summary
      at times in the past four years in the afterlife, he’s thought perhaps he had moved on from jeongguk. they’ve been apart for so long, and although he doesn’t age in death, four years is still four years. he’d seen less back then, known less. when he first arrived in the afterlife, he was distraught for months, not wanting to move from his bed, not wanting to speak with anyone as he mourned the loss of jeongguk. 
but it got easier, as grief always does. after four years, he’s no longer sad when he thinks of jeongguk, but grateful for the time they had together. foolishly, he thought that might have meant he wasn’t so in love anymore.
but sitting here, only feet from jeongguk again—yoongi realizes it could never be so easy.
(or: four years after his death, yoongi comes back to jeongguk. a sequel to +before i go.)

    Major Character DeathAkechi Goro/Persona 5 Protagonist Akechi Goro/Kurusu AkiraAkechi Goro Persona 5 Protagonist Kurusu Akira Sakura Futaba (Background)Alternate Universe - Limbo Post-Canon Ages Grief/Mourning and the unlearning and relearning thereof Bittersweet Angst Death and the frank discussion thereof
    Summary
  Had they been under other circumstances, maybe Goro would be able to take some sense of satisfaction from being able to shake Akira so thoroughly. Now, though, Goro can only feel like he has intruded on something sacred. Or dangerous. He looked at the mouth of the lion’s den and walked right into it.
  Death would be easier. Any moment, now.
Leblanc is a café that serves the recently deceased. Its lone barista, Akira Kurusu, is a man of many secrets, but he has a way of easing the journey into the After for anyone who passes through Leblanc's door. That is, until his next patron is a man he thought long-dead, and he has to relearn the grieving process all over again as his carefully-cultivated space away from the troubles of his own life is cleaved in two.

    Summary
      Izuku’s life does not flash before his eyes. It’s more like it ebbs into the place of his consciousness. A slow trickle of Kacchan’s expressions, his favorite memories of Kacchan’s voice, his mother’s cooking, his mother’s tears, All Might, Kacchan, Uraraka - there were too many people and memories. He tries to focus - what does he want his last thoughts to be? Selfishly he pushes away the thoughts of his mother and of his friends. They had known he loved them. He wants to think of Katsuki.

The boys quickly come to the realization that something majorly fucked up has happened, and they're all somehow connected because of it. They must work together to find out what happened, before they're trapped in an endless limbo.
