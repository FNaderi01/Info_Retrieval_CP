          Summary:
              (alternatively titled ho ho ho merry queermas or Hi I'm Kaminari Denki and welcome to Jackass)After years of struggling to get his family to realize his intense gay crisis, Kaminari Denki accidentally spouts out that he is in fact a homosexual. One thing leads to another and one of his friends offers to help him out when his mother invites them over for the holidays. Oh what's a queer to do when pretending to play tonsil hockey with your actually attractive homie.
  Notes:
      I swear to god if anyone from the voltron fandom attacks me for this fic i'll bite off all of your fingers and crunch them one by one. This was made from a combo of tumblr otp prompts that were mushed up in a groupchat i'm in and it has no correlation to that one Klance fic.That being saidI hope you enjoy this wild fucking ride.
      Chapter 1
    Chapter Text
    Kaminari Denki had a habit of making things harder on himself than they needed to be.It was essentially a lifelong curse, one that had plagued him through his early teenage years and into the first days of his soon to be over several years of high school whilst struggling to find friends and to find himself. He'd known since the twilight of his adolescence that he was at least half, if not almost entirely gay, and once he was able to admit that to himself, talking to others about it had gotten easier. Ashido, being a close friend of his, was the first to find out- the news spreading as news does from then on. He had no qualms about telling anyone and everyone who might be curious. Everyone, that is, except for his family.
     It wasn't that he hadn't tried to tell them, but rather that his every attempt was constantly ignored. From attending pride rallies with his friends to placing rainbow stickers and buttons on just about everything he owned. Even telling them outright that he wasn't interested in women or in finding a wife later on in his life was met with nothing more than resigned sighs and shaking heads as they mumbled to themselves and one another about him fooling around too much to find love.
     Again and again, he all but spelled out for his family exactly why he hadn't so much as taken a woman to dinner since puberty, and time after time, they did not listen. There was no way to speak sense to a person who had no interest in hearing it.
     So as the finish line neared for his high school education, he gave up on trying. They'd figure it out on their own, surely. Eventually. Until then, he had too much to worry about in his own mind to dwell on what was on those of his relatives.
     It was a thought for another day, in a future far away- at least he hoped. The thought of them finding out was terrifying to say the least.
In the meantime, he busied himself with “preparing” for yet another school year- his final year at Yuuei, and pushed all thoughts of his nonexistent love life to the back of his mind.
