                                                        “Angry looks good on you.” /Requests are closed.For my girl @stevesharrlngtons because I love her and she hates Carol. It bothered Billy how you let things roll off your back with ease. He had nattered at you before when you didn’t get upset if someone took your parking spot or if one of your close girlfriends was being a cow. He was generally upset enough for the both of you, so you never bothered getting worked up. Besides, you had always been a calm person. Even your mom said that, as a baby, you didn’t make a fuss. So watching you now across the diner table, holding steam back inside your nostrils, Billy was amused. He could tell you were trying to hold in your emotions, threatening to rip through gums with your molars to do so.  Carol was still talking, sending the waitress back again with a ridiculous complaint. You didn’t know if she was scheming for free food or just being a dick because she had the power to be as the customer. Regardless, it was grinding on your last gear. Tommy was only encouraging her as he chewed loudly on ice next to Billy. This was supposed to be your small celebration, Billy taking you out for pie to say he was proud of you for getting into UCLA. Now, he knew for sure you would be coming to California with him.  You wanted to ask him about the job he said he was going to take with a friend once you got there and ask if you should apply for campus housing. Instead, Tommy and his girlfriend had crashed and taken your mood from excited to miserable. “She’s taking forever.” Carol whined, ripping pieces of Tommy’s napkin over the table. “Maybe, because this is the third time you’ve sent your fries back.” You suggested without hiding the hint of irritation in your voice. “I’m going to give her two more minutes and then I’m asking to speak to the manager.” Carol giggled toward the boys, showing off how ‘bad’ she could be . “If you’re going to do that, move.” You snapped. If you were a branch, you would have detached from the tree in one quick motion. “I’m not sitting here idly while you’re a cow to the waitress. It’s not funny, it’s obnoxious.”Billy grinned into himself, leaning against the wall from where he was sitting with impressed eyes. You stabbed another bite of piece with the prongs of your fork and wished it was Carol’s face. You weren’t looking at her anymore so you couldn’t see just how offended she was. “Your girlfriend is so lame, Billy.” Her words dripping with acid, she stared at the side of your face while informing your boyfriend. “I might be lame, but I don’t harass waitresses to feel good about myself. I’d rather be lame than an empty and vapid cow.” Since it pissed her off, you stuck with the same insult as before. Carol’s mouth dropped loudly in offence as her mind fumbled around to figure out what ‘vapid’ meant.“Why don’t you two take off?” Billy nodded at Tommy to leave,interjecting before Carol could retaliate. You were staring out the window now with your chin cradled in one hand, obviously upset. Reluctantly, Carol left as Tommy was climbing out of the booth. She passed by the waitress who was coming out with her fries in a hurry. You swore you heard her mutter 'bitch’ at you, but it didn’t bother you in the slightest. Happily, you sighed as she was finally gone. “Angry looks good on you.” Billy commented while taking an edge piece of for himself. You two didn’t agree on much, but you did have favorite pies flavors in common. “I’m kind of turned on.” He was trying to lighten the mood, but Billy was being serious. “We have to leave her a huge tip, okay?” Finally you tuned back in and said with distress. You felt horrible for the server. “Of course, that’s what you’re worried about.” Even with murder in your eyes, you still had a heart of gold. Billy put down his fork to pick up yours, offering it to you. If you let him, he would eat the whole piece to himself. Under the table, he tapped your foot with his and poked at you until you smiled.

Also wedding and grad season is just a busy time of year for me, but I have not stopped with Billy stories. Just tending to life stuff at the moment. Hope you’re all well.
