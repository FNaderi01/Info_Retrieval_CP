    Summary
      Adam Parrish has spent the last decade of his life at the Aglionby School for Boys, the latter five years as a teacher. At twenty-two, feet restless and mind yearning for more, he takes a position at The Barnes, a sprawling estate in Galway, as lush and green as the woods where he spent his childhood. His pupil is strange and her father, when finally he appears, stranger. Adam has been poor and obscure all his life; he had hoped, with time, that he might resolve the first of these difficulties at least. What he had not planned for was the possibility of happiness, or its potential costs.~No prior reading of Jane Eyre necessary.This fic is COMPLETE; I'll be posting two chapters a week until it's all uploaded.

    Summary
      “I’m Ronan, I’m a friend.”
The kid frowns now, brows pinched and chin jut out. (God, he is Adam isn’t he?)
“A friend? The Parrishs don’t have any friends.”
“Sure you do, not your parents, but you do Adam. You’ve got friends.”
The kid’s eyes scan Ronan’s face, studying him for a tell. Ronan has no idea why he feels so unnerved.
“Did Mis Maguire tell then? Did they take me away from my parents like my ma said they would?” Ronan doesn’t lie, so he just averts his gaze, gnaws on his bottom lip. “Are they angry? They’re alright aren’t they?”
“They’re fine kid.”
Adam sucks in a breath, spindly arms crossed against his chest. 
“I’m scared. I don’t know you.”
“I know,” Ronan tries not sounding so utterly helpless.

    Summary
      "Adam Parrish had the coldest brown eyes he'd every seen. He was beautiful.***For all of Ronan Lynch's terrifying demeanor, he had the warmest blue eyes Adam had every seen."----35 years ago Niall Lynch created the Cabeswater Company, a company that employed those rare people with superpowers to help average citizens and fight those that used their powers for malice and harm.Ronan Lynch is the Graywaren, Cabeswater's top and most infamous fighter. His identity is the best kept secret of the company. But he's bored.  And his doctor just died on him and now his best friend had hired his wife's ex boyfriend to be the replacement. Yippee.Adam Parrish is just trying to make it. He's been working as a doctor for average superhero for five years now, and when Richard Gansey III promotes him to be a private doctor, he simply can't turn it down. But the asshole who refuses to admit he broken a rib is pushing him to quit. He's got enough on his plate and his own secrets to deal with, he doesn't need to be babysitting a tantrum throwing adult with powers strong enough to wipe out America.The two men find answers in each other. And maybe, just maybe, they'll find love too. And also a bird.

    Summary
      This is a series of one shots about all the ways Ronan and Adam love each other.  Each chapter will read like a stand alone, but will also work as a story line. Some of these stories will have sexual situations. As of right now I don’t know how long this will be, I just plan to keep writing these over time! Enjoy! Stay tuned for the next one!

    Summary
      Adam is more surprised that he came to Ireland at all than he is to find a doorway to the Otherworld. When Persephone gives you cryptic predictions about your future, you’re almost certainly about to stumble into some magic. And for all his exterior bluster, Ronan seems almost relieved to have someone to visit Tír na nÓg with. But things turn complicated quickly when, during what was supposed to be a quick trip through the doorway, they encounter Ronan’s little brother - who is definitely human and definitely in New York. When Adam ends up back in Ireland long term, he finds himself increasingly entangled in the magic of the Lynch bookshop, the Lynch family lore, and one Lynch in particular.

    Summary
      After his dad died, Ronan wasn’t left with much to believe in. Honestly, Niall Lynch hadn’t left much for his three sons at all. No Dad, or Mom, or home - all in one fell swoop. Just an endless pit of money, like that was ever going to solve anything.
Ronan had Matthew, and Gansey, and his dreaming.
Then Ronan had Adam.
