                EYM's diverse staff must embrace cohesiveness, love of teaching, team-building, mutual respect, acceptance of differences, and commitment to the program. This gives students and families a sense of security, which encourages students to open up and trust solutions to their problems. Parents and students are challenged to be honest in their assessment in how these problems develop, so real solutions can be achieved.
