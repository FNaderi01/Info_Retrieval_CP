The Indiana Choice Scholarship Program is the largest voucher program in the United States and served 34,299 students in the 2016-17 academic year. Roughly 76 percent of Indiana’s private schools take part in the program, including almost 100 percent of Indiana’s Catholic schools, for a total of 313 schools during the 2016-17 academic year. When surveyed by researchers, school administrators said they participated for reasons relating to their school’s mission, service orientation, or finances. Though public support for school vouchers seems to be on the rise, our Spring 2018 forum experts share divergent opinions on the question of how—or even if—states should design and oversee voucher programs.
