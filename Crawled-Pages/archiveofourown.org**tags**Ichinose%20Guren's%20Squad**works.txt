    Summary
      (ON PROGRESS : UPDATE EVERY MONDAY! LOVE U GUYS, THANK YOU FOR READING AND WAITING MY WORK~ HV A NIVE DAY)The summary : Guren is no longer possessed by demon but Shinya become a vampire. Foreword :Being a Lieutenant Colonel is a very heavy and hard job. It's because the responsibility that Guren Ichinose had to carry, sometimes… it’s just too much. Bigger than his own body, vaster, greater than his desire. He’s desperate to be stronger. If he’s stronger, he can protect his teammates, his man, his family, everyone. But somehow, they all still die. A bad thing that Guren has, is he always blames himself for others’ death. With two demons by his sides – Mahiru and Noya – he thought that he will be powerful enough to end the war.Turns out, he did a lot of shit that cost him the world.

His hands were tied behind his back, wrists zip tied; they were sore and chafing from rubbing against the hard plastic.

    Summary
      Niyuki Noemi did not expect that her first year of high school would be directly aligned with the end of the world, nor did she think that she would end up standing side-by-side with a bunch of Hiiragi sheep trying to stop it. She was also not expecting to find out that her entire life had been a lie.Life is, apparently, quite good at throwing curveballs.

    Summary
      But Guren could not finish his sentence, as Shinya had leaned over and kissed him. Shinya's lips gently touched his. It happened so sudden and out of nowhere that Gurens head could not process it at all. He just felt his body react. Heat, Excitement, Fear. Everything at the same time. It was only a brief moment, only an instant, when Shinya kissed him but in that moment it felt like an eternity.--Even after the apocalypse life went on and Guren with it. There were several times his best friend kissed him and he ignored all of them, trusting Shinya enough not to tell anyone. But Guren slowly starts to realize that maybe Shinya means a lot more to him than just a friend. So this is the story of the kisses that never happened, until they finally mattered.What if things went differently after the apocalypse? What if Mahiru had no control over Guren? What if there hadn't been powerful forces that interfered? And what if Shinya just tried his luck and kissed his best friend? Multiple times. The story is based on the light novels and is an alternative storyline set after the apocalypse in 2012.Arc 1 | Chap 01 - 09 | 2013-2015Arc 2 | Chap 10 - 20 | 2015

    Summary
      Четыре года идёт Война. Четыре года они умирают, жрут крыс и спят где попало, укрывшись сырыми шинелями. Целую вечность они бросаются в бой – по наитию, зверьми, чтобы не быть убитыми, и терпят, стиснув зубы, терпят, примкнув штыки, терпят – плечом к плечу.Гурену и Шинье было по семнадцать, когда они пошли добровольцами в Имперскую армию. Они и тысячи таких же мальчишек и девчонок. Детство закончилось с первой атакой, а у них остались только они одни.
