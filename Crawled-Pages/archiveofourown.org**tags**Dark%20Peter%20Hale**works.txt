    Summary
      Derek’s goal, since he was twelve years old, is to become emancipated like his older sister. However, mowing lawns and cleaning pools isn’t as effective as he had hoped, so he applies for a job at  Kitchen Fresh, the bakery run by the sheriff’s wife. In the span of one night, he is offered an interview, breaks his foot, and has his carefully constructed tower of lies and secrets torn down around him.
Now, while Derek is closer to his goal, he finds himself adrift in a sea of agony and confusion, where the whole town has turned against him, and old and new enemies are around every corner. Through it all, he has to learn how he can be both broken and beautiful.

    Summary
      Supers and Humans stand on two sides of a great divide. After the riots of 2335, The Supernatural Citizen Registration Initiative was formed, to monitor and control all supernaturals. Under the purview of this Initiative falls the tactical division known as Shadow Law. As the leader of Strike Unit 1 and the son of the Director of the Homeland Supernatural Security Directorate, Stiles Stilinski must prove much to many. That he is a good leader, that he would do nothing to undermine the law and everything to uphold it and that he would work tirelessly with other units and his own team to quell the rebellion, the greatest threat to the SCRI. However his feelings for the super on his team, Derek Hale, may serve to endanger them both and their families, as he draws the attentions of a dangerous and ruthless man who will do whatever he can to get what he wants or burn it down if he is denied.

    Summary
      Stiles said no to the bite. Peter left him in the middle of a parking garage with a set of bent keys and enough nightmares to last a lifetime. Only maybe he didn’t. Stiles lied to Peter, he wanted the bite, Peter heard it in his heartbeat. He liked Stiles, went as far as to tell the boy that, so really it would be an insult to the both of them if Peter let him go without a reward for his troubles…right?The boy would make an excellent addition to the pack.

    Summary
      Stiles has had a rough go of things pretty much his whole life, and he thought he'd learned all of the important lessons by now: trust no one, question everything, and always have an escape plan.Then he meets Peter Hale, and it all sort of goes sideways.---------------------------------There are a lot of rough situations in this fic, so I've done my best to list out potential triggers in the notes, aside from those in the tags. If I miss something, please let me know. This is a dark story depicting a toxic relationship and is intended to be viewed as a look at 'how it gets that bad' rather than sensationalizing or fetishizing those toxic elements. There are elements that are similar to BDSM, but no BDSM etiquette to speak of, so I haven't tagged it as such.There's a happy ending, but it's a long road there. Buckle up.

    Summary
      Stiles took a deep breath, his gaze dropping from Derek’s as he turned to look back in the vanity's mirror. He looked at Derek’s distorted image in the reflection, noting how he could only see part of Derek’s body—his hand, adorned in rings, wrapped around the handle of an ornate cane.The image of a powerful man, who did not belittle himself for the sake of an uncle's bastard.Derek was much more than the rumors speculated, and Stiles was intrigued by that.~*~Or, the regency romance novel where Stiles is having Peter's baby, and Derek marries him for propriety's sake, (or so Stiles assumes).

    Summary
      Orphaned at a young age, Derek is sold into the slave market. His dynamic as an alpha, and a werewolf, make him a desirable slave to have working in Peter's alpha brothel, The Junkyard.Stiles is a 21 year old virgin omega who's tired of going through heats alone. Dating isn't a realistic prospect, so he seeks out The Junkyard, hoping to maybe find an alpha to help him through his rapidly approaching heat. Then he meets Derek, one of the Junkyard Dogs, who's also about to go into rut. And nothing could stop the pull they feel towards one another.
