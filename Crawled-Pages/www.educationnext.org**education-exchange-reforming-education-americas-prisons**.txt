The Education Exchange · Ep. 98 – June 24, 2019 – Reforming Education in America's Prisons
			There is new interest in giving adult prisoners greater access to education while they are behind bars. One bill in Congress would allow prisoners access to Pell Grants to pay for higher education, something which has not been possible since 1994.
Gerard Robinson, Executive Director of the Center for Advancing Opportunity, joins Paul E. Peterson to discuss the importance of education for men and women in prison and some different kinds of programs that could be offered.
Robinson and Elizabeth English Smith are the editors of a new book, Education for Liberation: The Politics of Promise and Reform Inside and Beyond America’s Prisons.
