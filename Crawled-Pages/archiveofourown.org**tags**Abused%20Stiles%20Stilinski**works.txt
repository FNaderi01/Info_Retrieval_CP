----- or
Stiles has been thrust into the supernatural underground and is a member of a 'wolf's Harem. Will the handsome gruff-looking stranger who wins him in a poker hand really be his key to safety, salvation, and love?

    Summary
      Stiles knew it wasn't always like this, that his father didn't always hate him, that he didn't always need to hide from fists and angry words, but for every day that passes the knowledge feels less certain. A poster in the town library changes everything, and Stiles realizes that he has to get out. After two years of saving and keeping his head down, he finally packs his backpack and leaves Beacon Hills - and his father - behind. But running away isn't a sustainable choice, and everyone needs a place to call home.

      Spit forms at the corners of Gerard’s mouth as he dips his head towards Stiles, the tendons in his neck standing out in anger. “You’d do well to end this now, boy. Give…me…the…Alpha!” Gerard glares at him with crazed eyes, glittering with rage.Stiles purses his lips to hold in a sob, then takes a long, shuddering breath. “No,” he says, quiet but resolute. “I don’t care what you do to me. I’m never gonna give you Derek Hale.”*Stiles' kidnapping and the aftermath- full of puppy Isaac, slow burn to explicit in love Sterek, and the makings of a ragtag pack family as they go

    Summary
      Stiles had never wanted to be a hunter. The more Gerard had pushed the more he'd done the complete opposite. So when Crazy evil old Gerard decides he's had enough of him, all there is left to do for Stiles is run but not without a little present which may or may not lead to a bounty on Red Riding's head, a long ass stroll through the woods and an encounter with a very hot and broody Alpha.

    Summary
  He keeps it to himself. His dirty little secret, soothing his bruises with aloe vera and hiding behind excuses if his friends notice him wincing. It’s amazing how clumsy his friends believe he is, constantly walking into things hard enough to leave marks.
Stiles is in a bad situation, but he hides it well. Or, he thought he did, until an all too observant detective moves in next door and asks for some coffee.

These two boys were kidnapped not long after they had both turned 5 years old.Eleven years later, as the Queen-Harper family is giving up hope and their search is coming to a halt, a lead in the case arises in the unlikely, small town of beacon hills.***16 years old Jackson didn't understand why his adoptive parents were so upset about his appearance on the news - if you could call their reaction upset, damn right furious seemed a more fitting description.However, he can soon grasp their reasons for secrecy when it comes to light that he wasn't adopted by strictly legal means- if kidnapping your "son" was considered not strictly legal.So, when the Harper-Queen crew pull up in town wishing to confirm his place as their missing son - and it is confirmed that he is just that- it raises the very serious question ofwhere Is his brother?

    Summary
      Sheriff Noah Stilinski couldn't figure out the Hale fire, could never bring to justice the remaining Hale survivors, Alpha Peter Hale and Alpha Derek Hale. The only way to keep peace with the two werewolves was to sign a contract, signing over his only Omega son Stiles Stilinski, over to Peter Hale. Stiles has only just turned sixteen, unaware of the contract and unaware that his first heat his coming. Peter appears at the high school to collect his prize. Will Stiles cave to the possessive Alpha, or will he fight to get back to his friend and father?

    Graphic Depictions Of ViolencePeter Hale/Stiles Stilinski they are endgame but this is a slow burn that is going to stretch over years they meet when stiles is 18 but he’s in his 20’s when they endgameStiles Stilinski Peter Hale Derek Hale Talia Hale Laura Hale Original Hale Character(s) Sheriff Stilinski Cora Hale has a twin!AU The Hale Family (Teen Wolf) Lives also Feral Stiles Stilinski Abused Stiles Stilinski POV Peter Hale Hurt Stiles Past Child Abuse Mute Stiles Stilinski Hurt Peter Hale Hurt/Comfort Eventual Happy Ending
    Summary
      There is an ironic balance to the situation that strikes Peter as especially humorous. Typically, Peter is not bitten by humans. Typically, werewolves are the ones who do the biting. But, here in the forest ringing the Hale House, there is certainly a feral human boy and he has certainly bitten Peter. It’s partly Peter’s fault. Maybe thirty percent. He had stuck his hand within biting distance.

    Summary

    Summary
      Stiles was kicked out of the pack after Theo manipulated everyone into believing he is a murderer. Bullied at school by his former friends and abused at home by his alcoholic father, he spirals into near insanity. Help comes from the most unlikely source in the form of Fiona Goode - the Supreme of the witches and apparently his aunt. Vengeance, copious amounts of alcohol and a whole new coven that instantly took him in - things just got a whole lot more interesting.
