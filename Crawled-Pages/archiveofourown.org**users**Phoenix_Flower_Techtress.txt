    Summary
      Kairi knows that Axel wants to talk about what's been bothering him. From his refusal to take off his Organization coat, to the sudden preference for his Nobody's name, to the memories he's forgotten that somehow have something to do with her and Sora. She knows that he wants, no NEEDS, to talk about it. Maybe finding a small forest of oddly shaped plants(that Axel is super excited to find) will provide them the opportunity to let their walls down for moment.AKA: The fic that explains why Kairi seemed like she wasn't even in the same room with everyone else during the meeting in Yen Sid's Tower (or that makes me less upset about it).

    Summary
      Ed is finally moving out to go to college in East City, with Alphonse in tow. Hoping this will be a chance to break free of his tortured past, Ed attempts to throw himself into college life, even going so far as starting a controversial relationship with a familiar face from the distant past. The relationship turns out to be more than he bargained for (not that that's a bad thing), Al's crushing on the land lady, Ed regains his passion for cross-dressing in private, Winry's testing the waters of her sexuality, the land lady's brother is really weird and likes to host slumber parties, and Ed's biochemistry professor wants to train him in martial arts. Things seem to be going amazingly, but in Ed's experience, good things don't tend to last, and the dark shadow haunting his childhood doesn't want to let go just yet.

    Summary
      Thor and Loki were the first of the Avengers to discover they were soul mates. However, unlike the others in the future, their newfound love does not spell happily ever after. Instead, it spells disaster, heartbreak, and most important of all, a betrayal. A betrayal so great, it will unleash a tidal wave of revenge and insanity that even these gods of legend may not be able to escape.

  Summary

  Summary
    The Asgardians believe that when an individual is born, their soul is broken in half. One side remains with them, but the other waits to be implanted into the one they are meant to be with when they are born. Sometimes the soul half waits a few minutes, or a few days, or months. But sometimes... sometimes a soul can wait years before it finds who it's looking for. On Earth, we would call them soulmates, on Asgard they are simply called the Second Half. But no matter what they are called, where they live, how many years separate them, or how much hell they go through, they will always find each other....

"I’ll have to call in the boss for this."Magnus had never met the man before, but he'd never expected this elusive "Boss" to be so goddamn HOT.

    Summary
      Jaskier likes to think of his life beginning at Oxenfurt. It’s easier that way--easier to think he is simply a human bard. He can let the memories of his parents and court and draconic life fade into the past where it belongs. And honestly, was his life really him living before studying music? What’s a bard without a song or a poet without words?Yes, things are simpler this way...most of the time. aka5 myths about dragons and 1 truth about witchers

    Summary
      Jaskier never expected to fall in love with Geralt of Rivia. But, then again, he never expected to wake up, alone, on an interstellar voyage. Isn't life just full of wonderful surprises? Or, Jaskier is one of the 5000 passengers on the Starship Avalon, travelling to a distant colony planet. After his hibernation pod malfunctions, he's stranded on a starship that won't reach its destination for another century. With no contact with Earth and only an android for company, the future is beginning to look hopeless. That is, until a certain infamous witcher wakes up too.

    Summary
      Geralt, Eskel and Lambert play a game of Hunt the Bard through the forest surrounding Kaer Morhen, where to the victor go the spoils. And then everyone else gets some of the spoils as well. Jaskier is their faux-unwilling prey and leads them on a merry chase (or so he would like you to believe).
