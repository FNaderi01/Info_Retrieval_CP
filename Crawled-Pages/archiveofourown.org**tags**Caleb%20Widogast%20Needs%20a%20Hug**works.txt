    Summary
      After Traveler Con The Mighty Nein receives a special invitation to a Ball hosted at the city of Whitestone. A mix of excitement and constant suspicious worries flow through their minds. 
Never trust anything.
“Jester, this is Allura Vysoren. It has come to my attention that the Mighty Nein has helped a very dear friend of mine once more.”  The message started in her head, Jester's heart beating faster, before she is able to respond another message came through. “When I had heard you had saved my dear friend’s mother, I was speechless. As a thank you you have all been invited to a ball.”
“By Lord Percival de Rolo of Whitestone and Lady Vex'ahlia, Baroness of the Third House of Whitestone and Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt.”
“They will send you a proper invitation soon."

    Summary
      It hurt.He knew that it hurt it had to hurt. He had seen the flames, had felt them as they were rushing through his veins, fleeing out of his fingers. He had tasted the smoke, climbing up his nose and filling his mouth, his lungs. But still, despite his best efforts to feel the pain, all that reached him, truly reached him, was an all-surrounding, all-consuming numbness.The pain, he thought, would be helpful at least. Maybe, if it was only strong enough, if it burned his skin and pierced through his body with every lingering breath, maybe then he would be able to feel the rest of it too. Pain could be a powerful tool, he knew that better than most people. Sometimes, and he knew that better than anyone, pain came with knowledge.And knowledge was the one thing he craved at this moment, more than anything.

    Summary
      Mollymauk knew something was wrong. It wasn’t that Caleb was acting all that different- he was always aloof. Always preferring the comfort of a room by himself in the lodging while the rest of the group sat at the bar drinking and laughing- a sour attempt of trying to hide the horrors of each of their pasts and nightmares they witnessed earlier that day.Maybe Molly’s suspicion rose from the fact he seemed a little more quieter than usual, clinging onto his jacket as if it was a safety jacket keeping him afloat in the middle of the sea. Or maybe it was that he seemed to have eaten just a little bit less than normal. It could have even possibly been that his hands seemed to shake just a little bit more than usual, threatening to topple liquids from his cup every time he went to take a drink.No matter the reason, Molly knew something was wrong. He could feel his heart aching for Caleb, and he couldn’t quite pinpoint why.

      Caleb Widogast wakes up and remembers nothing except his friends and this strange island. For just a moment, he is happy... and then it all comes rushing back.A closer look at the moment in C2x105 when Caleb loses his memory and is temporarily freed from the weight of all he has been through and done. With some Widojest on the side because I love them.
