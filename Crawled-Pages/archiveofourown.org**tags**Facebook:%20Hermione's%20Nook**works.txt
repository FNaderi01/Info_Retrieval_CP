    Summary
      Over the years, Hermione Granger worked hard to prove that a muggleborn was just as good as a pureblood or half blood. But what if she wasn't entirely muggleborn? After the war, after Hogwarts, Hermione finds her dream job working with the Scamanders, but even a workaholic needs a vacation once in a while. Once out of the office, though, work finds her, and a surprise inheritance comes to her out of the depths.
