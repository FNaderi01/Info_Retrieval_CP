    Summary
      Shen Yuan’s careful preparations to fake his own demise are rudely interrupted by actual death, and that should be the end of his story.But in the world of Proud Immortal Demon Way, nothing is ever quite that simple.Or: Shen Qingqiu dies while Luo Binghe is in the Abyss, and all his hard work goes to waste when the half-demon follows his original’s cold-hearted career path to the throne. However, fate (and the System) are not finished with the Demon Lord yet. And what better to throw at him than traitors, unknown diseases, and odd, suspicious civilians who know more than they should?

    Summary
      No one has ever had a successful time acclimating to transmigration. At least, that's what Shen Yuan tells himself after he accidentally breaks The System. It doesn't help that he wakes up as a teenage disciple inside of the bane of his existence- Proud Immortal Demon Way. He's trying to take precautions to avoid all the death flags that this stupid villain's body of his is going to get him into, but some other disciple really seems to have it out for him...
