^ a b c The Space Force does not have separate first sergeant ranks. These special ranks are instead positional billets denoted by a diamond within the upper field, and are senior to their non-diamond counterparts.
Rank insignia wear[edit]
  A Space Force general's OCP uniform.[2]
On the service dress uniform metal rank is worn on the epaulets.[3] On the OCP uniform, the Space Force's combat utility uniform, embroidered navy blue rank is worn on an OCP patch on the center of the chest.[2]
History[edit]
The creation of the Space Force marked the first time since the 1947 creation of the Air Force that a new branch was created. This created an interest in the rank structure and insignia. In February 2020, it was announced that the Space Force would ask military space professionals for opinions on ranks.[4]
Eighty-six graduates of the United States Air Force Academy class of 2020 commissioned directly into the USSF, becoming the service's first new officers and second lieutenants.[5] On July 28, 2020, four general officers from the Air Force were nominated to transfer to the Space Force in their current grade of major general, and then be promoted to lieutenant general.[6][7] On August 6, 2020, a number of Air Force officers are being transferred to the Space Force in the ranks of major, lieutenant colonel and colonel. [8] On September 1, 2020, the Air Force transferred 2410 active-duty airmen to the Space Force to become enlisted space professionals.[9] The space professionals were all transferred to the Space Force in their current enlisted ranks.[9][10]
All members of the Space Force currently retain their respective grade and rank carried over from the Air Force. However, it has not yet been announced what the permanent rank structure will be.[11][2]
A proposal included in the United States House of Representatives's version of the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act would require the Space Force to adopt a rank structure based on that of the United States Navy for its officers and enlisted space professionals.[12][13]
