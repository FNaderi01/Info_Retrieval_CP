  /siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh
  green bean:

  green bean:
   bullied
  green bean:

  green bean:
   a good eleven-ish years
  green bean:
   i’m fine now of course!!!
  green bean: 
  you all don’t need to worry about me :^)
  :^) hard:
   my heart
  :^) hard:
   it’s dying from the sunshine boy
  electric boogaloo:
   who tf bullied you i need to commit homicide
  sonic:
   Kaminari!
  sonic:
   As much as I believe whoever could stoop so low as to bullying someone needs some serious reprimanding, murder is not the answer!
  electric boogaloo:
   right
  electric boogaloo:
   sorry dad
  electric boogaloo:
   who tf bullied midoriya i need to give some “serious reprimanding”
  sonic:
   Kaminari.
  green bean:
   guys!!!
  green bean:
   it’s honestly fine!!!
  green bean: 
  you don’t need to worry!!!
  :^) hard: 
  hey bakugou, weren’t you and midoriya childhood friends or smth?
  :^) hard:
   why didn’t you help midoriya?
  fUCK:

  fUCK:
   subject change time!
  fUCK:
   what’s our english homework tonight
  momos before bromos:
   to read to page 120
  momos before bromos:
   but Bakugou, I would like to hear more about this
  momos before bromos: 
  it was my understanding that you two were friends before coming to UA?
  green bean:
   i mean,
  green bean: 
  friends might be a little bit of an overstatement…
  electric boogaloo:
   you literally call him “kachan”
  fUCK: 
  i will tell you if you never ever call me that again
  electric boogaloo:
   deal
  fUCK: 
  okay so i may have been one of the people bullying deku
  fUCK: 
  but it honestly wasn’t that bad
  green bean:
   yeah! it was just some messing around!
  green bean:
   i’m not even sure why i called it bullying haha
  scotch tape:
   is that why you flinch every time someone grabs you?
  green bean:
   what?
  scotch tape:
   because that’s a thing you do
  scotch tape: 
  even if it’s just one of the teachers
  scotch tape:
   you freeze and try and pull away
  scotch tape:
   it’s honestly really concerning
  bubblegummy:
   how tf did you notice something like that?
  scotch tape: 
  he really doesn’t hide it at all
  green bean:
   uh
  fUCK:
   fuck i thought you only did that around me
  green bean: 
  um
  sonic:
   Bakugou could you please explain
  fUCK:
   fuuuuuuuuuuuuck
  fUCK: 
  okay so maybe i did fuck with deku a little too much
  fUCK:
   and maybe i used my quirk on him one too many times
  :^) hard:
   yOU DID WHAT???????????
  electric boogaloo:
   fuck, now i gotta throw down with bakugou for midoriya’s honor
  green bean:
   jhsfgarehrtsghujy
  fUCK:
   you can fucking /try/ pikachu
  electric boogaloo: 
  oh i’ve been hit
  electric boogaloo: 
  it’s not like pikachu isn’t boss af
  leapfrog:
   i’m more partial to froakie
  electric boogaloo:
   understandable
  sonic:
   maybe it would be better to continue this conversation at a later date
  sonic:
   and possibly with adult supervision
  sonic:
   it is getting late and we will have to go to school tomorrow!
  electric boogaloo:
   don’t think ur off the hook bakugou
  electric boogaloo:
   i’ve still gotta fite u for midoriya’s honor

    Chapter Text
  Mina had an empty soda bottle in hand and a circle of gay teenagers in front of her, and it was time to party.
  “Alright! 
    I’ll
   go first!” Mina placed the bottle in the center of the circle and gave it a spin watching in anticipation as it spun and spun and spun until slowing down and coming to a stop on…
  “Todoroki! Truth or dare?” Mina asked, a devious glint in her eyes. Todoroki’s face, however, showed no signs of worry.
  “Truth.” Awww, that was boring! Well, Mina could work with it. She tapped her pointer finger thoughtfully on her chin as she thought.
  “Hmmm…” Then Mina snapped her fingers, “Got it! Todoroki, what was your first kiss like, and who was it with?” It was a basic question, but if Mina was right about something, she would get a nice useless 500 yen for it. Hanta, realizing this, leaned forwards a little.
  “Well…” Todoroki bashfully rubbed the back of his neck. “My first kiss was… a little awkward on my side but… Midoriya was at least somewhat experienced, certainly more so than me.” Mina let out a cry of victory and Hanta groaned and passed 500 yen over to her. Todoroki looked a little surprised, but otherwise paid it no mind.
  And then it was Todoroki’s turn to spin the bottle. He gave it a less enthusiastic spin than Mina did, and it spun a little slower until it came to a stop—pointing right at Mina.
  “Dare!” Mina shouted, a fire lit in her eyes. Todoroki gave her a long look before speaking.
  “I dare you to kiss Sero.” Mina groaned.
  “
    What
  , boring.” Mina said, scooting over to Hanta and squishing their faces together, making out for all of two seconds before pulling back and sitting back down next to Momo.
  The game went on, Mina daring Kyouka to not listen to any music for the next 24 hours, Aoyama giving 
    way
   too much info on his relationship with Shinsou, Kirishima guzzling two bottles of soda, Tokoyami choosing between his favorite emo bands, Kaminari being forced to hold hands with Bakugou for the rest of the game, before the two big events happened.
  ——
  The bottle had been spun by Tokoyami and had landed on Izuku. Izuku had nervously said truth, and Mina watched in anticipation, wondering what would be asked of Izuku. Tokoyami took his sweet time, but eventually landed on something…
  “Midoriya. What has been the 
    worst
   moment in your life.” The mood shifted from light and playful to dark and heavy in two seconds flat. Izuku shifted uncomfortably. Bakugou paused in trying to pry Kaminari’s fingers off of his own, giving Izuku a nervous look.
  “Well…” Mina’s attention was fully on her dark-haired friend, as were her classmates. “I don’t know if any of you know this, but my quirk was a mutation of sorts, it didn’t appear until I was fifteen. And before that I was completely quirkless.
  “It was always my dream though—and still is—to be a hero. And that dream was something I had for a long time, since I was old enough to really understand what heroes were. When I was four—almost five really—my mom took me to see a doctor. I hadn’t manifested a quirk, and she was starting to get worried.
  “The worst moment of my life was what that doctor told me. He told me I should give up on becoming a hero because I had no quirk to call my own. My life went a little downhill from there, but that was really the turning point.” Izuku had curled in on himself a little, leaning against Iida, Todoroki on his other side, looking concerned. Even Bakugou looked a little down.
  “Sorry for bringing down the mood, guys!” Izuku said, giving the group a bright smile. He reached into the middle and gave the bottle a spin, and it landed on Hanta, who was dared to chug another bottle of soda. Kirishima was so proud when he managed to actually do it.
  Then Hanta spun the bottle, claiming for this to be the last one the group would do for the night, because curfew was in five minutes. The bottle slowed, passing by Izuku, Iida, Kaminari, and then stopping on Bakugou, who looked up nervously at his boyfriend, and said he wanted to be dared. Hanta gave a wicked grin.
  “Katsuki. I dare you to be nice to Izuku for the next week. And that does not mean you can just avoid him to avoid doing it. Starting…” Hanta pulled out his phone and fiddled with it for a moment before saying, “Now!” Bakugou glared at Hanta, free hand sparking with power.
  “Doesn’t mean I can’t be a dick to 
    you
  .” Hanta dove across the circle, hiding behind Izuku, and making Bakugou have to address him. Bakugou looked a little awkward before he spoke.
  “Hey… Izuku.” Mina thought it was really weird to hear Bakugou talk so softly to someone. “Could you maybe… Move? So I can punch my boyfriend?” Izuku gave a little laugh, shoving Hanta in front of him.
  “Have at him Kacchan!” And have at him, he did.

  bakubro:
   didn’t want to admit it to myself i guess
  bakubro:
   because deku was quirkless and was going to get himself killed if he tried to become a hero
  bakubro:
   and i was going to get into UA and the chances of him doing that were slim to none
  bakubro:
   and so we would be separated
  bakubro:
   and i just
  bakubro:
   preemptively took measures to prevent heartbreak because of it
  bakubro:
   and then deku /did/ get into UA
  bakubro:
   and then deku had a quirk
  bakubro:
   and suddenly he was stronger than me and i couldn’t even protect him from himself
  bakubro:
   and then he fucking came to save me and i
  bakubro:
   i’m sorry izuku
  bakubro:
   i’m sorry i bullied you
  bakubro:
   i’m sorry i was so mean to you for so long
  bakubro:
   and i’m just
  bakubro:

  he screm:
   okay so we’re gonna talk about this right
  softboy:
   i didn’t know oh my god
  softboy:
   tsuyu had a crush on her so i just assumed that it would be reciprocated????
  but why tape:
   woah what
  softboy:
   i didn’t stop to think realistically
  softboy:
   oh and that’s why tsuyu was so convinced uraraka wouldn’t want to date her
  softboy:
   because she wanted to date /me/
  softboy:
   aaaaaaaaaa this is so confusing and messed up!!!!!!
  iced coffee:
   i mean
  iced coffee:
   do you like uraraka?
  softboy:
   well, yes!
  softboy:
   but as a friend, nothing more!!
  softboy:
   i admit that maybe once i had some romantic feelings for her, but she’s always been a better friend in my mind than a lover
  softboy:
   aaaaa i don’t know what to do!!!!!
  harder daddy:
   i mean it explains why she was so withdrawn when you started dating kaminari
  he screm:
   what
  harder daddy:
   yeah she like wouldn’t even look at kaminari for like a week
  pikachu~~:
   :^(
  pikachu~~:
   i remember that
  but why tape:
   i’d say we could try bringing her into our relationship but well…
  but why tape:
   i know for a fact that denki, tenya, and izuku are the only three among us who like girls, and izuku has made it pretty clear he doesn’t want a relationship with uraraka
  pikachu~~:
   and i’m pretty sure uraraka hates me :^((
  glasses™:
   nonsense!!
  glasses™:
   she was simply jealous of you at the time!!!
  glasses™:
   perhaps if izuku and i approached her, we could talk this out!
  he screm:

  The door to Ochako’s dorm cracked open an inch, revealing the slightly red-eyed face of its owner. Tsuyu’s brow furrowed in worry. Ochako opened the door further to let Tsuyu step inside, and the two sat down on Ochako’s bed, lit only by the setting sun peaking through Ochako’s curtains.
  “So.” Tsuyu began, kicking her feet lazily against the bed. “Is there a reason you were being so mean to Katsuki?” Tsuyu gave a soft ribbit as she spoke, and Ochako pulled her legs up to her chest.
  “I just…” Ochako began, twitching slightly, “It’s just really unfair, y’know? Bakugou is nice to Deku for a whole day and gets rewarded with being able to date Deku, but I’m nice to Deku for almost a year now, and he just wants to stay friends.” Ochako’s voice strained near the end, like she was trying not to let it crack. Tsuyu thought carefully over her next words.
  “Well what’s so bad about being friends?” Ochako blinked up at her. Tsuyu decided to continue. “I’ve been friends with Izuku for almost a year now—same as you—but I don’t want to stop being friends with him. He’s a good friend and I would say he’s better for me as just a friend than a boyfriend. Ribbit.” Ochako’s face turned to one of thoughtful contemplation.
  “I know, and I understand. Deku is a good friend, arguably a better friend than lover, but I just.” Ochako sighed deeply. “I wanted to have something special with him. I’m in love with him, and I’m going to 
    be 
  in love with him for who knows how long, and he’s never going to return those feelings and that 
    hurts
   Tsuyu, it really does.”
  Ochako fell back onto her bed with a soft whoosh and sighed once more. “Saying ‘at least we’ll be friends’ doesn’t help when this is going to strain our friendship to a breaking point. Regardless of if I reconcile with him or 
    whatever
  , this is gonna change how we look at each other.
  “I’ll just be some dog panting after his tail, and he’ll just be the treasure that someone else got to first.” Tsuyu gave a soft ribbit.
  “Ochako you 
    know
   that Izuku would 
    never
   think of you like that! He’s always treated you like an equal and he always will, and you know this as well as I do!” Tsuyu laid back and stared up at Ochako’s ceiling.
  “Take it from an expert on unrequited love. Sometimes, just being their friend is 
    way
   better than pushing them away because you were rejected.” Ochako let out a soft noise of inquiry.
  “Who rejected you?” She asked, and Tsuyu was almost tempted to tell her the truth.
  “Someone from my old school.” The lie came easy, and even though a deep pit of regret and sadness welled up in her every time she 
    almost
   confessed to Ochako, it was easier and safer this way. Friendship was always better that rejection.
  “Yeah well, introduce me sometime so I can kick their butt!” Tsuyu gave a soft ribbit of laughter. Yes, friendship was good.

    Chapter Text
  Shouta had watched in a mixture of mild fascination and disgust as Kaminari had once walked up to Midoriya and confessed his love before kissing the shorter boy. The disgust had come from the fact that these students honestly felt almost like his children, and thus seeing them 
    kiss
   was an… interesting sight.
  Shouta had made an educated guess that Todoroki and Iida had joined this relationship sometime after the incident with the Hero Killer Stain. The four grew closer, and often sat together at lunch. He had also inferred the relationship between Bakugou, Sero, and Kirishima—as strange as it was to think of Bakugou accepting someone’s romantic advances.
  And then the hell week started—in which Bakugou did a complete 180 in personality every time Midoriya was in the vicinity. Only when Midoriya was around, however. It was… more than a little disturbing.
  But nothing could have prepared him for when one day, as Shouta had entered the dorm’s common room to drop off a notice, he saw the two boys in his class who 
    hated each other
   and could almost never work together—regardless of the hell week still being in effect or not—kissing on the couch.
  And of course the first thing that had come to Shouta’s mind after witnessing the act was that the two were both cheating on their respective datemates, but then this theory was disproved as Kirishima casually walked down, and without a second glance towards his boyfriend, walked over to greet Shouta.
  “Hey, Aizawa-sensei! What brings you to our humble abode?” Kirishima asked, hands gesturing vaguely around him. And Shouta tried to process everything that was happening, from Bakugou and Midoriya kissing on the couch to Kirishima’s apparent nonchalance about the whole thing—and he landed on something absolutely improbable.
  “Since when are the seven of you dating?” And Kirishima gave pause, looked over at Midoriya and Bakugou and then screamed—
  “GUYS HOLY FUCK DADZAWA KNOWS!!!” Shouta was briefly offput by simply being referred to as ‘dadzawa’ even if it made him a little proud, but he shook that feeling away, turning instead to see how Bakugou and Midoriya would react to being outed.
  Midoriya’s reaction was clear and concise. He pulled away from Bakugou, made eye-contact with Shouta, and then fell off the couch with a yelp and a thump. Bakugou looked a little miffed at being interrupted, and simply stilled upon seeing Shouta. Kirishima dashed over—presumably to help Midoriya off the ground—and Bakugou maintained nervous eye-contact with his teacher.
  “Since like… A week ago.” Bakugou stated, only the slightest waver in his voice. Shouta sighed and stuck the notice he had with him onto the communal fridge with a magnet, before tiredly walking away.
  Upon returning to his lodgings he shared with Toshinori and Hizashi, Shouta did not explain why he had immediately curled into bed and not spoken a word for the rest of the night.
  (He would regret that later, when he had two days worth of grades to input, but for now, his students were making him too fucking tired.)

  Izuku thankfully did 
    not
   flinch when arms wrapped around his midsection and someone draped themselves over him.
  “I can’t believe 
    you
   of all people would 
    do
   that, Izuku!” whined Eijirou, and Izuku laughed heartily in response, earning him a knock on the head from the book in Tenya’s hand.
  “
    Eijirou
  , as much as I respect you and your interests, Izuku and I are studying, and unless you would like to 
    join
  , that means you should probably leave us alone!” Tenya spoke, his hand gestures punctuating every word.
  “Besides,” Tenya said, leaning back from where he was sitting, “The chat was a distraction for us all, and I would prefer if we stopped whipping out our phones in the middle of class.” Eijirou snaked out from behind Izuku, now sprawled across his lap.
  “Well, Izuku 
    did
   reference Noah’s Ark, and God 
    restarting
   the world, so wouldn’t that imply that the chat will be born anew? Or, something like that?” Eijirou sent a toothy grin up at Izuku, who looked up thoughtfully.
  “Well,” Izuku shrugged, “That would be telling, wouldn’t it?” Izuku snickered at Tenya’s sudden scowl, and Eijirou groaned in an exaggerated manner, rolling off of Izuku. The Chat—capitalized for emphasis—would return. Just maybe not anytime soon.

        Just wait until Dadzawa and Dad Might here about the bullying Bakugo inflicted upon Izuku. That is not going to end well.

        i rlly like the way the bullying problem is being handled. it feels like it would be hard to confront that in a group chat fic when it's usually laid back, but it works so well :) looking forward to reading the rest

        Shhhhh, first kami electrifies the trigger mechanism on his two arm grenades, rendering them useless and then prob after a few explosions and short zaps between them, he electrifies katsuki, like enough to give him a shock that leaves him confused, slightly dizzy and almost faint but not enough to kill or whatever and then he uses tht period of confusion to like sweep katsuki's feet or smthn coz our boi denki has increased his speed and  power with practice, and like katsuki falls back or smthn, hits his head and black out? or maybe denki could just KO katsuki by regulating his power enough to make katsuki faint but have no scars or lasting effectsalso, IT'S IN THE NAME OF GAY, ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN
