            tardisjournal.livejournal.comTitle: Revelation (Sequel to Indecision)Fandom: Sherlock (BBC)Author: tardisjournalSummary: Sherlock weighs the options in his own inimitable way, and makes his choice.Characters/Pairings: Sherlock Holmes, John Watson; Sherlock Holmes/John WatsonRating: RWord count: 442 (a double 221B drabble)Spoilers/Warnings: NoneA/N: Though this drabble can stand alone, I strongly suggest that you read Indecision first if you missed it the first time around. I promise it will be more fun that way. (It's a 221B, it won't take long.)Thank you to everyone that voted on LiveJournal and AO3 for the direction this sequel would take! The voting was tied for weeks. Occasionally one option would pull ahead, only to be cancelled out by the next comment. I began to fear we'd never have a clear winner. When the voting finally stopped, however, we did. By two votes. :)Written for the fan_flashworks challenge "burn".( Read more... )
