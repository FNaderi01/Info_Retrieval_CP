    Summary
      An emotionally stunted fuckwit struggles to adult and emerges from his chrysalis as a beautiful butterfly (sort of) Part II. 
  Marriage wasn’t exactly what he thought it would be like. They weren’t like married couples on the telly or in films or like his parents, who’d yelled and screamed and thrown things a lot, or like the neighbors next door growing up, who drank wine and went ballroom dancing on Friday nights. Barry felt less like his husband and more like a partner in crime, which technically he sort of was, and had been for awhile. But now it was just the two of them, heading out into the great unknown, and when he thought about all those nights he’d spent alone, sleeping on that hard mat in the community centre, he was so fucking grateful and relieved that this was how it had turned out.

    Summary
      “Simon would open up his locker every once in awhile and there’d be a mysterious object he’d never seen before sitting there on top of his comic books. A small metal penguin; an unusual puzzle, almost like a Rubiks cube, that Simon couldn’t figure out; a glass prism that cast improbable shapes and colors against the floor when he held it up to the light.”Nathan has a different power.

    Summary
  One (slightly trembling) hand, the nails covered in chipped black polish, reached out, and pointed at one of the words in the sample sentence, 'Nauta in patria poenas reginae timet.' “The trick is to start with the verb,” he said. “Timet. What’s that mean?”
 Klaus gives a stranger an impromptu Latin tutorial.

    Summary
      "He wasn’t quite sure what he expected -- maybe some bad song and dance numbers, an awkward striptease or two. He didn’t expect to enjoy it. He didn’t expect to be alternately laughing so hard he almost choked on his beer and staring, entranced, as his new friend Angel performed some kind of out-of-this world contortionist act. He didn’t expect to find himself marveling at the transformations that had gone into this performance, and he really didn’t expect to wonder how it was done. And whether he could do it."Nathan tries out drag.

    Summary
      “Everything about this world seemed wrong: all of the others were dead, and the Nathan he had known, as annoying as he was, might as well have been dead, too, because this person was nothing like him. His tone of voice, his manner of speaking, even something about his face just seemed wrong. It was as if Nathan were a shop that had gone out of business, and now it was just empty and dilapidated, haunted by old memories, with no expectation of a new owner moving in any time soon.”Takes place in the alternate universe Curtis accidentally creates in Series 1, Episode 4; except Curtis fails to turn back time and gets stuck there.

    Summary
      Aziraphale Fell isn’t exactly in the closet, but he’s not made it much further out than the hat-stand. The hairdresser at the spa where he’s just taken a job is far too flamboyant for his liking – doubtless, that’s why he can’t get the man out of his mind. His boss is a grouchy, nonbinary terror, who has an inexplicable soft spot for a priggish conservative MP from Oxfordshire. His best friend can’t stop predicting he’s fated to couple up soon. And the rent is due.

    Summary
      “Well, it’s not permanent,” Anathema said, avoiding eye contact. “It’ll wear off in seven days, but in the meantime...”She looked up at the two of them, and sighed apologetically. “You guys are gonna want to get yourselves somewhere private. Fast.”

    Summary
      “Oh God,” Aziraphale said to the empty bookshop, pouring himself another drink, “Oh, Lord, tell me, if we had been humans together, with short lifespans and squishy bits and all that.” Aziraphale interrupted himself by hiccupping. “Would we have fallen in love? Are you listening lord? If you hear me, give me a sign, please, I beg you.”Unfortunately, or fortunately--one can never really say in such ineffable circumstances--the almighty was, indeed, listening.

    Summary
      Aziraphale and Crowley, a recently demoted angel and a demon taking a pay cut, have never met. In their scrambles to get an affordable place to live, each of them places an ad online, hoping to find a human flatmate to share expenses. Crowley responds to an ad from an insomniac bon vivant and finds himself living with a stuffy, bossy homebody. Aziraphale writes back to a tidy minimalist and ends up with an obnoxious houseplant hoarder and his six pet snakes.As they each try to conceal their supernatural abilities, flat-sharing turns to fighting, fighting turns to flirting, and flirting turns to...Well, what Aziraphale and Crowley don’t know won’t hurt them, right?
