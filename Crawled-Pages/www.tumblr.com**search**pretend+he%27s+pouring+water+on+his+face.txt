For your consideration: Vilya remembers. Vilya remembers. The few she took with her, lost to the Kraken’s patient, relentless jaws. Her Aremente, ruined. Her tribe, her husband, her daughter. It’s been decades, she realizes, and her heart is gripped with sudden fear that overwhelms everything, overwhelms even the steadfast love she’s come to have for the people of this island, too. Because so much could have happened, in decades. She makes it back to camp mostly with her mind in one piece. The Mighty Nein, for all their idiosyncracies, are clearly a powerful group with powerful forces on their side, and more than that they seem willing to help. They scrap together the loose beginnings of a plan in the depth of the night and on the journey back. For the rest of the day she pretends everything is normal. She answers to “Viridian” and barely flinches. Like one achingly slow breath, the sun reaches its peak and sets again. Vilya steals into her quarters, pours water into a rough wooden bowl with trembling hands. Korrin first. Just- just to check. Buried in some notes at his desk, of course. He looks so much older than she thinks he should. He’s not wearing his mantle, though, the one that marks him as leader of their tribe. Which means- which means-Vilya thinks about her daughter: her freckled face, her reckless, toothy grin. The scry seems to falter, just for a second, and then it catches, and Vilya cannot breath.

anonymous asked:Ohp do a tj absentmindently stroking cyrus' hair. Cyrus feels awkward but good awkward. his heart beats faster than the speed of light. So sorry this was delayed and it’s kinda short as well.But I hope it’s still cute!…….Letting out a frustrated groan, Cyrus pushed his text book away from him.“I don’t wanna study anymoooore,” he whined, letting his back fall against the couch.Beside him on the floor, T.J. chuckled. “You’re giving up on studying? You?”Cyrus flashed him a pout-y glare. “Believe it or not, my life isn’t all studying, you know.”The jock chuckled again. “I suppose so. Well, we’ve been at this for hours now. Why don’t you take a nap?” He tilted his head towards the couch behind them.Both were sitting on the floor, their books and notebooks spread all over the coffee table.“But I was supposed to help you with Math after I was done.”“Math can wait for another hour. Just take a nap, Underdog.”“Hmmm.”Figuring that it was okay to take a break, Cyrus leaned back against the couch, laying his head on it and closing his eyes.“Underdog, get on the sofa.”“Don’t wanna move.”A chuckle. “Fine, but if your neck hurts, don’t blame me.”Cyrus’ consciousness was starting to leave him. “Duly noted,” he mumbled.After that, all was quite aside from the occasional sound of pages turning and pencil scratching on paper. They were surprisingly soothing and soon, Cyrus felt himself drifting off.It was a dreamless nap. And he wasn’t sure how long he was out for. But, when he finally came back to consciousness, he realized that he was no longer in the position he had fallen asleep on. In fact, instead of sitting up, he was lying on his side, his head against something firm yet comfortable. And there was a hand in his hair, fingers running through the strands.The gesture was soothing and Cyrus felt himself snuggling closer to whatever it was he was lying on, his own fingers clutching at fabric.He was drifting off again when he caught a soft sound. Humming.T.J.Like a bucket of cold water just poured on him, Cyrus was suddenly wide awake.He was lying on T.J.’s lap. Well, technically, T.J.’s thigh. And it was T.J.’s hand playing with his hair. And it was T.J. humming.That realization alone made his heart race and the blood rush to his face. The hand gripping what he now realized was the fabric of T.J.’s sweatpants loosened.Just like that, the humming stopped.“Hey, you awake?” T.J.’s voice said, softly.Cyrus could pretend he was still asleep. If only to get rid of the blush that was surely on his face so he could forget about his embarrassing display of snuggling against the other boy.But, he felt too guilty doing that.Meekly, he slowly raised himself up from T.J.’s thigh (mourning the loss of comfortable warmth in the process) and stretched, allowing his muscles to crack and un-knot.T.J. smiled, teasingly, at him. “Good nap? You were out for an hour.”Cyrus nodded, hoping the other wouldn’t notice the red on his face. Or if he did, he could blame it on sleep blushing or something, that existed, right?“How did I end up on your lap?” he asked as nonchalantly as he could.To his surprise, T.J. flushed and looked back down at his notebook. “Um… you were falling on your side and I didn’t want to move you to the couch… in case you woke up! So I… uh… figured you could just lie on my lap.” He looked up, suddenly looking shy. “I hope that’s okay?”Cyrus’ heart was beating way too fast at that moment and he was feeling dizzy from the heat on his face.“Yeah, yeah… that’s fine.” He cleared his throat and slowly got to his feet. “Um, do you want a snack?”T.J. nodded and Cyrus made his escape to the kitchen, willing his heart to calm down and his cheeks to cool off.While he was pouring juice into glasses, it dawned on him. All the strange things happening to his mind and body. All the blushing. His speeding heart. The strange need to get closer and feel the warmth.Cyrus almost dropped the carton.“Oh no,” he whispered to himself.He liked T.J.

Number 12 from the prompt list. Word Count: ~2,442Warnings: Language“Travis,” you mutter as you walk into the kitchen, clutching an empty mug in your hand. “Y/N,” he replies with as much fake distaste as you had given him. “What are you doing here?” he jokes. “It’s my parent’s house,” you comment, picking up the kettle from the stove and filling it with water before returning it to the stove. The entire time you can feel Travis’ eyes on you, watching you move around the kitchen as he leans against the island countertop. “Where’s Ryan?”  Keep reading

anonymous asked: How do UT/UF/US skelebros react to finding out his SO is on a roller derby team? Especially if it's early in the relationship, and he finds out by the SO coming to date night with a black eye from practice? UT!Sans:“woah.. buddy, what happened to your eye?”He’s concerned, definitely, and he’s instantly running through all the possible scenarios where they could have gotten hurt.  He keeps his panic bottled up on the inside, however, and appears calm and collected when he’s actually already imagining the worst-case and beginning to simmer in anger.  The whole roller derby explanation is something he doesn’t understand, but after a quick under-the-table Google on his phone, he’s amused.  He makes skating puns the rest of the date and wants to hear all of their stories.  Yeah, he’s definitely coming to watch this. UT!Papyrus:“HUMAN!  ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?  ARE YOU INJURED?  DO YOU REQUIRE ICE?”Papyrus makes a scene right there in the restaurant.  He’s so loud.  Everyone is staring.  He’s fretting and gingerly touching the bruise.  He might even straight-up pour his glass of ice water into his hand and then press a glove-ful of ice to his S/O’s face.  He doesn’t waste time trying to envision what happened; he knows that they’ll tell him if they want him to know.  And when he discovers roller derby, he pretends to know what it is so he doesn’t seem out-of-the-human-loop and offers to come along next time.  In his mind, he’s going to protect them, but when he sees what it is, he’s amazed.  His S/O is tough!  He spends the entire time shouting encouragement and strategies from the side of the rink.  From then on, he never misses a practice or a game.    UF!Sans:“uh.. sweetheart?”His eyelights are tiny pin-pricks when he spots them walk up with that black eye.  He’s hand his fair share of bruised zygomas over the years, but it bothers him to see them with a blatant bruise like that.  Automatically, he’s tense and sweating a little, but he waits for them to elaborate.  Unfortunately, Red isn’t a patient skeleton so the longer it takes to get an answer, the darker his expression is going to be.  If they didn’t realize he’s questioning the black eye, he’ll snap, “yer black eye!  what the hell happened to ya?!” which may or may not result in an argument.  He doesn’t understand what roller derby is, but he wants to go along to the next practice.  Once he sees the sport in-progress, he actually finds it pretty entertaining.. and the sight of his S/O kicking ass is sexy as hell.  Yeah, he’s into it.  He even wants them to wear the skates to the bedroom.UF!Papyrus:“YOU’RE LATE!  WHERE WERE YOU, AND.. WHAT HAPPENED?!”Papyrus started off berating them for being late for the date (even if they weren’t), but when he spots the black eye, he’s instantly a mixture of concerned and pissed off.  How dare someone strike them!  But also.. did his S/O win the fight?  Does he need to teach them proper self-defense?  Better yet, does he need to go wail on whoever did this?!  His foot is tapping impatiently, his arms are crossed, and his irritation is rising with every passing second.  He doesn’t know what roller derby is, but he pretends to hate it anyway and calls it a waste of time.  Even so, he demands to come along because it’s obviously dangerous, and he needs to supervise.  Once there, he’s intrigued by the violence, but ultimately.. finds it a little pointless.  Skating in a circle and hurting each other?  What’s to be gained from that? He doesn’t listen to the rules. However, he does give his S/O pointers, claiming they’re “DOING IT ALL WRONG” despite his limited knowledge of the sport. All of his suggestions involve illegal blocks, but he refuses to accept that.  US!Sans:“OH NO!  HUMAN, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?  DID SOMEONE HURT YOU?”This sweetheart is pouncing on his S/O in an instant, examining the injury and giving them big, puppy dog eyes that make them feel guilty about getting hurt and making him worry.  He offers to let them rest with their head in his lap if it hurts, and when they discuss roller derby, he wants to know all the details.  He’s excited to hear about this sport, but he’s also still concerned.  Why do they play it if they could get hurt?  He starts attending practices and games, and the entire time, he shouts his support while bounding up and down.  He’s the most excited one there–and the loudest.  "OH, WATCH OUT!  DUCK!  YOU’VE GOT THIS!“  US!Papyrus:“hey, you ready to.. uh.. kid?  somethin’ happen..?”Papyrus is apprehensive when he sees the black eye, his grin fading as he comes in close.  Gingerly, he grips their chin and tilts it back so he can better examine the shiner and try to determine the cause.  His gaze is sharp and searches theirs.  If someone hurt them, he’s going to want to do something about it.  The roller derby explanation makes him sigh in relief, and he drops his hand, chuckling.  He’s the only skelebro that actually knows what it is.  He thinks it’s cool that his S/O is into it, but he’ll only go to a game or two and doesn’t appear at the practices.  It’s not really his thing; he naps off and on in the stands.  However, he’s attentive to any injuries they may receive and kisses every bruise.

            so elias wakes up on the kollektiv’s couch        •    he can’t make out whether his head hurts because of all the vodka he chugged straight out of the bottle yesterday, or because of this half-naked ginger guy in a satin robe singing what seems like a karpe diem song
•    he finally opens both of his eyes and WOW HVA FAEN where is he and why is sana’s friend noora staring him right in the eye?•    “what time is it? did i… spend the night?”
        •    “ahh, good morning, mysterious friend    of noora’s! a cup of coffee? tea?”
“umm… no, thanks, a glass of water will do” though it feels like even a gallon wouldn’t make any difference•    eskild seems extra pleased with himself, sits down cross-legged next to noora and now elias feels four eyes staring at him•    noora is too polite to ask when is he leaving, and she pretends to not have 25 missed calls from sana and twice as many angry texts from her
    •    linn is peeking out of her bedroom door every 20 minutes to check whether her couch is available, letting out a loud sigh and disappearing again
•    elias’ head is buzzing and what has to be water sliding down his throat isn’t helping a tiniest bit, this cup is like a droplet of water in a desert
    •    after finishing the cup, he shyly places it on the coffee table in hopes that his face says it all and eskild will pour some more•    noora works up the courage to ask: “hey, elias… so when are you planning on going home? I think it’s getting hard for sana to cover for you”
    •    “OH SHIT!! sana saw me yesterday, didn’t she?” elias thinks. that’s it, he’s fucked, he will never live this down, how can he look into his sister’s eyes after what he’s done?    
      •    it feels like a long time until elias finally answers. by that point noora feels uncomfortable and wishes she’d never asked
    •    “yeah, I should probably get going. can you show me where the tram stop is?”
    • he doesn’t know anyone else’s names apart from noora’s so, while trying to get the duvet off himself (who cared enough to bring it to him anyway? it’s not like he would’ve noticed its absence), elias shouts: “thanks everyone, you’re all the best!! I hope to see you soon when I’m not blackout drunk falling onto your couch. I’m sorry about that!”
• eskild shoves noora away from the door, suddenly all dressed and ready to walk elias to the tram stop (not that noora would mind staying home, it’s 9:30 am and she’s barely had any sleep)
    • eskild is a dad friend and, even though he’ll never admit it, he misses being a cool parent to isak - that’s why he takes the first opportunity to be a caretaker, even if that means exiting the apartment early in the morning to walk a hungover boy to the tram stop that’s really just on the other side of the road

I haven’t written Logicality in months! This’ll be fun :)Summary: Logan comes to a startling conclusion, late one night.Warnings: Uh insomnia, panic, it’s Very Soft but also the ending is ambiguous and not very happy, lemme know if there’s anything else!Logan was hardly one for sentimentality. This came as a surprise to absolutely no one. He understood the concept of nostalgia, knew that some people could benefit from the occasional bout of reminiscence — but he also knew that Thomas was not one of those people. Nostalgia only served to hinder them, in small doses, and incapacitate them in big ones.Furthermore, nostalgia had nothing to do with his core duties. Sure, a side could stray from their core duties and enjoy other pastimes, if they were so inclined, but Logan was not so inclined. Each of his hobbies looped back to his own core; he even carefully structured his relaxation so it would contribute to his duties. Everything he did, he did for Thomas. Anything that didn’t fit his role couldn’t be allowed to be a part of his routine.Nostalgia hardly fit his role.So why couldn’t he stop reminiscing? Keep reading

just the messenger 「Overhaul」Originally posted by krystenritterjust the messenger 「Overhaul」fandom : Boku No Hero Academiapairing : Overhaul/Reader. summary : what are you to do when caught in the cookie jar? word count : 1165TW : slight spoilers idk. Maybe.──────ೋღ🌺ღೋ────────Sitting on the edge of the creaky motel bed. You examined the photographs.“His villain name is Overhaul-“I know that!” Tomura hissed in the phone. “Is there anything in particular I should know about?”“Well I wasn’t done-”“-Sorry.”“-talking.” Tomura got silent and you began to speak with confidence. “Okay, real name is Kai Chisaki, he’s not only involved with the Yakuza.”You paused. “He’s the main head of the once was considered dead Shie Hassaikai until now of course.”“Yes, I remember Master had showed me his photo.”You scratched your head. “Are you sure you’re in need of my help then?”Tomura sighed. “No, now that he’s gone and Kirogiri is-” Tomura got quiet. “Ironic as it is with your work. Right now you’re the only person I can trust.”You beamed, “Aw how kind!”You reached over to your nightstand for a pen and clicked it.“His quirk is..” your smile faded. “You sure he made things explode?”Tomura winced. “Yes.”You looked out the neon sign as it flickered. “How’s everyone taking it?”“We’ll get our revenge..” He took a breath. You rested your legs against your chest and looked down. “But for now…” he trailed off.“Honestly Toma, this guy doesn’t sound very safe.”Tomura scoffed at your nickname. “I can handle myself.”You lifted the police reports. “It’s not a matter of that,” you bit on your lip and gripped the phone.“Just be careful.”Tomura fingers scratched his neck lightly, “It seems that he doesn’t want to fight, he gave his card.”“W-Wait not only do you know already about this guy and have his contact information why are you talking to me?!”Tomura got red, “Because I need to know what I’m getting into.”He glanced at Toga and Twice bandaging Compress arm.“Are you trying to get me arrested or end up in a body bag?!”Tomura trailed his pinky over the rim of the dusty shot glass.“This isn’t one of your video games I have only one life.”“Hey, hey you’re one of the only people that can do that, gather information.”You scoffed. “Oh yeah besides the police finding out there’s a mole, I have to watch out for a a gang lord?”Tomura became hesitant. “Yes.”You fell back on the bed. “Alright I’ll dig around and see what I find.”“Thank you.” You hung up and stared at the lamp.You left the tv on, eyes slowly closing shut.A harsh voice in a loudspeaker jolted you awake.Now.You gasped at the sudden numbness of your chained down legs. Your arms were raised above and chained on each side of the room.Your head felt like something was squeezing it tightly.You could barely hear the faint sounds of pouring rain and the rumbling of thunder.As if you were underground.“We’ve tried everything to sedate them but they keep-”“It’s alright, it’s time to have a little chat.”You squint your eyes against the harsh lightning.“But-but they must be contained!”“And they are.”The figure unlocked the door.You shut your eyes and pretended to be asleep.You heard footsteps and then nothing.SPLASH!!You shivered from the cold water being poured on you.You squinted at the two figures, one very small man and him.The small figure smirked, “Wake up!”You gritted your teeth from the cold water.The small man claps his hands. “Let’s start with the obvious would you like to tell us anything?”You remained silent.The small man scoffed and then he smack you hard.You spat blood in his face. The red dripping onto his white of his mask.He wiped it in disgust.“Silence will not save you here.” He hissed.The water soaked your hospital gown and you turned your head.The taller figure raised his hand, “Leave us.”Overhaul waved his hand and his followers left the room. The smaller man opened his mouth to protest then he quickly sneered at you. Slamming the door behind him. The man got closer to you and watched as you were shaking.“Eri.”The door opened again this time was a small girl holding a cup.Her eyes flickered towards your cuffs, then at the bruise forming on your lip.She made you gulp down the water. Making you cold again, she glanced at your bandaged arms and legs and then towards her own.“That’s all Eri.” She blinked and stepped away, clenching on a staff.You coughed and tugged down your chains. He smirked. “Now that you have a working voice-”“Got to hell.” You coughed up the water.The figure halted his speech. “I give you permission to speak, and that’s what you respond with?”You spit at his feet, “Given my situation.” You smiled.“What would you say Kai?”He lowered his voice.  “Who are you?”You clicked your tongue and looked away, “Before that can I point out the fact I’m not wearing very comfortable underwear.” You blinked. “Speaking of which may I asked who undressed me?”“And you are chained up. Now you can’t escape with your quirk, you sick animal-”“I actually don’t have one.” You raised a finger.Kai eyebrows raised, “Oh well what a lousy assassin you would be.”“Not one of those either.” You purse your lips together. “No you see, if I was to tell you I’m a fashion designer that is inspired by those bird masks.” You gave him a smug look. “Would you believe me?”“You’re lying, there’s no way.” He shook his head, and you huffed in annoyance.“Okay maybe I’m not a designer, but why else do you think I didn’t fight back?”  They went silent and you tilted your head. “For what? ‘To save my energy’?” You laughed and threw your head back. “God gimme me a break.”“Not everyone wants to be a hero,” you raised an eyebrow. “Or the villain.”Chisaki glared at you before taking off his gloves.The little girl looked away and he raised his hand.Suddenly your chains on your arms disappeared, not like Tomura’s decay it exploded. Your head would’ve hit the pavement hard for not the second chain locking your right hand, he did the same to your other arm and collapsed on the wet floor.“Bring it in.”Eri gave him the staff from her grasp.Using a staff, Kai lifted your chin up forcing you to look up at him.“You are to rot in here until you decide to swallow your pride and talk to me.”Besides the fact his mouth was covered you could tell he was grinning madly.You gave him a dirty look, “What nothing to say?”He pulled back and you fell down, wet and helpless.Eri stared at you, coughing up water and blood.“Eri!”She gasped, rushing to Overhaul’s side.The main lights were shut off, leaving you in the dark.“I hope you got what you wanted.”──────ೋღ🌺ღೋ────────Part 2? Let me know!

nalgenewhore  asked:omg drunk rowan telling lorcan he likes boys 👀i like this one very muchOriginally posted by dincolodeumbreAelin had plied him with vodka shots all night and now Rowan danced with her, not caring what anyone else thought in the crowd of bodies in the frat house. Laughing, he spun her around until they got dizzy and found a corner to collapse in. One where thankfully no one was making out in.“Imma get water,” Aelin slurred, stumbling off to hunt down a bottle of water. Rowan watched her leave, resting his eyes for a second.Next thing he knew it was very, very bumpy. And it smelled good. Like cedar, not booze and sweat and sex. With a dopey smile, he poked the back of whoever was carrying him.“What now, Whitethorn?” Lorcan hissed. Rowan shrieked, wriggling until he was set down. “Hellas help me. I’m taking you home. Unless you can walk now. You fell asleep at the party, gods know how you managed that.”Rowan could barely stand, let alone focus enough to force the two blurry images of his very tall, dark and stormy roommate into one. He tried to take a step and lost his balance, falling onto the concrete sidewalk. Then Lorcan slung him over his shoulder again like he was a sack of potatoes and this time Rowan didn’t fight it. He just toyed with the fluffy little tail of Lorcan’s long braid, pretending it was a paintbrush on the black leather of his jacket. Keep reading

[12:22]“Hyung, are you sure you know what you’re doing?” Hansol asks Soonyoung varily, unsure if his hair was in good hands. Soonyoung continues applying hair dye to Hansol’s hair as he replies, “Yeah of course! Our stylists do this all the time and it’s not really that difficult for them, so why would it be for me?” Hansol thinks this over briefly, before shrugging his shoulders. He was only trying to dye his hair a light blue, how could that possibly go wrong? In reality, Hansol was going to regret shrugging off his worries to let his hyung continue dying his hair. “Y/n is gonna love this! I can’t wait to take all the credit for your new look!“ Soonyoung grinned happily, completely confident in his skills. At the time Hansol had laughed at his hyung’s antics while he hoped you would like his hair once it was finished. "Alrighty, let’s see the work of my magic hands!” Soonyoung excitedly unveiled the old towel he had wrapped around Hansol’s hair to let the hair dye sit. “JOKES ON JOSHUA THIS CAME OUT GREA-” Soonyoung paused abruptly, panic coursing through his veins when he realized that Hansol’s hair was not the light baby blue he had been hoping for. It was green. Poor Hansol looked like a highlighter. “What’s Y/n’s favorite color?” the panicked blonde asked urgently. “It’s light blue, why are you asking? Didn’t I mention that when we were shopping for hair dye?” Hansol replies calmly, unaware of his unfortunate hair situation. Soonyoung nervously giggles, “Do you think they’ll like neon green?”Hansol froze. There was no way this could have happened to him. This was only a trope used in movies, right? “Hyung, pass me the mirror,” he says with panic lacing his every word. Soonyoung reluctantly complies and hangs his head in shame when Hansol lets out a scream of horror. Shortly after his outburst, Joshua comes into the room with a worried expression on his face that disappears the moment he sees Hansol’s hair. Joshua bursts into laughter, his melodic laugh bouncing off of the walls so loudly that he attracts the attention of another member.“Mingyu owes me fifteen bucks!” is all Joshua manages to get out before bursting into another fit of giggles. The man in question only sighs in defeat as he walks into the room, “Hyung, you were supposed to do a good job!” Soonyoung jumps to defend himself, “I THOUGHT I DID! It was supposed to be blue when I took off the tow-” but the loud ring of the doorbell causes him to freeze. Hansol panics even more, the last thing he wanted was to look like this when he was supposed to go on a date with you. He was about to suggest that he could pretend to be deathly ill so that you’d go home but he faintly heard the door open. You made small talk with Seungcheol and Hansol knew he was running out of time. “What are we gonna do?!” he asks Soonyoung.“I don’t know!” the blonde replies, hurriedly looking around the room when he suddenly gets an idea. “Wrap this around your head! We’ll pretend you just got out the shower and buy time long enough for us to think of something.” Soonyoung then grabs his water bottle and pours a bunch of water all over Hansol’s face, which of course ends up soaking his shirt. “If you just got out of the shower why do you have a shirt on?” Joshua casually pipes up. He and Mingyu had made themselves comfortable on Soonyoung’s bed, enjoying how amusing the entire situation was. Hansol rushed to take off his shirt at the same time that Soonyoung attempted to help take it off of him. This made for an interesting scene when you entered the room your boyfriend shared with Soonyoung, as the two boys were wrestling to get your boyfriend’s shirt off. “Uh, should I come back later?” you ask cautiously, not even sure of what was going on. The two boys froze when they heard your voice and scrambled to get up. Unfortunately, for Hansol the towel slipped from his head in his haste, revealing his messily dyed hair. Everyone looked at you, half the room dreading your response and the other half anticipating it.All you could do was sigh and look toward Soonyoung, “I’m assuming this had to do with you but it’s okay. I’m not mad.” He lets out a breath he didn’t know he was holding in and smiles in relief. Looking toward your boyfriend you ruffled Hansol’s hair affectionately. “Let’s go to an actual stylist and get you fixed up, babe.”
