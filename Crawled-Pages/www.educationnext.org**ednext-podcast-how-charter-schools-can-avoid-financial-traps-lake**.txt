EdNext Podcast · Ep. 84 – May 10, 2017: How Charter Schools Can Avoid Financial Traps
			One of the key advantages charter schools have is the ability to start from scratch financially. However, that advantage can quickly erode if charter schools make the same decisions as their district predecessors when it comes to spending on buildings, employees, and retirees.
In this episode, Marty West talks with Robin Lake about pitfalls that charter school entrepreneurs and those who support them need to avoid.
Robin Lake is the director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education at the University of Washington. She says more about this subject in a blog post she wrote with Paul Hill, “Charters Must Avoid Recreating the Failed School District Financial Model.”
The EdNext Podcast is available on iTunes, Google Play, Soundcloud, Stitcher and here every Wednesday
