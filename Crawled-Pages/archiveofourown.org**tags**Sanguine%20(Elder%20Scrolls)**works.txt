    Summary
      Mercenary, treasure hunter...prostitute? Keeran-Rei is an unlikely hero with an unlikely combination of professions. With dragons returning to Skyrim, he must contend with lost memories, a civil war, horny monsters and inconsistent laws regarding public nudity. All while traveling with his new best friend, Inigo the Brave.Originally just something I started as a writing exercise, then I started to get really invested, so I hope you're enjoying it. Comments more than welcome.

    Summary
      The Daedric Prince Sanguine, whose sphere was hedonistic revelry, debauchery, and passionate indulgences of darker natures, was currently suffering from the worst hangover in his entire existence. Vague memories of a deal gone wrong are all that he can recall of the last few weeks. To make matters worse, he found himself stuck wandering around with a virtuous, vindictive vixen and a young Vigilant of Stendarr as his only clues to what he'd done on what was clearly his most epic bender to date.Now, if only he could remember it.

    Summary
      A Redguard Mage and an Akaviri Dragonslayer are forced to travel the harsh world of Skyrim in search of meaning, someone who'll stop gawking at how impossible they both are and help them, and whoever keeps letting dragons loose all over the country. So far, the native Nords aren't very helpful, even when they're actually trying to help. The gods are even worse, but when are they not? Every lesson gets harsher, the snow gets deeper, and their sanity a little thinner.

      "Nothing about this felt real, ‘Maybe I’ve been dreaming all along.’ wondered Juniper as she and Jenassa followed Irileth down to the front gates. There was a knot in her stomach and her hands threatened to visibly tremble. 
Jenassa put a hand on her shoulder and said softly “Survive now, worry later.”
Juniper took a deep, shaking breath, nodded at Jenassa, and followed the company of soldiers to the watchtower."

    Summary
      The gods disapprove of the mortal currently destined to be the Dragonborn, so a new one is found and brought to Skyrim. Unfortunately, she's from a different dimension and doesn't like the sound of this whole "hero" thing. So, Akatosh gives her a deal she literally can't refuse: she gets sent to Skyrim two years before Alduin's return to prepare herself to fight the World Eater. If the original Dragonborn takes their rightful place, then she gets to go home; if not, Alduin awaits. Sounds like no big deal, right? Well, not so much. Nirn has more to offer than what a video game can show, and Rowan's right in the middle of it.Alternately: The destination may be your destiny, but how you get there isn't.

    Summary
      He was not chosen by the Gods, he is just who remains. The Last Dragonborn is dead and no one is left to stop Alduin and his consumption of the world. Landfall is here. The dreamer is finally becoming awake. It is up to Arvel the Swift, the down on his luck thief of Bleak Falls Barrow, to somehow find a way to save the world. He and his friends must defeat Alduin without destiny on their side. Normal people must do the work of demigods and the divines. The task is supposed to be impossible, but the truth isn't always easy to see. This story includes original characters and existing cannon characters from Skyrim, Oblivion, and Morrowind. It is a complete retcon of the story to defeat Alduin. Skyrim and its story are fundamentally changed without the presence of the prophesied hero. This is my project during quarantine, so hopefully this will be updated a lot.

    Summary
      Started as one shots now I got some semblance of plot(when did that happen?).  Story of Alcestira Esdrassius after someone (Mannimarco) shoved a knife in her chest and she was picked by the divines to become the Hero of Tamriel.  She considers her life a joke as everyone keeps getting interested in her (nonexistent) love life after she saved Nirn.  Especially since she beat Molag Bal(and other Daedric Princes) like an unstoppable beacon of Divine Will. Post-main storyline.  Flashback chapters will be marked as they appear.

    Summary
      Threnod's been ordered to 'have fun' by Lord Sanguine, so she has to figure out how to do that and learn what normal people do for entertainment. She's been in a dozen taverns and she sees a lot of bards. They seem to have a lot of fun...Solitude is big enough that she figures it'll be easier to disappear into a crowd and maybe lose the title and reclaim her name. And the Bard's College happens to be there.

    Summary
      A Sister of Dibella enters the city of Whiterun, her hair the color of flame, with her trusted Orc companion. Across the land from the mountainous peak of Solitude, to the valleys of the Rift, Skyrim is embroiled in civil war. In Markarth, a sinister foe looms over the City of Stone, as lustful as it is murderous. In the forests of Falkreath, assassins take arms against a wandering trio, eager to rebuild the fear of their group's name. In this land, a princess is on the run; priestesses surround a young girl for a long-awaited ritual; and Daedric forces pull their strings of chaos. The roads these traveling Sisters take are long and arduous, wrought with danger and secrets waiting to be unleashed. Dibella, guide these women; see them safe into your loving embrace.
