California State University, Dominguez Hills (CSUDH) and the California State University Board of Trustees will bestow an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree on 2012 Olympic gold medalist and CSUDH alumna Carmelita Jeter on May 17, at 6:30 p.m., during CSUDH’s 2019 Commencement Ceremony.
Jeter, who earned a bachelor’s degree in physical education from CSUDH in 2006, will be recognized for her athletic achievements and continued contributions to the sport of track and field, her dedication to her community, and her success as a speaker and businesswoman. She will receive the honorary degree and give the keynote address at the College of Health, Human Services and Nursing ceremony – one of six commencement ceremonies taking place May 17 and 18 in the Dignity Health Sports Park Tennis Stadium, located on the CSUDH campus.
Born and raised in Southern California, Jeter started her athletic career at Torrance’s Bishop Montgomery High School as a member of the basketball team. In order to stay fit during the off-season, she tried out for the track and field team. From the moment she stepped onto the track, her incredible sprinting talent was impossible to ignore.
        ADVERTISEMENT        
After graduating from Bishop Montgomery, Jeter enrolled at CSUDH where she became the most decorated female athlete in university history. She set five CSUDH records that still stand, and won six All-America awards.During the 2012 Olympics, Jeter anchored the U.S. Olympic 4x100m relay team to take home gold. She became one of the few U.S. athletes to medal in both the 100m and 200m race at an Olympic Games, earning both the silver in the 100m and bronze in the 200m.
Prior to her Olympic victories, Jeter earned the title “Fastest Woman Alive” for her personal time of 10.64 seconds in the 100-meter dash at the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix in 2009. She continued to live up to that title when she won the 100m race at the IAAF Diamond League in 2010, both the 100m and 200m races in 2011, and by winning the 100m finals at the USA Outdoor Championships and the IAAF World Championship in Athletics. U.S.A Track and Field presented Jeter with the 2011 Jesse Owens Athlete of the Year Award.

In addition to her success on the track, Jeter is deeply involved in community and philanthropic efforts, particularly those focused on health and fitness. She has organized community track clinics for youth and served as an ambassador for the Healthy Compton initiative, a citywide program designed to promote healthy lifestyle choices.
When her aunt was diagnosed with breast cancer, Jeter used her platform as a record-setting athlete to raise awareness, collaborating with Nike on hot pink spikes that she wore in competition. In 2015, she was named the official ambassador for Susan G. Komen’s California Circle of Promise Initiative, designed to promote breast cancer awareness among African American women.
Jeter will be one of six CSUDH alumni to serve as this year’s commencement keynote speakers, bringing words of inspiration to approximately 3,600 baccalaureate and master candidates and 36,000 friends and family.
