    Summary
      He wasn't going to explain to Diego why exactly he was following Allison's every move with his eyes because he didn't own anybody any explanations, especially not his simpleton of a brother who seemed to think that every Alpha was going to pounce on Allison at the first sign of any heat. Allison's decision to spend her heat in the house leads Five to a small realization - and even smaller desire - but he will kill a thousand men before admitting to it.

    Summary
      “Diego, meet Gabriel Benjamin Hargreeves.” Klaus said softly. Diego smiled, tears in his eyes as he cradled their son.“Fuck, we’re going to have a lot of explaining to do.” Diego said sounding breathless and in a state of wonder. Klaus let out a soft chuckle.“I don’t think Five is going to be surprised. Everyone else is going to have kittens.” Klaus said stroking Gabe’s little cheek as the baby’s eyes drooped.
