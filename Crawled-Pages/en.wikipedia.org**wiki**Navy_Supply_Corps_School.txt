The Navy Supply Corps School (NSCS) is a 27-week training and "Basic Qualification Course" (BQC) in the United States.[1] Those who complete the course become Commissioned officers in the Navy Supply Corps.
The Navy Supply School is located in Newport, Rhode Island.  It was previously located in Athens, Georgia, until 2011, when the campus was closed due to budget cuts. The land the school once occupied is now being used by the Augusta University/University of Georgia (AU/UGA) Medical Partnership as the part of the UGA Health Science Campus.[2]
History[edit]
The origins of the Navy Supply Corps School date back to 1905, where the Naval Pay Officers School was established at the Navy Department in Washington DC. This school closed three months after opening. In 1918 the Officers Material School for Supply Corps was established at Princeton University to manage the influx of officers being qualified for assignments during World War I.[3]
