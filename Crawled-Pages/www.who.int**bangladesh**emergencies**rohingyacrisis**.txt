Bangladesh - Rohingya Crisis
Responding to health needs of vulnerable population
Since 25 August more than half a million people have arrived in Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar area from Myanmar. Most of them have gathered in makeshift or spontaneous settlements. Poor nutrition, communicable diseases (including vaccine-preventable and water-borne diseases), injuries and other concerns such as mental health provide immense public health challenges that the Ministry of Health, Bangladesh, WHO and other health partners are working to address.WHO is working closely with IOM, UNFPA, UNICEF and other health partners in ensuring adequate health services are provided to the vulnerable population.
