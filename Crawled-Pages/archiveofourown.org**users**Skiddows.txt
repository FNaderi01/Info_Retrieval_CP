    Summary
      “Look! Snailey!”“Did you already name the snail and get super attached? Because I am not helping you raise a snail, Luz.”“Of course not!” Luz said, with her most innocent eyes.She had known the girl about six hours. It felt like it had swept by in six seconds, but that hardly mattered. And yet, she already feels like she’s known Luz her whole life.Maybe she has, in a way. Kinda. Somehow.Amity doesn’t even know what that means - but, somehow, the thought is slightly comforting.
