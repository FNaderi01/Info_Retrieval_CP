Muggle/Wizard Relations
    Summary
      Dark Wizards are not as dangerous as someone with a heart of gold who wants to change the world. Sparrow begins her school year with noble goals, and the fire of youth in her heart. She sees her land in decay, she sees her people in misery, she has a tool in her hand that could bring life to the hills again, and yet, if she uses it, she knows the law will oppose her for the sake of upholding Secrecy.She spends the first part of this first volume, her fourth year of schooling, in coming to a greater love and humility, lest all perish for her noble goals. She must admit that she may be wrong, must be willing to seek consensus, must be willing to surrender to everyone's decision.The trouble is, everyone means everyone, including the people she can't tell about magic.

    Summary
      What did Evelyn want? It had been her fondest wish for years now: the eradication of Supers entirely. It wouldn't hurt to take a moment to fulfill wants of a different nature, though, would it? Especially since her plan was going so well.

Self-Hatred Hand Jobs Ineffable Husbands (Good Omens)
    Summary
      “Oh, I’d watch my mouth here, I really would,” the man scolded, although it was clear he was more frightened than anything. “I only wanted to help!”Crowley shook his head and let out a low whistle. “You helped, all right,” he said. “More than helped. What are you, a bona fide angel?”The angel in question went pale, and Crowley wondered what exactly he’d said wrong this time. That was him, always mucking up conversations; shit like this was why he didn’t really talk to people except for those he trusted, and trust was a bit hard to come by when you were always railing at God for making kids sick.(Aziraphale Fell is a reclusive immunologist and Anthony Crowley is a cardiologist with a chip on his shoulder. Together, they seek to solve a high-stakes medical mystery while fighting feelings they’ve tried to ignore for sixteen years.)
