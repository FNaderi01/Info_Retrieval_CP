ladymisskvir:ladymisskvir:ladymisskvir:“hook up culture” just say having sex. Just say casual, premarital sex. dont pretend like ur some elite critical voice talking about “a culture,” u just hate the idea of casual sex for whatever reason.Also I’m sorry but every generation before us fucked way more than we do. Every study shows us trending as having way less sex than boomers and gen x. Like I’m sorry ur frustrated that you get no good matches on tinder but I promise “social media is turning us all into decadent sluts” is, unfortunately, not a true statement.Its like, we live in the loneliest, most alienated, most anhedonic generation so far, bc thats what the continued development of capitalism means for us as subjects. We are more atomized and disciplined and submissive than ever.
