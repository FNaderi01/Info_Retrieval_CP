                 Mini Bio
                Hi!I'm Ateana, previously also Anyssia and OceanAndSpace.I’ve been in fandom for… a few decades, long enough to remember Yahoo Groups, Delicious, Geocities, and LJ and Six Apart/the Russians, among other things.I read a lot but I don't participate that much in fandom. That said, you are very welcome to contact me through Dreamwidth/comment on entries. I can also be found at     Twitter and AO3.  And Discord, in the Just Write server, a lot lol.Fandom wise, I sometimes do short visits in new fandoms, but mostly I stay in the same old, same old. My first main fandom was Buffy, then Final Fantasy VII. I still read/write for FFVII. Then Stargate (mostly Atlantis), The Hobbit, MCU/Tony Stark, and more recently, Teen Wolf, Hannibal, Assassin's Creed, and MDZS/The Untamed.  And of course, Harry Potter still.See you!     2020-03-29
