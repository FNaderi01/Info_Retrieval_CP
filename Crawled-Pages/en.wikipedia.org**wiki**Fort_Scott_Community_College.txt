History[edit]
Fort Scott is the oldest community college in Kansas, founded in 1919. (Highland Community College is older, but was not founded as a junior college.)
Campuses[edit]
The main campus is in Fort Scott on Horton Street, but there are satellite locations in other cities in Crawford County, including Pittsburg and Frontenac, along with sites in Paola and at Hillsdale, Kansas.[2]
Fort Scott Community College has had a full service outreach center in Paola for more than a decade. Students at the Miami County Campus can take day, evening, weekend, or online classes. In addition, the Miami County Campus also offers counseling services, remedial classes, and workshops. In the newly renovated facility, a community room is also available for public use.[3]
Academic profile[edit]
The college has 2000 students.[4] The Pittsburg campus offers classes in Administrative Assistant, Business Computers, Construction Trades, Cosmetology, Harley-Davidson Technician, John Deere Ag Technician, Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning, &amp; Refrigeration, Manicurist, Masonry, Medical Office Assistant, and Welding.[5] The FSCC sites in Frontenac have courses covering Harley Davidson and John Deere training.[6]
Athletics[edit]
Main article: Fort Scott Greyhounds
Fort Scott Community College's mascot is Gizmo the Greyhound. The school colors are maroon and gray.
FSCC sponsors football, volleyball, men's and women's basketball, baseball and softball programs which compete in the Kansas Jayhawk Community College Conference, which is a member of the National Junior College Athletic Association. There are also men's and women's rodeo teams, which compete in the Central Plains Region of the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association. Track and cross-country were dropped by the school prior to the 2010-11 academic year due to a lack of participation. Fort Scott's football team won the 1970 NJCAA National Championship and was national-runner up in 1971, 1972 and 2009.
