David Corn (born February 20, 1959) is an American political journalist and author. He is the Washington, D.C. bureau chief for Mother Jones and perhaps best known as a cable television commentator.[1] He had previously been the Washington editor for The Nation and appeared regularly on FOX News, MSNBC, National Public Radio, and BloggingHeads.tv opposite various other media personalities. Corn appeared on FOX News more than sixty times, according to a tally by Politifact.com, before becoming a frequent commentator on MSNBC.[2] As a result of his prominence from his cable television appearances, he has garnered as much as $12,000 for appearances and speeches, for addressing such topics as "What’s Right with the Left &amp; What’s Wrong with the Right?” and
“What’s the State of the American News Media?" He is also a regular attendee of the White House Correspondents Dinner and he is a longstanding member of the Gridiron Club.[3]
In February 2013, he was named winner of the 2012 George Polk Award in journalism in the category of political reporting for his posting of a video and his reporting of the "47 percent story," Republican nominee Mitt Romney's videoed meeting with donors during the 2012 presidential campaign.[4]
Corn has also been a literary critic himself.[citation needed]
On one occasion, he criticized his own organization when Nation Books published the translation of a controversial French book on Osama bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks. Forbidden Truth: US-Taliban Secret Oil Diplomacy and the Failed Hunt for Bin Laden, by Jean-Charles Brisard and Guillaume Dasquié, suggests that the attacks resulted from a breakdown in talks between the Taliban and the United States to run an oil pipeline through Afghanistan. Corn argued that publishing "contrived conspiracy theories" undermined his ability to expose actual governmental misbehavior.  Others involved in the controversy argued that Corn was interfering with the First Amendment rights of both the author and publisher, and that Corn had the right to criticize it, but should not have tried to suppress its publication.[5]

Early life and education[edit]
Corn was raised in a Jewish family[6] in White Plains, New York.[7] He graduated from White Plains High School in 1977. He attended Brown University, where he majored in history and worked for The Brown Daily Herald.[7] After his junior year, he interned at The Nation where he accepted a job as editorial assistant instead of returning to finish his degree.[7] He earned his remaining credits at Columbia University and received a B.A. from Brown in 1982.[7] He joined Mother Jones in 2007.[7]
Career[edit]
Books[edit]
Corn's first book was Blond Ghost: Ted Shackley and the CIA's Crusades, a 1994 biography of longtime Central Intelligence Agency official Ted Shackley, which received mixed reviews. The book used Shackley's climb through the CIA bureaucracy to illustrate how the Agency worked and to follow some of its Cold War-era covert operations. In The Washington Post, Roger Warner called it "an impressive feat of research"; but, in The New York Times, Joseph Finder asserted that Corn distorted history seriously to blame Shackley for a series of institutional CIA failings and pointed out a series of serious errors in the book. Among them, Finder said, was that Corn "recycled a long-discredited canard, much beloved by conspiracy theorists, that on the day of President John F. Kennedy's assassination, the agency's chief of covert operations, Desmond FitzGerald, met in Paris with one of the C.I.A.'s Cuban agents and gave him a 'ball-point pen' that could be used to inject Castro with a deadly toxin called Black Leaf 40. FitzGerald was actually the host of a lunch in Washington at the time, at the City Tavern Club in Georgetown."[8][9]
Corn contributed a short story to Unusual Suspects (1996), a paperback collection of original crime stories.[10]
His first and only novel, Deep Background (1999), is a conspiracy thriller about the assassination of a U.S. president at a White House press conference and the ensuing investigation. Reviews praised Corn's mastery of the political atmosphere and characters, although they split on whether this was a virtue or, coming towards the conclusion of Bill Clinton's term in office, already all-too-familiar territory. Reviewing the book in the New York Times, James Polk opined that although the book's included dramatic scenes such as a "seedy nightspot catering to homosexual marines, an interagency hit squad, a high-class look, but don't touch escort service", the novel could not deliver "enough shocks left to sustain the genre."[11][12]
With the arrival of George W. Bush, Corn became a harsh critic of the President. His next book, 2003's The Lies of George W. Bush: Mastering the Politics of Deception, alleged that Bush had systematically "mugged the truth" as a political strategy, and he found fault with the media for failing to report this effectively. The book also broke with journalistic practice for its explicit charge of lying, a word usually avoided as editorializing.[13][14] In particular, Corn criticized many of the arguments offered to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq; and he challenged New York Times columnist William Safire for claiming links between Saddam Hussein and Al-Qaeda.[15] In Hubris, written with Michael Isikoff of Newsweek, Corn analyzed the Bush administration's drive toward the invasion.[citation needed]
Corn announced on The Rachel Maddow Show on September 12, 2017 that he and Michael Isikoff were working on a new book about the Donald Trump campaign and administration's ties with Russia and the Russian hacking during the 2016 presidential campaign, as well as a history of Russian tactics.[citation needed] Their book was released on March 13, 2018 and entitled Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin's War on America and the Election of Donald Trump[citation needed]
The Plame affair[edit]
Main article: Plame affair
Corn was personally involved in the early coverage of the controversy over leaks to the media of the name of CIA officer Valerie Plame. After Robert Novak revealed Plame's identity in his July 14, 2003, column, Corn was among the first to report, several days later, that Plame had been working covertly;[16][17] He also raised the possibility that the leak of her identity violated the Intelligence Identities Protection Act (IIPA); however, prosecutors found no evidence that those government officials who leaked her name knew she was a covert agent, and no official was ultimately charged with violating the IIPA.[18]
Novak, for his part, disputed that Plame had been a covert operative at the time her identity was revealed. He also objected to the negative portrayal of himself in Hubris, the book in part about the matter by Corn nad Isikoff. Novak said of Corn, "Nobody was more responsible for bloating this episode." Novak felt that Corn was too close with former ambassador Joseph Wilson, Plame's husband and a key figure in criticism of the administration's arguments for invasion.[19] However, in early 2007, an unclassified summary of Valerie Plame's employment history at the CIA was disclosed for the first time in a court filing which confirmed that Plame was indeed a covert operative at the time Novak made her name public.[20]
Mitt Romney "47 Percent" video and George Polk Award[edit]
In announcing Corn's being awarded the George Polk Award for 2012, the sponsors wrote:David Corn of Mother Jones will receive the George Polk Award for Political Reporting ... Through persistent digging and careful negotiation with a source, Corn secured a full recording of Romney at a $50,000-a-plate Florida fundraiser declaring that 47 percent of Americans — those who back President Obama — are “victims” who are “dependent upon government” and “pay no income tax.” Corn worked for weeks to obtain the recording ... Furthermore, it was Corn’s extensive previous reporting on Romney that convinced the source to trust him with its release.[21]
David Corn's story that introduced the secret tape was published in Mother Jones on September 17, 2012.[22][23]
