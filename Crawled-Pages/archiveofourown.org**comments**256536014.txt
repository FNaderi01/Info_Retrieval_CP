        Err, yes, I haven't checked that email account for a while now. I'm glad you've completed your story, I hope everything worked out for you. I'm currently very busy with work so I don't have a lot of free time. I reckon closer to Christmas I'll have some free time so if you drop me a message then I'll read your final story.

        Two weeks before Christmas, I'll send it to you. Great to see you're doing well. I can't wait to talk to you about what I've been writing over the past six months.I've been doing wonderful, and I look forward hearing from you.
