    Summary
      Somewhere deep down, where echoes of the girl she used to be still lived, Arya knew it was unlikely they would survive what was to come. She knew even though she had finally gotten her home back, finally gotten  him  back, they were living on borrowed time. 
But sometimes, he made it easy to forget that simple, inescapable fact.

    Creator Chose Not To Use Archive WarningsBill Denbrough/Richie Tozier Bill Denbrough &amp; Richie TozierBill Denbrough Richie Tozier The Losers Club - mentionedyeah i know everyone is on the reddie hype train especially because of the new movie but like listen this is my personal otp You can pry this ship from my cold dead hands Fluff and Angst Alternate Universe - Canon Divergence Aged-Up Character(s) Alternate Universe - High School Swearing there is not enough decent material for this ship and its a dang shame
    Summary
      God, what was he doing? This was so stupid. It wasn’t going to change anything. He knew it wouldn’t. Bill was still going to leave, Richie was still going to leave, and they would probably never see each other again. He should just go back home, go to bed and pretend he hadn’t had the wild urge to confess his longest held secret to his best friend. But the deep ache in his chest at the thought of letting his feelings fade into memory kept his feet rooted to the concrete. So, he took a deep breath, ignored the hammering of his heart, and decided to stay.Bill was the author, but Richie had read so many of his stories that maybe he could be like the heroes he’d always envied that lived inside them. Maybe, for once, he could take control of his own narrative.

    Summary
      Samara Cousland was a woman of refined birth. She came from one of the oldest houses of Ferelden, and had been trained to be a perfect lady, and a perfect warrior. She was beautiful, in face and figure and personality, and her smile brought light to the dreariest of days. 
Morrigan was none of these things.
