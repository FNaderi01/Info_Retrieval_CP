    Summary
      Earth got used up. They got used up. So the nations of the world had to flee into the black...but they'll only ever be half alive now.America forgot how to smile at the academy...but maybe a day out planetside is all she needs. Hopefully the people on said planet won't try to burn her down. (A fusion-style crossover with fem!America and Canada from Hetalia in the Firefly universe, cast as Simon and River during the dance and witch scenes of the episode "Safe.")

    Summary
      The world is suffering, but don't worry, the Ancients have a plan. In order to be able to come down to Earth for good, Rome decides to kill twenty two birds with one stone and gather the nations in one room for an honest, down-to-earth confessional! The only problem is, it hinges on the most hated country in all of history: The Confederate States of America.  I'm bad at summaries, this will make more sense if you just read it...

    Summary
      Matthew loved the stars.They had always been there, and they always would. They had seen him thrive in his highest points and fall slowly, agonizingly, to his lowests. Empires had risen and fall as the stars stood silently over them like sentinels in the night, immortal in the depths of mankind's imagination. They were the keepers of long-forgotten secrets, of stories scarcely told.Matthew loved the stars because they were like him.Or:Matthew's been alive for more than a thousand years. He's seen far too much, died far too often, and yet he's still there.

    Summary
      A series of one shots documenting times when the My Hero Academia characters ran into Hetalia nations. There really are some strange quirks (and characters) out there. I do not own either anime, this is for fun! I drew the cover art and wrote the chapters, that's all.

    Summary
      Being a parent wasn’t on America’s to-do list. But it’s been centuries and his collection of little shits has grown. They’re still as cute and on crack as when he first got them. Hidden from the other nations America’s states go through celebrations and tragedies. From the Revolution to the Civil War to the World Wars, the family has supported each other no matter what happens (ignore the Civil War tho). So as we introduce each state, let’s witness shenanigans, love, and the inevitable revealing of the states to the nations. (I'll try my best to get the facts right and not make all the nations out of character. I don't own Hetalia, it should be obvious. The only thing I own is the state OCs and some other nation OCs. This story is on Wattpad and Ao3, both versions are written by me.)

    Summary
      "It is possible, yes?" Well, yes she supposed it was — "Then it's perfect!"No, there was nothing perfect about Germany being ordered to get pregnant through any means possible. Seeing Italy as the only way to do so, Germany must now find a way to seduce that idiot. With World War II still in full swing and tensions rising, she wonders how she'll ever pull through with this. Because perhaps not everything is how it seems. Kink meme fill, Italy/Fem!Germany. Starts out humorous but then turns darker with lots of eventual smut.

    Summary
      Warning this fic is very gay and has Top! England/Bottom!France and Smut and mpreg. Don't like it don't read. France and England have been together for years and as many couples, they had their share fair of breakups.The first one was during the revolution and French/Indian War, England/France pinning Canada against America. They both didn't like how the other pinned their babies against each other.The second one was cheating on him with China but doesn't blame Hong Kong for anything. He treats him like as he is one of his own children, he had most of England's kids, including Sealand(headcanon of mine). Most countries(with the exception of Prussia, Spain, the Italian Bros, Austria, and Greece) always assumed that France would cheat but he's the country of love and he wouldn't dream of cheating Arthur.After those breakups, Arthur wants to get back together with Francis but he has to prove to him that he truly loves him and heal the damage he caused with the help of their children, his brothers, and friends. Will, they finally get that happy ending or will it all downfall?

      America could see ghosts, but most of all he could see the man that stood before all men as they died. He could see the one who called himself death, but it was hard to believe that when the ever-so-like-Arthur man would correct his speech and comfort him when he was sick.

    Summary
      Pretentious title is pretentious.Romano lives in Italy, Antonio lives in Spain. They often have to part for months at a time due to meetings, world events, and other foreign relations that have to be maintained. Sometimes, the bed feels too cold without Antonio there, but when he visits, that lack of warmth grows into a red-hot fire that Romano doesn't want to escape from. (Also, very filthy smut in later chapters, but that's a given seeing that the two are both representations of the best lovers you can get.)

    Summary
      ‘First came Sealand, then America’s purge’Nations were supposed to reflect their people’s thoughts and ideals. They were made out of the needs of belonging and home, so when their people started slaughtering each other, they started to do the same.Where the tradition of the purge started in America got extended to the rest of the globe, allowing more nations to join in the event. This year the first purge in Finland is celebrated. On a unexpected turn of events, Sealand decides to stay for it. After him, England appears to try and protect the micronation from the violent acts occurring on the purge.----Original draft for this work that I made for the contest "Purga en el motin". I wrote this on english then translated it to spanish. First publicacion in spanish was made on Wattpad on the 9th of September 2020.My mother languaje is not english, i'm sorry for grammar and speech mistakes. Feel free to point them out so I can correct them.~AFC~

    Summary
      The UK Brothers struggle to gain any form of recognition at the World Conference due to Arthur's domineering nature. One by one, they discover a secret about being a Country that only a few at the Conference have experienced for themselves.It is the key to reconciling what Arthur has done in the past, and for them to learn to be their own shining light outside Arthur's ever-present shadow.Arthur doesn't know what's hit him until its literally on his doorstep, and he certainly isn't prepared to see how the brutal treatment of his brothers has changed them-in most cases-for the worse.Will he ever realize what he did wrong, and will he ever apologize?This is the formation of the Celtic Trio.
