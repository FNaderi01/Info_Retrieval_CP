            zach dempsey: dtf (smut)        Request: “Hey can I get a Zach Dempsey smut please! Lol”Pairing: Zach Dempsey x Reader Warning(s): Smutty. Word Count: 1,158Gif: @zachdempseyA/N: I wrote this at the pool with my parents. Appreciate this lol.Zach was over at your’s to study for the communications exam. Your parents were on a business trip, so you had the house to yourself.You and Zach, rather than study, took the empty opportunity to make out on your bed.His body laid atop yours, his thigh between your legs. You had your fingers entwined in his hair, keeping his lips close to yours. Your throat let out a moan when he pushed knee up to gain leverage, hitting the one spot you needed him most. He held your elbow and started to pull away. You pouted when your once warm lips met the cold air. He panted and pecked your nose. “Come back here,” you begged, cupping your hand to the nape of his neck. He shook his head. “I gotta go, (y/n). I’m babysitting my sister tonight.” He sat up on the bed, swinging his left to the edge. “Maybe tomorrow?”You groaned. Tonight was the only night your parents wouldn’t be home. You really wanted to take advantage of it. “But Zach,” you mumbled. You cuddled up to his back, your legs wrapping around his waist. “I want you to stay,” you whispered lowly into his ear. You kissed the area beneath his ear, his weakness. Your hands roamed his torso while you kissed down his neck. Zach let out a deep growl. His gripped your thighs, giving into you entirely. You unlatched yourself from him. He stood up to face you and you kneeled on the bed to gain some height. He cupped your chin, forcefully, but passionately kissing you. Your hands found their way up his t-shirt, your fingertips grazing over his muscles. He led you down on the bed, leaving a trail of kisses down your neck before his stood again. He took off his top, revealing his perfectly sculpted body. You bit the corner of your lip at the sight of him.He leaned toward you, connecting your lips once more. This time, his hand reached under your shirt. He grasped your bra, pulling the cup down. His course hands against your sensitive bud sent shivers down your spine. You moaned in his mouth, biting his lip. He helped you pull of your shirt.His mouth quickly attached to your chest, kissing the round tops of your breasts. You arched your back in pleasure, which gave Zach the access to unclasp your bra. You shimmied the straps down your arms and Zach threw the piece to the side. He attacked your neck forcing your chin up. His hands palmed your breasts, his knee pressed against your heat. Your hand covered your mouth- a frequent reflex- to muffle your moans. “Y/n, don’t try to be quiet,” Zach begged. “I need to hear you.”You bit your lip, embarrassed. He tugged the top of your jeans, unbuttoning them to slip off. He stood to take off your pants. You gladly helped him by pulling your legs out. You sat up,  toying with the straps on his pants.You cupped his bulge causing his eyes to close. He let out groggy whispers, cursing your name. You slowly pulled his pants down, taking in your time to witness his anxious pleasure. You tugged at the waistband of his boxers, kissing his v-line. When you pulled down his waistband, his hard on pulsed in the cold air. He shivered, begging you to do something.You kissed his swollen tip, shallowly taking him into your mouth. He let out a throaty groan, grasping your hair in a knot.“Deeper, babe,” he groaned. “Deeper.”You did as he asked. His tip reached the back of your throat, which caused him to twitch. You found a steady, yet fast pace. His eyes were screwed shut, his mouth gaped open. The moans echoed off the walls. “Fuck!” He growled. You knew he was getting close. “Stop, babe. Not here.” You saw the pain in his eyes when he pushed you away.You pulled away, slightly confused.“Lay back,” he ordered. He was trying to prevent his high. He propped your legs up, spreading them to get access to you. He kissed your center, already feeling your dampness. You exhaled sharply when he licked up the middle.“Zach,” you whispered. “Please.”He slipped your undies down your legs leaving you bare. He spread your legs again, kissing down your thighs. He took his time to build up anticipation. He kissed your lips, allowing his tongue to slip between your folds. You gripped his hair, cursing his name.His hands wrapped around your thighs, keeping your body from squirming around. Your head dug into the bed as you let your moans echo. Zach slipped a finger within you, causing your back to arch. You begged him for more, feeling your toes curl.He left you thighs, letting his swollen lips meet your hungry once. He put his finger in your mouth, which you gladly sucked on.He positioned himself between your legs. He teased your slit with his tip. You wiggled around, causing him to giggle.“Sit still, babe,” Zach panted.He thrusted into you slowly, but still causing you to gasp. He was only half in before he pulled back out. He dove in once more, letting his entire length into you. You groaned into your arm.He pumped himself a few times before leaning over you. He propped himself up on his forearms, right beside your face. He kissed you, letting your tongue into his mouth. He huffed as he thrusted. “Zach,” you moaned. Your nails dug into his shoulder. He buried his face in your neck. His grunts and groans were loud in your ear. His pace was slow, but hard and deep. Your throat only allowed you breath heavily. Zach pulled himself up, leaning on his hands to get a higher angle. You gripped his forearms, leaning your head back. He found a steady pace that hit your g-spot perfectly.He used his thumb to massage your clit, sending vibrations up your back. Your nails scratched his biceps, embracing every sensation you felt. You called his name, making him ware that you were about to come. He continued his thrusts till you arched your back, releasing your pleasures onto him. He bit his lip as you rode out your high on him. He pulled out and you took him into your hand. You pumped his hard on over your stomach.“Fuck, y/n,” he grunted. He let out groans of pleasure when he came on your torso. He pulsed in your hand, letting his high down. You sat up, and pulled him down for a kiss. He panted as you pulled away. “You should probably go,” you said sadly. Zach looked at you, taking in the sight of his beautiful and exhausted girlfriend. “My sister’s bed time is nine, and she’s a heavy sleeper. You want to come over?”You bit your lip, debating the idea. “Sure, why not?”

            jealous + jeff atkins        plot : y/n is jeff’s secret girlfriend but she gets jealous when other girls talk to him and has to show everyone/and him, who’s he is word count : 1270notes : jealous!reader++++Walking into school, your eyes searched for someone in particular.  You found him with his friends, leaning again his locker surrounded by his usual group of friends. He caught your eye, quickly looking away but a smile burst onto his face. You strode past him, moving to your own group of friends. You could feel a pair of eyes on you and you knew who they belonged to. “Hey, Y/N’s here!” your best friend, Kat hollered. Your other friends all turned and smiled at you. You returned it, but furrowed your eyebrows. They were acting odd.“We have news” one of your other friends chorused.“We think Jeff might be into you. You know the one on the baseball team? Hot Jeff?” another blurted. You were stunned for a mere second before you regained your composure and laughed. “Guys, there is no way Jeff Atkins is into me” you glanced at Kat, with a sly smile on your face. Kat was the only one of your friends that knew about you and Jeff’s relationship. Kat tried to hide her smug smile, “He’s been looking at for the past few weeks and you should’ve seen how he smiled when you walked in this morning” You smacked her on the arm for feeding into this gossip and she put her hands up in surrender. “Well, I guess I’ll have to do something about that then” you winked at them playfully, making all of your friends laugh, unaware of the truth.“Oh, better act fast then because, Tracy’s on the same mission” You turned around to see a girl leaning against his locker. They were laughing about something. She was pretty, prettier than you in your opinion. You trusted Jeff, you knew he wouldn’t do anything to hurt you but you couldn’t help the overwhelming feeling of envy as you watched him openly laugh with that girl. You two had agreed to keep your relationship a secret until he got his grades up since his parents thought a relationship would distract him. But seeing him talk to that girl so freely, laughing and joking, you realized that could’ve been you instead. But you were used to this feeling so you brushed it off. “No but Tracy and Jeff would be kinda cute, I mean they’ve been working on a chemistry project together for the past weeks and they’re adorable in class” one of the girls in your circle, thought out loud. “Have they now?” you muttered. “Yeah and I reckon they would be a pretty good couple” You glared in their direction, “I bet”+“Hey Y/N, so I have this chem- ” Jeff yelped as you 
pulled him into your room by the front of his shirt, swiftly shutting the door 
behind you with your foot. You pushed him into the wall next to the 
door, pressing your body to his, trapping him between you and the wall. Jeff’s eyes widened at your position, 
looking at you questioningly with big eyes.  “Y-Y/N what’s going on?” You didn’t reply verbally, simply
 pressing your lips to his instead. He instantly reacted to the kiss, 
moving his hands to your waist, squeezing gently. You let your hand rest
 on the back of his neck while another sat on his shoulder. He mumbled something incoherent and you ignored it. You shoved 
your tongue into his mouth, but he pulled away as soon as you did. “What’s up though?” he whispered, leaning his head back onto the wall.  You dodged the question, answering with another question.“You’re okay with this aren’t you?” you responded. “Well yeah of course…” Jeff stopped for a second, gathering his words but you had already taken that opportunity. You
 untangled yourself from him and lifted his shirt over his head, You smiled slyly at the sight of his bare body. You couldn’t help but smash your lips back onto his. He accepted you for a few heavenly 
seconds before pulling away again. “No seriously, what’s going on?” Jeff asked, worry in his eyes. “Does it matter?” you panted, looking up into his eyes, getting restless.  “It does, I don’t want my girl- oh my god” You had attacked his 
neck with kisses, sucking a bit longer than necessary with each. You ran
 your hand up the dips of his toned abs, getting a groan in return. You moved up to his jaw, pecking his lips before making a path down again. You hit just the right place, near the crook of his neck, 
making Jeff moan in response. “Y/N” You smirked at this, 
trailing your hand down to his belt buckle. You pulled him closer to you
 but before you could proceed to undoing it, Jeff pulled away for the 
third time. “I’m serious, what’s going on with you? You’re not like this normally…” he muttered, breathlessly. You
 took a deep breath, you didn’t want to tell him the real reason you 
were all fired up. You hated being the typical jealous girlfriend.  At 
your silence, Jeff spoke again. “Don’t get me wrong, it’s super hot but I just want to know if there’s anything wrong and I want to help if there is” He
 tucked a piece of hair behind your ear, looking at you with those 
concerned eyes. Those adorable eyes that you fell in love with. Jeff was so different from the other jocks that he called his friends. A normal guy wouldn’t have questioned this but Jeff, being Jeff, was always thinking about your well being. “I got jealous” you muttered. You knew from the surprised look on his face that he heard you. You never really got jealous. Girls always flirted with him and you didn’t blame them.“What was that?"he asked with a cheeky grin. That little- "I got freaking jealous okay?!” And then he burst out laughing. The nerve of him. You looked away, anger bubbling in you. “Of who?” he got out in between fits of laughter. “That girl you’re doing the chemistry thing with” You finally looked back into his amused eyes.“Worried that we had chemistry?” You
 slapped his chest at the terrible pun. That’s when you finally noticed 
the red and purple marks all over his neck and collarbone. It was your 
turn to laugh now. “Well I won’t have to worry anymore” you smirked. He
 eyed you suspiciously before following your gaze. You watched as his 
eyes widened dramatically and he looked to you like a gaping fish. “Y/N,
 how the hell am I meant to cover this up? Everyone will notice!”"Perfect” BONUS“Jeff, man it’s like 500 degrees out, take that scarf off” Jess groaned. “Uh, no I’m okay” Jeff replied awkwardly. “Well, I’m getting sick of it” Marcus stated, ripping it off Jeff’s neck before he could protest’The whole group silenced. Why did Jeff have to wear a v-neck today? “Oh look who got some last night” Bryce cheered. “Aww, look at our little Jeffrey growing up. I thought you didn’t do one time things” Justin teased. Jeff had turned a bright shade of red. “Damn dude, do we know the girl? Because she’s pretty hardcore” Monty chuckled, eyeing the marks that covered a large portion of his neck and shoulder. Jeff took a deep breath, playfully glaring at you from across courtyard. You caught his gaze, laughing and winked at him. God, he loved you.

            zach dempsey: lucky charm        Pairing: Zach Dempsey x readerWarning(s): Really freaking cute Zach DempseyWord Count: 299Gif: @joeckA/N: I really love @joeck, please go follow them!It was 5:46 and you just arrived at school. Your mom works early and you don’t drive, so you have to leave early too. Every morning you hear the dribble of a basketball in the gym. You usually just play your music and leave it be, but today, you were intrigued. Who was playing basketball at 6:00 in the morning?You peeked through the door space. You couldn’t see much of the figure, other than sporatic flashes of the baby blue jersey. You crept into the gym, revealing the school basketball star Zach Dempsey. You closed the door behind you as quietly as possible. You stood by the bleachers, watching him dribble the ball. He jumped up and aimed the ball at the basket. He missed the basket entirely.“Dammit!” He swore. He chased the ball to the gym wall. With the ball between him and the wall, he rested his head against it. He fist pounded against the mats.He turned around and dribbled the ball across the court. He jumped up, threw the ball and it hit the backboard. Luckily, it bounced into the basket. You smiled to yourself and physically celebrated the shot. You were sure not to make a noise.He continued playing, making all his shots. He jumped onto the basket, making a slam dunk. He let out a hearty laugh. You clapped you hands, which gained his attention. You paused. “I hope you don’t mind,” you started. “I heard the dribbling. I just wanted to see who was up.”He walked to the edge of the court with the ball against his side. Panting, he asked, “How long were you standing there?”He wasn’t upset that you were there, not even bothered.“Well,” you checked your phone for the time: 6:13. “Almost half an hour.”He smiled. “Did you see me missing all my shots?”You stepped out from beside the bleachers. “I saw one. Then you got back up and made the shots after.”He walked over to the bleachers, sitting beside where you stood. He tapped the spot beside him, beckoning you to sit. You did so and he wiped his sweat from his forehead on the collar of his jersey.“Y'know, before you got here,” he panted. “I couldn’t make any shots. Maybe one out of, lemme see, fifteen. Then the moment I was about to shower and give up, I felt completely at ease. Like, an extra rush of adrenaline.”You nodded, not really looking at him. You always found him attractive. He was a sweet guy– dumb, but sweet.“It’s like you’re my lucky charm,” Zach smiled.

            sad boy + justin foley        plot : after his mum’s new boyfriend kicks him out, Justin only has one thing to do word count : 1403notes : for two people who wanted Justin Foley but I forgot their accounts so I’m sorry for not tagging+++Running out of his house, bag slung over his shoulder, Justin wiped his wet eyes on the sleeve of his varsity jacket, only for the tears to be replaced with new ones. He didn’t stop until he couldn’t run anymore, legs aching, throat burning. He had no idea where he was, he couldn’t tell with his blurry vision. It was almost nightfall, not a person In sight. He fell to his knees, bag dropping with a loud thump, as a quiet sob passed his lips. There was one thing Justin could think of doing. One person he wanted to talk to now, he needed to talk to right now. He reached into his pocket, hands trembling as he did so, retrieving his phone. He somehow found your contact, a picture of your beaming face on his screen, the image alone calming him down the tiniest bit. He shakily pressed the dial button, holding his breath while waiting for you to pick up. Begging you to answer. One ring. Two ring. More tears gathered in his eyes.Three ring. You were probably busy. You didn’t need him as a burden. Four ring. More and more tears fell as another sob racked his body. “Hey” The world stopped. Justin’s voice was caught in his throat, no words forming. “Justin? You there?” He couldn’t help the cry he let out of his mouth. “Justin?! Are you okay?” The sound of your panicked voice, filled Justin’s heart. You cared, you were the only one who cared. “Y-Y/N” It was only a whisper, something you shouldn’t have caught but you did. “Justin? What happened? What’s wrong? What did they do?” “I- I can’t. I-” The words wouldn’t come out, as much as Justin tried. “Where are you? I’m coming to pick you up” you stated.Justin heard the jingling of keys through the phone. “I- I don’t know. There’s houses and- and a-” he stuttered, trying to speak through the suffocation he was feeling. “Justin. Stop. Breathe in. Breathe out. Now tell me, can you see a street sign anywhere?” He did as you instructed, following your smooth, familiar voice. “Risely Avenue” he said after a while. “Stay where you are, I’m coming. And Justin?” He blinked back more tears as he listened to you talk. “Yeah?” “Everything will be okay” It was a mere 10 minutes before your familiar car drove up the street, headlights illuminating the otherwise dark road. Justin looked at the ground as he stood, ashamed to look at you in his current state. He heard the click of the car door opening, followed the by the clicking of your shoes on the gravel road. He managed to look up, eyes meeting with your warm ones. You stood right in front of him, inches away. You held your arms out and in less than a second, Justin fell into your arms. “Hey” He swallowed hard, trying to get rid of the lump in his throat. “Hey” he replied, his voice a tiny squeak. You pulled away, much to Justin’s dismay. You picked up his bag from the floor and he didn’t have the energy to protest, taking his hand in yours, you walked back to your car, settling them in. And then you drove. “Y/N” You turned to look at your boyfriend of more than a year for a second before fixing your eyes back on the road. “I- uhm I-” “You don’t have to explain Justin. Not now anyway” You pressed your lips together, gently placing a hand on his knee while keeping the other on the steering wheel. He flinched at the sudden contact, but your hand stayed where it was. “I’m sorry, I just I-” He immediately started to apologise, even though you thought nothing of it and completely understood. “Sh, Justin. Just relax, you’re with me now” you assured, running a thumb across his jean clad knee.He nodded, swallowing thickly, shutting his eyes and focusing on your soft touch. You flicked your eyes to him, watching his long eyelashes fall on his cheekbones. His eyes were red and puffy from crying, dried tears on his cheeks. Soon enough, you reached your house, parking the car in the driveway. Justin opened his eyes, blinking a few times. You silently hopped out, grabbing his bag from the backseat before opening the passenger door. “You don’t have to do all this” Justin mumbled. “Come on” you urged, ignoring his statement. The two of you walked into your house, the warmth engulfing you both. You took his hand in yours, leading him to the spare bedroom.  “Have you eaten yet?” you questioned. Justin shook his head, like you expected. “Well, you know where the showers are, I’m going to heat up dinner okay?” He nodded, looking at the floor. You could tell he was on the verge of another round of tears. You frowned, walking up to him and wearing your arms around his neck, placing a kiss on his cheek. You felt him smile, even if it was a small one. You stepped away, smiling at him softly, before leaving the room. You walked to your kitchen, getting the leftovers from Robert out to heat them up. Nobody should be treated how Justin is. Justin didn’t call you about this, usually going to Bryce’s house or Alex’s but not yours. He never wanted to bother you with his problems, thinking he would be a burden to you. It took Justin almost a year before he even told you about his condition at home and that was only after Zach accidentally mentioned it. You took the food out of the microwave, placing it on the dinner table while waiting for him to arrive. Your parents were big business people, meaning they were out of town a lot of the time, so they bought you your own little house to stay in which they occasionally visited. Ten minutes later, the sound of water running stopped, meaning Justin was out of the shower. Another ten minutes later, Justin padded into the dining room, where you were waiting for him. His hair was dripping wet, droplets trailing down the back of his neck. His eyes were redder, even puffier while his bottom lip quivered. What you noticed now was the significant bruises that had formed around his neck and the sight of all of this made you shatter a little on the inside. He tugged at his sleeves, still looking at the floor. He had changed into a pair of sweats and a t shirt. You went to him, pressing a slight kiss on his shaking lips. You gripped his jaw with a feather-like touch, tilting it upwards to expose the purple and blue skin of his neck. You gingerly touched the large bruises that were vaguely in the shape of fingerprints. He gulped, Adam’s apple bobbing under your thumb. You sighed and pulled away.“Sit, Justin” He listened to your words, taking a seat next to you. He picked up his fork, staring at his food with no intention of eating it. “I’m not that hungry right now Y/N, I’m sorry for making you go to all this trouble-” “It’s fine Justin, I understand. Want to go to bed?” you offered.He nodded, standing up from the table with you following suit. You put his plate back in the fridge before taking his hand and walking back to bed. You got in first, opening your arms and inviting him to lay with you. He complied immediately, putting his head on your shoulder, intertwining your legs. “You have to report them Justin. Those bruises… they look bad. It’s the worse it’s gotten so far” you gulped, your own heart becoming heavy with the thought. “I can’t Y/N, I’ll be shipped off to some foster home with people I don’t even know and I might even have to move away. I’m not risking that” You nodded, it was a hard decision for anyone. “How are you feeling?” “Fine” As the words left his mouth, you felt wetness on your shoulder. “Oh Justin, you don’t need to act strong now. It’s okay to be human” you whispered into his ear. And those were all it took before he broke down for the third time that evening. His body shook violently as you held him tight. “It’ll all be okay Justin. I promise”
And in that moment, Justin realised that the only real place he felt safe was with you.

            jeff atkins: skittles        Request: “please write more jeff atkins imagines”Pairing: Jeff Atkins x ReaderWarning(s): NoneWord Count: 373Gif: @titch-the-eskibro-banditA/N: Fair amount of my own headcannons. If you want to hear some of my headcannons, lemme know! [ Read pt 1 ] [ Read pt 2 ]It was Friday night. Jeff had picked you up from your house and cruised over to the Crestmont. He played his country music, mocking the deep accents. You had the window rolled down, your hair blowing in your face.Once you arrived, Jeff had bought tickets to the new thriller in town. You linked your arm to his, feeling his warmth.“Hey Clay,” Jeff fist bumped your brother. “She’s here, safe and sound.”Clay shook his head. He got the movie packet together, which consisted of two medium sodas, a large popcorn, red vines and-“Skittles?” Jeff looked at Clay. “I thought it was just red vines?”“Well, yeah,” Clay shrugged. “But y/n likes skittles. I won’t charge for that.”You gave your brother a small smile. “Thanks Clay.”“Of course,” he nodded. “Enjoy your movie.”Jeff held the large box in one arm, and even though he struggled, he still took your hand. Once you settled down in the middle of the theater, you ripped open the bag of skittles.You poured a few into your hand. You motioned your handful to Jeff.“You want?” You offered. Jeff chuckled, taking a few colors. He dropped them in all at once. Once he swallowed his sweets, he turned to face you.“What’s your least favorite skittles flavor?” He asked, not minding his volume at all.You widened your eyes at him. You folded your lips into your mouth. When he wouldn’t look away, you whispered to him your answer. He nodded, and took the bag of skittles. He took out all the colors that you claimed were not in your palate.You furrowed your brows. “What are you doing?” You whispered. His smirked, holding the solid color in his hand.“I’m getting rid of what you don’t like,” Jeff announced. He tossed the number of skittles in his mouth, squinting his eyes. “Apparently, I don’t like them either…” He coughed.You laughed into your hand, muffling your giggles. Jeff got to the point where he had to swallow the sugary treat. He sipped his cola, clearing his throat.“I will get rid of anything you don’t like, Y/N,” Jeff spoke, his voice raspy. “Unless I hate it too, then it’s up to Clay.”

            Thighs - Jeff Atkins smut        Summary : “Jeff’s seen your thighs okay. And words can’t describe how much he wants them wrapped around his head.” Basically, Jeff eating you out.  I got this idea from @tevinter-winter, so the credit goes to them for that! Check out the post I got the plot from.Pairing : Jeff Atkins x readerWarnings : Oral sexWords count : 1,428A/N : Sorry it took so long for me to post it! I had some troubles writing the end, it kinda sucks. Also, this is so long, I didn’t paid attention to the length before the end. I haven’t wrote a full smut in a while so let me know what’s wrong with it so I could make it better next time!I was laying on the couch, my legs over Jeff’s lap. We were at his house, his parents being away until tomorrow morning. The both of us were watching some movie on Netflix Jeff wanted to see, but I wasn’t really into it. I’ve been on my phone for the past half hour.Jeff was so into the movie, he wasn’t really paying attention. His hands were resting on my thigh, his thumb stroking my skin lightly. I was getting inconfortable in my position and too far from Jeff as my linking, so I moved my legs a bit, this way I could cuddle up to his side. He looked down at me as he wrapped his arms around my shoulders, smiling and then kissing my forehead before focusing back on the screen in front of him.I started to get really bored. I didn’t wanted to distract my boyfriend from his movie, as he was really enjoying it. I innocently started playing with the aim of his shirt, rolling it between my fingers, rubbing the fabric against them. I could feel the end of the movie was near, as the characters were all finding solutions to whatever situation they had going on. My free hand slid up Jeff’s side before finding his hair and playing with it, nuzzling my face into his neck.Suddenly, his hand moved up behind my thigh and massaged my skin, some other times grabbing it. I would lie if I said it didn’t had its effect on me. I let out a soft moan against the skin of his neck as he grabbed my butt without warning. I hear him chuckle at my reaction which leads me to straighten.“What are you doing ?” I asked smiling at him, only waiting for him to answer so I could kiss him.“I just love your thighs.” He eyed to them, massaging them again. “They’re so soft.” I putted my legs on each side of him so I could face him properly.“Oh, yeah ?” He nodded in respond as my face was getting closer to his, and finally our lips connected. There started the battle between our tongues, dancing in sync, with moans escaping our mouths. I pulled away for air just a second and then slowly kissed my way down his jaw, onto his neck. “Tell me more.”Jeff moaned louder as I was sucking on his neck, determined to leave a purple mark here. “I want them-” His sentence was cut short by another moan. My core grinning on his bulge, that was getting harder with every movement I made. “Fuck- I just want to put my head between them.”I internally froze at his words. Jeff and I were dating for a few months  and everything was amazing, but he had never eaten me out before. Not that I didn’t wanted to, oh how I wanted it, I just didn’t know how to bring it up.“Today’s your chance then.” Our lips were back together with a heated kiss.His hands went to my waists to help me lay down on the couch. The kiss was broken for a few seconds and he took this opportunity to attack my neck, just like I did with his a few moments before. Moans were flying out of my mouth with his hands cupping me through my shirt? I wasn’t wearing any bra under his large tshirt I had on, and he took advantage of it, sliding one hand to touch my bare skin, the other resting on my waist. He was turning me on so much. The sens of him brushing on top of my skin made me shiver, my body letting him know by tensing up underneath him followed by a louder moan escaping my lips, which caught his attention. He began to be rougher in his touch, biting my neck where he had leaved his mark while rubbing it with his tongue. I was getting impatient, feeling the hot heat between my legs burning harder with every move he made at the surface of my body.“Jeff, please touch me.” I was so needy at this moment, needy of his tongue, his fingers, of everything he could give me.“Anything, princess.” His kisses stopped and for a second it felt so empty not to have him against me.He placed a lazy kiss on my lips before removing my shirt, exposing my breast to his sight. In no time, he had my left nipple in his mouth, sucking on it, massaging the other. His adorable eyes looked up to me innocently, just to witness how it got me out of my mind? He loved it, the effect he’s got on me. Seeing his abilities to make me scream for him. He didn’t waste much time after it, bringing down his hand to where I needed him the most. It only took the light contact of his hands, hovering my core to get me crying out for more friction. I started to roll my hips over his fingers, hungry for more of him.“Someone’s eager.” He laughed while releasing my nipple with a ‘pop’, noticing my impatient behavior.“I just need you.” As I stated my desire, my panties were slowly  being dragged down down legs, the fabric brushing against my skin causing me to shiver in anticipation.Jeff pushed my legs apart, laying down between them, just in font of my dripping core. Looking down at him, my breath got caught in my lungs when I saw the lust in his gaze. My bottom lips was stuck between my teeth, languidly waiting for the tension to break down, those seconds seeming like forever to me. Suddenly, I could feel the warm of his tongue, delving into my folds, leading to a high-pitched moan filling the room and echoing in my ears. I could feel him lapping every corners he explored, licking all the juices coming out the second he went in contact with it.My head collapsed against the armrest, eyes closed, picturing the work of my boyfriend between my legs. My mouth was parted open, allowing the air to pass, and also a collection of scream. I felt his fingers parting my folds just to push one in? I cried out at the mixed sensation between my legs, almost covering my mouth by how loud I was screaming.“Oh my god, keep doing it.” I pleaded to him.My hands went down to grab his hair, tangling on it so hard I thought I was hurting him. But that only made him moan against me, sending vibrations through my whole body. My back was arching, Jeff pushing it back down to keep me still. His hand rested on my hip, one of my mine leaving his hair to place it on top of his. He immediately moved it so our fingers will intertwined, another tender touch connecting us. As he added another finger in, my legs began to shake around his head, tightening around it and I started to see stars behind my eyelids. Electricity waves were send in my stomach making me gaps in pleasure, as I was falling apart under Jeff’s actions. Our hands unlocked and I was back at pulling his hair again. He had to keep me still and did it by wrapping both of his muscled arms around my thighs, this way I couldn’t make a move to disturb him anymore. He kept lapping on the surface of my core and every time the knot on my stomach was getting bigger.“Jeff, I’m- I’m gonna cum.” I murmured between breaths.He took note of it and dragged me closer to him, making me scream even more. I felt his fingers picking up the pace inside me, and it only took that for my toes to start curling up, my legs shaking harder than before. I was embracing my release, feeling it was just on the edge. Just as I let a loud moan escape my mouth, my high send vibes all over my body, tensing up. Jeff didn’t stop until I moaned softly, letting him know I came down from my release. His head popped up on top of me and he laid it on my stomach, kissing it.“Thank you.” Was all I said, out of breath. I stroked his hair slightly, closing my eyes.“You’re welcome, babe.” He laughed gently at my words, which made me laugh too, just before his head came to my height and kissed me with love.

            zach dempsey: can i kiss you?        Request: “I want a zach dempsey x reader one. Fluffy, and I want them to kiss.”Pairing: Zach Dempsey x ReaderWarning(s): Fluffy and cute.Word Count: 632Gif: @joeck (Gee, no surprise.)A/N: I didn’t really know where I was going, so bear with me.“No, Zach, it’s not rocket science,” you exhale. “It’s just biology.”You had the glorious opportunity to tutor the great Zach Dempsey. Yes, he’s attractive and ambitious, but he’s also incredibly thick.Zach dropped his pen on the table and leaned back. He let a sigh escape his lips; which moved the piece of hair that laid upon his forehead. You hung your head on your shoulder, watching him close his eyes. You wouldn’t be telling the truth if you said you weren’t attracted to Zach Dempsey. Tutoring Zach Dempsey isn’t the hardest job in the word, but it also ain’t the easiest. You couldn’t understand it- he was always getting good remarks in biology. But spending an extra hour with the heartthrob of Liberty was definitely worth it. “So, what exactly do the nonkinetochores do?” You asked, trying to focus him back on the worksheet.He sighed once more, moving the paper into his sight. “Uh, they elongate the cell for replication.”You nodded, acknowledging his correct answer. “And why the cell elongates, it starts to…?”“Create cell cleavage?” He questioned. You smiled and he took that as a result of getting the right answer. 
“See, you understand,” you chuckled. You checked your phone for the time: 3:45. “And right on time. We gotta go.”You both packed up and left the library. It was raining heavily, which you did not expect as you had not coat or jacket. Zach took off his varsity jacket and wrapped it around you when he saw you rub your biceps.“Do you want me to drive you home?” Zach asked. His car was across the lot.“Uh,” you paused. You checked your phone and saw that your dad couldn’t pick you up. “Please?”He grinned and nodded. “No problem.”Zach took his jacket off your shoulders and held it above your head. You two started speed walking to his car. When you were walking, Zach dropped his binder. You stopped to pick it up, but so did Zach. You both had turned into each other. “Oh,” you exhaled. You were not soaking wet from the rain.You looked up at Zach as he looked down at you. The water dripped off his forehead to his nose, then down to his lips. His mouth was slightly parted, which explained his heavy breathing.He gentle moved a string of wet hair from the front of your face. He left his hand to hold the side of your head. “Can I,” he breathed. “Can I kiss you?”The corners of your lips curved up and your cheeks became rosy. Zach imitated the features.“Please,” you whispered.Without hesitation, Zach leaned forward. You pressed your hands against his chest to stabilize yourself to tippy toe higher. You felt his lips hover over your bottom. He nibbled slightly and pulled away.You gripped the collar of his shirt and pulled him back for another kiss. You felt his smile form when he wrapped his arms around your waist. You released your grip to connect your hands about the crook of his neck. His tongue slipped into your mouth, forcing him to crouch slightly to get a better angle. You sighed in the comfortable position. You pulled away, keeping your eyes closed.“Get out of the rain! You’ll get sick!” the custodian shouted from the library.Zach snapped his head to the man, then tilted his head. He picked up his binder then took your hand. Together, you both walked over to his car.“Let’s get you home.” Zach opened your car door, letting you in first. He jumped into the driver’s seat.With one hand on the steering wheel and the other in your hand, he drove out of the lot.“Tutoring got all the more interesting,” Zach laughed.

            A Soft Spot (Montgomery De La Cruz, 13 Reasons)        There was an annual scavenger hunt that took place every year at a local park in your town. You’d gone every year in your childhood, and it was now your turn to take your three year old niece. You’d convinced your boyfriend, Montgomery De La Cruz to go with you. He didn’t want to go necessarily, but he had a self admitted soft spot for not only you, but young kids. “Zach is taking his little sister, and Bryce is taking his little cousin. I said we could meet up with them.” He grabbed your hand. Your niece sat comfortably on his shoulders. She loved Montgomery. Or “Monty” as she called him after hearing you call him that quite a bit. “That’s fine. Where are they though?” Montgomery gestured to an area a few yards away. Sure enough, there his friends stood. Bryce stood with a young boy who couldn’t be older than five, while Zach stood with his sister who was a few years older than that. “I told you I was too old for this, Zach!” His sister crossed her arms over her chest, she looked embarrassed. “Oh yeah? Stop acting like you’re two.” Zach said in a kidding tone, bringing her into his chest for a hug. This seemed to lighten her up, though she still rolled her eyes and pushed him away. “Let’s go Monty.” Your niece jerked his head towards the sign in table. “You’re letting a little girl order you around?” Bryce laughed. You sent daggers his way. He knew this was your niece. You two didn’t like each other, plain and simple. “We came here to do a fucking scavenger hunt, we’re doing a fucking scavenger hunt.” Montgomery rolled his eyes at Bryce. They were friends, but not so much after you two had started dating. “Language, Montgomery.” You said quietly and sternly. You didn’t need your niece running home and dropping F bombs after hanging out with you and your boyfriend. “She has you by the balls, doesn’t she?” Bryce nodded in your direction. Monty looked like he wanted to lunge at him, but you simply grabbed his bicep and led him to walk in the opposite direction. “You’ve worked so hard not be such a hot head, you can’t let someone like Bryce ruin this for you.” Montgomery mumbled something before nodding in agreement. A few hours later, after finding a few things on the scavenger hunt’s list, you guys had reached the words “sea shell” “I see it! I see it Monty! Auntie!” She chanted on and on excitedly. Once you and Monty caught what she was looking at, you both turned to walk that way. “I want to get it.” She said quickly. Monty knelt down and let her off his shoulders. She trotted over to the shell. Just as she reached it, so did Bryce’s cousin. Luckily, your niece grabbed the shell first. She giggled happily, turning to walk back to the two of you. “That’s mine.” Bryce’s cousin said with little to no energy, taking it, and turning to walk away. Your niece was feisty, however, and she never went down without at least a little bit of a fight. “Give that back right now!” She demanded. She hopped up and down, as he held the white shell over his head. She finally yanked on his arm hard enough to where the shell went flying out of his hands. Before she could take off running for it, he shoved her to the ground and ran for it himself.“You little shit!” Monty didn’t take any hesitation before picking her up and handing her to you. He took the shell from the little boy. “What makes you think you can do that? Do you go around hitting girls a lot?” The little boy’s lip started to quiver before tears streamed down his pink cheeks.“Did I seriously just see you take that away from my little cousin, Monty?” Bryce approached. He didn’t look angry, just annoyed. “He stole it from her.” Monty said, shrugging and handing it to the little girl. “Woah, I’m gonna have to ask you to give that back to him, it’s his after all.” Bryce approached the little girl. You whipped around, shielding her from him. “Don’t come near my niece, Walker.” Your maternal instincts came out as you grew more protective of her by the second. “You’ll be handing that over.” Bryce said simply. Montgomery scoffed at the comment, as though it was an unbelievable idea. “Enough about the shell, who’s going to teach your cousin not to hit girls?” Montgomery approached Bryce. “I’ve never met someone who’s fought more people than you, Montgomery.” Bryce let out a loud laugh before staring right at Monty. “I may have knocked a lot of guys around, but never a girl.” Montgomery stated. He seemed to want to make that very clear to anyone and everyone who may have been listening. “You’re telling me you’ve never knocked miss priss around?” Bryce smirked, pointing at you. Suddenly, a growl escaped Montgomery’s lips. You’d never heard anything like it. “Absolutely-Fucking-Not.” And with that, Monty lunged at him. You didn’t stop him this time. Long story short, you all got kicked out and only Zach and his sister finished the hunt. That night, after dropping your niece off, you sat, visiting with her parents. “Did you need to eat dinner, baby?” Her mother asked her. The little girl shook her head. “Absolutely-Fucking-Not.” She said in a sing-song tone, before prancing down the hallway. You slowly looked at Monty, who was bright red and refusing to make eye contact with you, or anyone else for that matter. ~Don’t really know where this came from, but I hope it was enjoyable. Request guys :)~

            zach dempsey: wet t-shirt        Pairing: Zach Dempsey x ReaderWarning: Just sweet, cheeky Zach DempseyWord Count: 299Gif: @joeckAt Kat’s going away party, she introduced you and Hannah to the famous Justin Foley and charming Zach Dempsey. You knew of Justin and Zach, as they knew some about you. You had Zach in your marine science freshman year. He was top of the class, which aside from the stereotypes is remarkable.“Sorry boys, can’t have you in Hannah’s house soaking wet,” Kat denied.“C’mon, it’s not a party without us!” Zach stated. You caught Zach’s glance, but turned away from him. “Dry off,” Kat waved them off.You went out to the backyard, seeing Foley and Zach, still drenched, slurping out of red solos. “Imma change,” Zach stated. He faced you as he slid pass you. His faded cologne intoxicating you. His hand grasped yours and led you to a bathroom.He shut the door behind the two of you, pressing you against the door. His chest centimeters away from your face, you closed your eyes and took a breath.“I missed you,” you exhaled. A small chuckle escaped his throat.His hair tickled your cheek when you felt his lips meet your shoulder. “I missed you more.”You wrapped your arms behind his neck, holding him for a hug. To physically have him there meant the world to you. He held your short stature close to him, taking in everything about you. Your skin, your scent, your hair- all of you.His arms stayed around your waist. Not falling below, not creeping higher. Just around your waist. He was always gentle with you and never pushed your limits. When you parted, you realized your shirt had become wet as well. You could vaguely, but surely see the lacy texture of your bra. You crossed your arms, covering yourself.“What is this?” Zach smirked. “A wet t-shirt contest?”

            The good jock - Scott Reed        Description: Scott finds out that your going to the Clubhouse and he wants to be there to make sure that nothing happens to you. Originally posted by steveharrigntonsScott was in the locker room changing his clothes after practise when a conversation caught his attention. “Y/N and Sheri were kinda flirty today so we invited them to the Clubhouse” said Montgomery to some other guy. “Hey Montgomery, mind if I go?” asked Scott.“Yeah you should came bro” replied Montgomery. Normally, Scott wouldn’t have gone there. He didn’t really like that place and the few times he’d been there, he’d end up leaving early. Besides, he had been avoiding some team bembers since the tapes were released. That was exactly why he didn’t want to leave you both alone with these guys, he didn’t trust them anymore. He was starting to think that maybe he should get away from these “friends” who he barely recognized and start making new ones. So, he had distanced himself a bit from the boys of the team. Not Zach, he still liked Zach. You and Sheri stepped into the Clubhouse with Montgomery guiding you. He had brought two other guys with him, one of them was Scott Reed. Clay thought he was the one leaving the polaroids, and you really hoped he was since you felt like he was the only good jock apart from Zach. The Clubhouse was exactly like you expected it to be from what you had seen on the polaroids. The minute you stepped in, you started to feel uncomfortalbe. The only reason you where there was to find out how to sneak in with Clay and Justin to steal the box with all the polaroids. “Take a seat ladies” said Montgomery.Sheri sat on the couch and so did you, with Scott Reed sitting by your side. Montgomery was lighting what seemed like a cigarette but it was surely filled up with some drug. The door opened and Bryce came into the room. That made you feel even worse, you were wishing he wouldn’t come. “Starting the party without me Monty?” asked Bryce. He took the joint from Montgomery’s hands and gave it to Sheri. “Wanna try it?” “I can’t, I have an exam” replied Sheri. “Just a little, we gotta have fun, right?” insisted Bryce. “Okay” Sheri took the joint and started to smoke. It wasn’t the first time she was doing it so it wouldn’t affect her that much but if you tried it…god knows what will hapenn, you had never done drugs before. “Your turn, Y/N” said Montgomery. “No, thanks. I’ve never done this”. “Well, there’s always a first time” said Bryce. “Yeah, c’mon. It’s okay.” “You’ll feel much better after you try it” said the guy you didn’t know. You were about to take the joint but Scott took your hand to stop you. “She doesn’t have to do it if she doesn’t want to” he said. You were honestly surprised that he was standing up for you. He was a good guy after all, you were right. “What the hell Reed? Don’t be such a wet blanket” said Montgomery. Scott looked angrily at him before standing up and holding your hand to make you stend up as well. “Wanna leave, Y/N?” he said, still looking at Montgomery and Bryce. You nodded and told Sheri to get up. Scott started to walk out still holding your hand. When you were finally outside you took a deep breath. For a moment you had thought they’d force you to get high and then…you didn’t even dare to imagine what would have happened then. “Thank you” you said, looking at Scott. It was in that moment that he realized that he was still holding your hand and let go of it blushing. “Why are you helping us?” asked Sheri, still not trusting the boy. “Look, just because I play baseball with them doesn’t mean I trust them” said Scott “I couldn’t let them to anything to you” continued him looking at you. Now it was your time to blush. Sheri looked at the both of you suspiciously. “Well, I do have to take a test so I better leave” said Sheri “I didn’t wanna interrupt anything anyways” whispered her winking at you as she walked away. Okay, maybe you had a little crush on Scott since freshman year and maybe Sheri had noticed it. “So, what class do you have now?” asked Scott. “Maths” you answered a bit confused, why would he want to know that? “Do you want me to walk you there?” said Scott shyly, looking at the floor as his hand ran through his hair in a nervous gesture. “I’d love that” you said smiling. He smiled back and you both started walking, with him reaching for your hand unconciously again. You loved how your hand fitted in his. Hope you liked it!

            dickhead || zach dempsey        prompt: Can you do a zach imagine where you guys are dating and you find out what he did to Hannahwarnings: swearinga/n: no sad ending dont worry , as always hope you enjoy, feedback is appreciated and requests are open also im gonna assume zach is a senior bc im not sure myselfZach didn’t intend for you to find out, he hoped he could’ve avoided the whole tape situation. You and Zach were in a happy relationship, having meeting him at the end of junior year. He at first came off as a dick and an idiot, just trying to impress his idiot friends. But once you got to know him, he was a sweetheart who wanted to be a marine biologist. You loved Zach Dempsey and he loved you too.You had your earbuds in listening to your playlist, and minding your own business. You were gonna meet your boyfriend Zach for lunch, and he was gonna take you out. Your peaceful walk was interrupted by an anxious Clay Jensen. “Hey Y/N.” Clay greeted you, you took out one earbud and gave him a smile. “Hi Clay.”“How do you do it?” He asked, and you looked at him in confusion. “How do I do what?” You asked as the two of you kept walking. “How can you still date Zach after what he has done?” Clay asked and you stopped walking. The thing was that you were aware of the tapes, as you heard Zach’s conversations with Justin, Marcus and others. You didn’t mean to listen, it was simply walking in on the wrong time. But you never knew who were on the tapes or what they did. So hearing Clay tell you this was some surprising news.“What did Zach do?” You asked slowly, not ready to hear what Clay was about to say. “I’m sorry Y/N, but Zach and Hannah had the same Communications class. And they were doing anonymous compliments, Zach had started taking Hannah’s compliments after she rejected him. Hannah had set up a trap and left a letter for Zach, which had very personal subjects. He found the letter and read it and Hannah said he threw it away. I really am sorry Y/N.” Clay explained and you couldn’t believe it.You were silent, you couldn’t process the new information and you started walking towards the school entrance, Clay followed behind and spoke repeated “I’m sorry Y/N.” But you shook it off, “It’s fine Clay. I know you meant no harm.” Then you left the school and saw Zach parked out front, waiting for you. Zach noticed something was off once you entered his car, you didn’t greet him as usual.Zach had drove to Rosie’s diner. You both entered and sat a booth and you sat across from Zach rather than next to him. You ordered your food and continued to sit in silence. “What’s wrong Y/N, you’re quiet. I miss your smile.” Zach asked, desperate to get a reaction from you. “Why the hell did you do it?” You asked, not look at him. “Why’d I do what?” He asked genuinely confused. “Why the hell would you do that Hannah? Even after knowing what had happened to her.” You asked, finally looking at Zach. “I don’t know why. I-I freaked out. I didn’t know she would react like that.” Zach shot back.“Did you really throw away the letter?” You asked after moments of silence, your food arriving at your table. “No, I never threw it away. She was lying about that. Well I don’t know what she saw but I never threw it away.” He said, taking out his wallet and showing you the letter. The letter was folded up and kinda  crumpled with ‘Zach’ written on top with Hannah’s handwriting. “I didn’t know she would react that way.” Zach said and you sighed, getting up and moving to sit next to Zach. “I hope you know I’m still mad at you. You’re kinda a dickhead for what you did.” You said in a matter of fact way. Zach laughed softly and moved his arm around your shoulder, pulling you closer to him.“I know I’m a dickhead. I regret what I did you know.” He spoke and you laughed. “Yeah but you’re my dickhead. I love you Zach Dempsey.” You said, pulling him into a kiss. “And I love you Y/N Y/L/N.” He said once the two of you pulled away.hope you enjoyed the imagine !!

            I missed you - Scott Reed Imagine (Part I)        “Could you write an imagine for Scott Reed where the reader is dating Scott, and Bryce starts making the reader uncomfortable (because he has been touching her and has even tried to kiss her) and she doesn’t want Scott to find out cause he is friends with Bryce so she ends things with him and later on Scott finds out why and he and Bryce get into a fight. Then afterwards, the reader and Scott get back together.” I ended up making two parts because it was too long. The second one will be posted in a few minutes (i’m honestly more excited about the second one bc it’s where all the cute stuff happens). Hope you enjoy it!

Originally posted by robbieamell“C’mon, don’t you wanna come to the clubhouse?” He grabbed your waist. You tried to pull away but Bryce wouldn’t let you go. “It’ll be fun, trust me” “I…I have some tutoring to do after class so…” You looked around the hall, there was no one there to help you and you didn’t know what to do. You had been avoiding Bryce ever since all these rumors about him raping Jessica started. He had tell everyone that he didn’t do anything, but you didn’t buy it. “Then come after that. I can wait.” Bryce looked at your lips for a while before getting closer to you.You dropped the books you were holding which made him pull away. You got down to pick them up and ran away with a quick “Can’t, bye”. It had been two
days since that moment and you hadn’t gone back to school, you were afraid of
facing him again. And you were afraid of seeing Scott. He’d send you several
texts, he called you a few times and he even came to your house. But you
pretended that you weren’t home. You just weren’t ready to see him; you weren’t
ready to tell him what you had decided to do. Scott was friends with Bryce so
you didn’t want him to find out but you couldn’t just be with him like nothing
had happened either. How would he react if you told him? If he got angry with
Bryce and did something then Bryce would go after him and he would make Scott’s
life impossible. You didn’t want that to happen. So you had reached a conclusion,
you had to break up with Scott.  But now you
were standing in the hall, back at Liberty High, and there was no way of hiding
from your boyfriend. He was walking his way down the hall to your locker. “Hey babe” he
said giving you a quick kiss “Are you okay? I haven’t heard from you in two
days, I was worried.” “Yeah, it’s
just uh…I needed some time for myself” “Why? Did
something happen?”“I don’t really
want to talk about it here, can we go outside?” He nodded and you started
walking towards the door. Scott tried to grab your hand like he used to do but
you didn’t let him. Once you were outside the school you started talking. “I
have been thinking a lot lately and I need us to be apart for a while. I…I can’t…”
You were on the verge of tears and the hurt look that you saw in his eyes made
it more difficult. “But what
happened? What did I do? Cause if I did something that could’ve hurt you I…”
You didn’t let him finish. Breaking his hurt was breaking yours and you couldn’t
be there anymore. “You didn’t do
anything. But I just need you to give some time. I can’t explain why you’ll
just have to trust me” With that being said, you walked away giving him no time
to give you an answer. A week had
gone by since you broke up with Scott and it had been really hard for you.
Seeing at school and having to ignore him was breaking your heart and it sure
was breaking his. You were starting to wonder if you had made a good choice,
maybe it’d be better if you just told him the truth. You felt kind of lost
without him and you really missed him. You were having
lunch with Jess and Alex with all the jocks sitting on the table next to yours.
You could basically hear their conversation which suddenly caught your
attention since you heard your name. “So what happened
with Y/N, Scott? We haven’t seen her around for a while now” asked Bryce. “We broke up”
said your ex-boyfriend in a sad tone that made your heart hurt. “No wonder you
did” answered Bryce almost laughing. “What do you mean?”
“I mean, she
didn’t even want to come to the clubhouse so…You should find yourself a funny
girl Reed” “What?! You
invited her there?! I told you I don’t like this place and I don’t think she’d
like it either” Oh no, Scott was starting to sound pissed off. “I just wanted
her to have some fun man, relax” “Yeah, with
you” whispered Montgomery laughing. But Scott was close enough to hear him. “Did you do
something to her” Scott asked angrily. “He couldn’t”
replied Montgomery again with Bryce giving him a killer look. “But you tried”
said Scott. “I mean, I may
have tried to kiss her but…” started to say Bryce.“You fucking
asshole” screamed Scott standing up to get closer to him. Before Bryce could
even react, Scott had already punched him in the face. “Wow wow man
what do you think you’re doing?” screamed Montgomery getting prepared to fight
Scott. “Giving that
piece of shit what he deserves” replied Scott hitting Bryce again and harder
this time. The whole
cafeteria was staring at them as Bryce and Montgomery fought back while some of
the other jocks tried to get in their way and stop the fight. But Scott wasn’t
going to stop either; he was determined to beat the crap out of Bryce. But he
was already bleeding and you weren’t willing to let him get even more hurt so
you got up to stop him at the same time the coach was arriving to stop the
fight. Part II coming soon.

            Baseball Lessons/ Jeff Atkins imagine        Baseball LessonsJeff Atkins x readerRequest: Can you do an imagine of Jeff and make it all fluffy? Can you put my name in it, it’s Paige btw💓 love you imaginesA/N: I’m overwhelmed by the reactions I’ve gotten from my first imagine. Thanks so much! My request box is still open J I tried to combine this one with the fencing request because I know more about baseball than fencing.Word count: 638“Jeff! I don’t know how to do this!” you screamed at him from the other end of the field while you bounced up and down, holding the baseball bat.“Of course you can!” Jeff screamed back, “Just…- wait. I’ll help you.”Jeff was teaching you some baseball or at least trying to. He created a game that just the two of you could play.He jogged towards where you stood and stood behind you. He grabbed your waist with both hands so you stood in a squad-like position. He encircled his arms around yours and held the baseball bat with you. Even though you had been dating for a few months now, it made you flustered.“Okay… look at the ball, turn your body a little bit like this…” he whispered in your ear and he moved your body like an artist would move his sculpture. “Just like that.”He let go of your body and you moved your arm to wipe the sweat off your forehead. Even though you hadn’t even played the actual sport yet, Jeff made you hot.He jogged back to his original place and put on his glove again. “Okay go for it, babe!” he screamed and got into position to catch the ball.You breathed out heavily and hit the ball with your bat. It wasn’t an impressive shot but you at least managed to hit the ball.“Okay good!” Jeff rolled the ball back to you and you picked it up and put it back on the tee.“Now try to run to a base after you’ve hit the ball, Y/N,” he said and got into position again.You nodded at him and this time when you hit the ball, it flew pretty high. You dropped the bat like your life depended on it and ran to the first base.When you got there, you looked around to see where Jeff was but he was still chasing the ball. This was your cue to run further.“Babe! I’m winning!” you screamed at him while running.Jeff turned around and instead of chasing the ball anymore, he started to chase you. “Oh hell no Y/N!”You screamed in joy and when you were almost at the third base, Jeff caught up with you and grabbed your waist. You both fell down on the base with him on top of you.“Well, well, well.” Jeff grinned at you and stroked your hair. “Looks like I’ve got a girlfriend who’s good at baseball,” he smiled as he kissed you softly.One of your hands stroked his hair while the other stroked his jaw. “I love you, Jeff Atkins,” you whispered after you broke your kiss. This was the first time you told him that.Jeff’s eyes widened, but then a broad smile spread across his face. He kissed you passionately and then kissed your forehead. “I love you too, Y/N Y/L/N.”After that, you decided you played enough baseball and Jeff helped you up. You started slapping all of the sand off your body and when you turned around Jeff smacked your bum.“Jeff!” you yelped.“Sorry, there was a bit of sand there,” he smirked and you laughed at him and shook your head.“So, how was your date with Y/N?” Clay asked Jeff at the cafeteria.“Oh it was very nice, we went to third base actually.” Jeff grinned.Clay just stared at him with his mouth open. “Jeff, I don’t need to know that,” he said while blushing.“You know I’m talking about baseball right.”Clay sighed and started laughing, “Yeah, I knew.”Jeff just grinned and looked at you at the other end of the cafeteria, sitting with your friend Paige.You looked at him and winked, making a mental note that you should play baseball with Jeff more often.
