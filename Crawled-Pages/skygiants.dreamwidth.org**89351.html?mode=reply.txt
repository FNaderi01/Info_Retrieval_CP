skygiantsGeorgette Heyer has pretty much been my stress-relief reading of choice this year; no matter how ridiculous the plots and romances, I never fail to giggle my way through her books!  Regency Buck is mostly notable because of the gloriously ridiculous plot; Spunky Judith and her Dumb Would-Be Dandy Brother Perry, recently orphaned and left with a significant fortune, show up in London to find out that their father has accidentally made a hot twentysomething gentleman their guardian.  Awkward!  Hijinks, of course, ensue.  There is a plot to murder Perry and marry Judith, and anyone who has ever read a romance novel before will guess the culprit within twenty pages but that does not make it any less enjoyable to read about the poisoned snuff!!!! and the WACKY KIDNAPPING!!!!  (My favorite part is how Perry pops back up after the kidnapping all "DUDE I GOT TO SPEND A WEEK IN A BOAT I LOVE BOATS CAN I HAVE ONE PLEASE PLEASE DAD I MEAN HOT TWENTYSOMETHING GUARDIAN PLEASE?")  The best character is without a doubt Beau Brummell, legendary dandy, who gives the heroine hilarious advice on how to Be Original and Spunky and spends the rest of the book making sarcastic remarks.Sylvester, on the other hand, is most fun because of the meta.  The heroine has written a gothic novel and stolen the hero's evil-looking eyebrows for the villianous uncle; when everyone becomes convinced he's going to propose to her (he's not) that she runs away with her BFF Tom just to escape the OVERWHELMING AWKWARD.  A heroine after my own heart!  It grows even MORE awkward when she finds out that he actually has been left sole guardianship of his nephew, and half the town is convinced that he is totally an evil uncle for serious.  OOPS.  The completely platonic relationship between Phoebe and her BFF Tom is awesome, especially the bits where he's all "Well . . . uh . . . I guess if you're really in deep trouble we could elope . . ." and she is like "no offense but EW NO" and he is like "OH THANK GOD."  It also has an awesome device that I have seen Heyer use before really well, which is a bunch of people getting trapped in an inn together and developing a really nice bantery cameraderie that is just fun to read.  There is also another hilarious kidnapping and hijinks involving tragically destroyed boots.  Lots of fun!
