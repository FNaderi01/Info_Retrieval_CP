    Summary
      The Sentinel/Guide AU you didn't know you wanted. (Maybe.)Raleigh Becket is a Sentinel. He's been a Sentinel for five years--five, long fucking years, in isolation, atop the Wall in Alaska. By all accounts, he shouldn't be sane. But he is--mostly--and when Stacker Pentecost comes to collect him, he makes an offer Raleigh can't refuse.The chance to fight again...and to find his Guide.The two Guides who train him drag him from existing to living; one even becomes his co-pilot. But they are not his Guide. It's not until much later on that he realizes his Guide has been glaring at him almost the entire time.

    Summary
      A series of oneshots/outtakes from Fate Has a Fucked Up Sense of Humor.Some are fluffy, some are angsty, some are both.All are Chuck/Raleigh, with possible hints of other pairings.(Also, unless otherwise confirmed, all are in that universe but have not occurred in relation to the actual story. Yeah. It's...like AU-ception or something.)

    Summary
      AU in which the Beckets have been transferred to Sydney along with Mako.Chapter One: Chuck is not happy about this.Until he maybe sorta kinda is.Because he hasn't really had friends...especially not friends like these three.(This is not a foursome fic. There is no sex. I cannot write smut so there will never be sex.)Chapter Two:Raleigh's turn. It's close the anniversary of the Knifehead incident, Max hates him and Chuck seems captivated by this new tech.He is not having a good time.Luckily, Yancy, Mako and even Herc know what he seems oblivious to.
