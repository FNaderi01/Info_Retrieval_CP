                The Divine GoatAmaltheia -Other names - Amalthea - o - Pronunciation - {am-al-thee'-uh} - o - Etymology - "Tender"The divine goat who suckled Zeus on Crete, his island of birth, when he was still an infant. In other traditions, Amaltheia was a nymph who nourished Zeus with honey and the milk of a goat. Out of gratitude Zeus turned one of the goat's horns into the Cornucopia ("horn of plenty") which was always filled with whatever its possessor wished. In some traditions, the goat's skin became the Aegis, the legendary shield of Athena."Amaltheia." Pantheon.org. Vers.20021995-2002. Encyclopedia Mythica.23 Sep. 2002http://www.pantheon.org/articles/a/amaltheia.htmlWell, I'm not greek, a nymph or a goat, divine or otherwise. Nor am I the bearer of the Cornucopia. If I was I think I would get invited to a lot more parties.I am english, female, 30 years of age, a fan of many, many shows and a writer of fiction both Fan and Original. Oh, and a net junkie.I have a husband, two sons and twins daughters, a sister, a mother, a father, some nieces and nephews, two Aunts, lots of cousins and friends. Oh, and a bad tempered cat and two kittens.Feel free to friend me, and I'll mostly likely friend you back.  If I don't it's probably laziness on my part.Oooo! More stuff about me:-I breastfeed, and I moderate the breastfeedinguk community.  And yes, I stand by the Elizabeth Gene quote. I am a feminist. To avoid confusion, my definition of a feminist is someone who believes men and women are equal, and should be treated equally. Someone who hates men IS NOT a feminist.I read het and slash (and to me personally, slash = m/m and f/f, but I accept that femslash for f/f is the more widely recognised convention) but prefer gen (I like the relationships/pairing to serve the plot, rather than the plot serving the relationships/pairing).  I don't ship anyone as a matter of course, you have to sell me on a pairing.I take a drabble to be a complete story of exactly 100 words, and it pisses me off when people don't adhere to this definition as writing true drabbles is harder than it looks.  I like copperbadge's usage of flopsy for ficlet of 80 to 300 words.I have written one RPS and read both RPF and RPS when people I read, write them. If you don't like RPF/RPS I respect that, but you're not going to change my mind.I try to live my LJ life as drama free as possible, but like everybody I have my moments of immaturity. I defriend because I've stopped reading (generic)your journal or I feel you've behaved in a manner I cannot condone. If it's the latter reason I'm not going to make a fuss about it, but if you ask me I will tell you why.I'm amazingly crap at replying at comments, if you really want a reply feel free to poke me until I answer. However if you're flaming me, don't hold your breath, I don't believe in feeding flames.Despite the above, I don't really take myself that seriously.Buy me things. (Aw, go on).My Johari window
