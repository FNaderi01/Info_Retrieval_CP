109! (Billy) Seems like a mob boss type thing to me but do whatever you want!💖💖
I combined the two requests. “Sometimes, I wake up and you’re in another city.” &amp; “Do you like money?”Requests are closed.
Everybody told him to stay away from you, the girl with the giggly eyes. Billy couldn’t resist though. Whether it was from the green strobe lights that you ground against him under or the addictive poison on your tongue, Billy felt like he was addicted to being around you. It was nice to be with someone who laughed as loud as he did and saw joy in all things raw. He had just ended a relationship with someone who took life seriously, so it was a welcome change to chase sunset with vodka shots and your zest for life. You both said it wasn’t going to be serious, just fun. Billy was embarrassed when he realized he was the one breaking that agreement. He was driving around with electricity surging through his body, drumming on the wheel of his car, too drunk to be operating it without dancing, and laughing at how you threw your head around in the passenger seat. “I don’t want tonight to end.” As he sharply took a corner and drove toward your building, he called at you over the music. “The night ended hours ago.” You tapped at the clock on his stereo, flashing 3:12 AM, and laughed. “But I’m not done with you yet if that’s what you mean.” You smiled and pushed out of the seat to crawl over the stick shift and kiss him, pressing your chest into him, leaving a magenta lipstick stain on his jaw, cheek, and leading lower. As your fingers toyed with the zipper of his jeans, Billy forgave himself. He dared another man to live through this and not fall in love with you. “Don’t leave tomorrow. Call in sick.” Billy whined up the staircase of your building, stopping every few steps to grab at your dress and pull you into him, his hot whiskey breath burning at your face. “I can’t.” You shook your head as you two kissed. “Sometimes, I wake up and you’re in another city.” He whined and nipped at your nose, hand tossing your locks around and his forehead stamped on yours. “That’s not very fair, is it?” “That’s just what hanging out with a flight attendant is.” You refused to say ‘dating’. “Besides, you get to hang out in my apartment when I’m gone. Where else do you get to crash for free and does it also have a pool?” Billy had never helped himself to your pool, he had never even rolled around your bed with another girl, but he did enjoy the perks of free lodging in your place that was nicer and bigger than his spot outside of Los Angeles, a small bachelor he shared with Anthony Kane in Fresno. Fingers crawling against his palm, you led him up the last two flights of stairs and then down the hall to your one bedroom. “Stop pouting. I don’t want to blow someone who likes they just lost their puppy.” You leaned a hip against your front door and started clumsily unstrapping your heels in the dark, teasing Billy in multiple ways as you did. He woke up to the sunlight streaming into his eyes and groaned instinctively before reaching over for you. You usually turned onto your side during sleep while Billy laid flat on his back. His fingers searched for you before he opened his eyes, but all he felt were satin sheets in his grip. You had snuck away before and, at first, he didn’t care, but Billy had since let you know that he wanted a long goodbye. Thankfully, he heard your unmistakable laugh down the hall. It brought him out of bed and walked out naked, following your joyful voice until he was standing in the open door of your bathroom.There he saw the girl that his friends all talked about. The troublemaker, the dangerous vixen, and the friend of very sketchy people. You were sucking in your stomach, wearing only a thin white lacy thong and matching bra, and a belt of packed cocaine like a cincher around your waist. Billy watched and rubbed the sleep in his eyes as you mindlessly tied your hair into it’s uniform bun in front of the mirror, a man sitting on the side of your yellow bathtub adjusting tape around the drugs on your body. Next to you both, near the toilet, your suitcase sat open and packed with more fresh coke. “Morning, sleepy head.” You grinned and waved, but Billy was too stunned to speak. You two had got fucked up on different stuff before, but doing party drugs was different than being a drug mule. “Billy, have you met Moe?”The guy against the bath tub reached one hand out, the other still holding down a piece of duct tape. Billy clued into how naked he was and waved instead of shaking Moe’s hand. “We’ll be done in a few minutes. I just have to get dressed. Do you want to drive me to the airport?” You asked as if you weren’t wearing five pounds of premium cocaine, taking it to Miami and then Toronto. Slowly, you closed the bathroom door and blew him a kiss before it fully shut. Billy proudly considered himself a bad ass, but this was bigger than any bar fight he started or road rage he indulged in. It felt a little bit bigger than hi. He was getting dressed when he heard movement behind him. He expected to see you in your blue uniform that he found  incredibly sexy, but instead he pulled on a shirt and saw Moe once it was his head.“Hey, Billy, right?” Moe knew what his name was, but played pleasent anyway. “Yeah.”“[Y/N]’s told me about you. Says you’re a good driver, keep to yourself, cool guy…”“Yeah.” Billy had half a mind to ask the guy for a spliff. He was feeling very uncomfortable. “Do you like money?” Moe wiped at his chin and asked, finally smiling even if only slightly. He knew Billy’s answers would match this last two. He knew that he was about to land a team member who would become beloved and necessary in his business even if Billy didn’t.

Also wedding and grad season is just a busy time of year for me, but I have not stopped with Billy stories. Just tending to life stuff at the moment. Hope you’re all well.
