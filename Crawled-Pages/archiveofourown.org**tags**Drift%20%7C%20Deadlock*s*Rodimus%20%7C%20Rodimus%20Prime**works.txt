    Summary
      Because sometimes you just need to write some fluff. Though, knowing me, it's not really all that fluffy...Basically just a bunch of random Transformers ship drabbles, some based on prompts and others not. Rating, tags, universe, and ship varies by chapter. Warnings and such will be included where applicable.Contains most of my Favorite ships that I use a lot. Updates will be sporadic, mostly when I feel like posting a new chapter XDFirst chapter is just an intro. Sort of inspired by other drabble collections I've seen in format but not content.

      A short drabble AU where they still lose the Lost Light but Rodimus pursues more space adventures by himself. He has a relationship with Drift and Ratty but feels the need the distance himself because he doesn't feel like he deserves this.//Ratchet sighs wearily and touches his arm as if to ground him there. “Are you alright out there? By yourself?”, he asks all gentle and worried and again his spark aches.

    Summary
      All the Con Claiming Culture fics that exist independently of each other!Decepticon Claiming Culture is the practice of one mech claiming another (or multiple) mechs as “theirs” in a public and permanent fashion. The idea of ownership isn’t attached, instead the idea is that it’s a permanent contract between mechs, where one is protected, cared for, and closely involved with the other. IE, if you mess with the Claimed mech, you are messing with the person who made said claim.

    Summary
  Their helms are just inches apart when they finally collect themselves, their attempt at calming down broken up by bouts of snickering. A sweet, light joy bubbles through Rodimus that has him grinning uncertainly at Drift as their optics meet. They’ve been close before, but never like this. Never where Rodimus’ exhaust pipes bracket Drift’s helm. Never where Drift’s servo hovers hesitantly over Rodimus’ abdominal plating. Never where they can each feel the press of a question with every unsteady in-and-exvent.
