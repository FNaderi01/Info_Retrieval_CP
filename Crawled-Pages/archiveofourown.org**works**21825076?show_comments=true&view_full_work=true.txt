Everyone, off your phones and head to class! Broccoli Boy: :P 
  10:37 PM
 Broccoli Boy: Alright, so you know how the LOV is always after us? Knock Off Sonic: Midoriya, it's 10:37! What are you still doing up?  Broccoli Boy: Says the one who is also up at 10:37. Anyway, you know how the LOV is always after us?  Pikachu: Yeah? Broccoli Boy: What if we just… went after them instead? Like, give them a taste of their own medicine. Find them when they're doing what they do when they're not being pieces of shit and beat them up.  We All Float: …Deku? When's the last time you slept? Broccoli Boy: Time is irrelevant, but if you must know, Wednesday 3-D Printer: But… it's Monday… Broccoli Boy: Yup Zuko and Elsa's Love Child: Midoriya, go to sleep Broccoli Boy: Too late, I just downed a whole pot of coffee Knock off Sonic: Midoriya I am coming to your room right now!

Get the fuck to bed Deku! 
  Broccoli Boy changed his name to Tired Boy
 Tired Boy: Make me 
  Pikachu: [Video]
 Pikachu: I guess Bakugou knocking Midoriya out kinda helps? I mean, Midoriya is asleep now. We All Float: Honestly I was close to doing it myself Grape Boy: I'm going back to sleep now. I don't want to end up like Midoriya 
  11:30 AM
  Tired Boy changed his name to Snap Crackle Pop
 Hard Boy: Um...why? Snap Crackle Pop: Because when I use my power I have lightning fly around me and if I use too much of my power, my bones snap, crackle, and pop. Tape Dispenser: That is a horrifying thing to imagine and is now stuck in my brain. Alien Queen: Ever since Midoriya started this group chat I’m getting more and more worried for him Pikachu: Midoriya, is this some kind of silent plee for help? Punk Rock: *Plea Kermit the Frog: Midoriya, you need more sleep Snap Crackle Pop: Wow. I’m not used to this many people actually caring about me. This would have been a lot more helpful in middle school Snap Crackle Pop: Scratch that. I needed thi s my whole life Knock Off Sonic: Midoriya, as soon as classes are over I demand that you take a nap! Snap Crackle Pop: Alright We All Float: Actually, where are you right now? You’re usually at our table by now Snap Crackle Pop: In the vents Tape Dispenser: Like… in the school vents? 
  Snap Crackle Pop: [Image]
   Attached is an image of the cafeteria from above. 
  Tentacool: [Image]
   Attached is an image of Midoriya, poking his face out of a vent on the ceiling of the cafeteria. 
 3-D Printer: First of all, how did you get up there? Second, why are you up there? Snap Crackle Pop: Why are any of us here? We All Float: Deku, stay there! I’m going to float up there to get you! Tape Dispenser: I’ll use my tape to real you guys in! Sweet Tooth: Why is this class like this?

  3:00 AM
  Snap Crackle Pop changed his name to Mini Might
  Mini Might: 
  Hey, do you guys ever get that feeling that you’re not living up to your full potential and everyone secretly hates you? That everyone is judging you thinking that you’re a terrible person but they won’t say it out loud? And you also have this thing that’s just weighing down on your chest and you feel guilty for just existing? 
  Mini Might: 
  Eh, me neither.

  Mini Tape: 
  Mine barely makes any sense! 
  Mini Pikachu: 
  And Midoriya just passes out while brushing his teeth…
  Mini Punk: 
  Do you think we could just leave him here and tell Aizawa he was feeling bad?
  Mini Kermit: 
  That would probably be for the best. He hasn’t been sleeping well lately
  Tentacool: 
  I’m carrying him to his room now. He’s out like a light
  Nobody: 
  Alright, then we’ll let him sleep today!
  Mini Elsa/Zuko: 
  He’s seemed really sleep deprived lately…
  Sweet Tooth: 
  By the way, I made some bread for everyone. It’s on the counter. See you guys in class!
  Animal Lover:

  Nobody: 
  Koda spoke! And thanks Sato! It’s really good. See ya in class!

  Mini Might: 
  Where is everyone? Why did I wake up in my bed?

  Space Cadet: 
  Deku just called him his full name
  Mini Crimson:

  Cinnamon Roll:

  2:09 AM
  Mad Banquet of Darkness: 
  Midoriya is on the roof
  Mini Alien changed her name to Pink!
  Pink!: 
  At 2 AM?
  Mini Printer changed her name to The Creator
  The Creator: 
  Who wants to make him go to bed this time? Also, is this something that was always happening? Did we just become aware of it because of this chat?
  Pink!: 
  Maybe Midoriya has insomnia or something?
  Mad Banquet of Darkness: 
  I’ll get him to bed. Going onto the roof now
  Pink!: 
  Good luck Tokoyami!
  The Creator: 
  Good night
  7:40 AM
  Cinnamon Roll changed his name to Deku
  Deku: 
  Hey guys, don’t worry if you find me on the roof at odd hours. I do have insomnia, so I like to go up there to relax
  The Creator: 
  Do you have any medicine for it?
  Nyoom: 
  Is there anything we can do to help?
  Deku: 
  It’s fine! Just letting you guys know so that you don’t come up on the roof when you see me up there. It’s all good.
  Earphone Jack: 
  I can make a playlist with some calming music to help
  Sweet Tooth: 
  And I can make you some low sugar cookies and warm milk every night!
  Deku: 
  I’m fine! 
  Deku: 
  Anyway, time to go! See ya in class!
  11:23 AM
  Space Cadet changed Deku’s name to Cinnamon Roll that Needs to be Protected
  Cinnamon Roll that Needs to be Protected changed his name to Trash
  Trash: 
  So, it has come to my attention that I was wrong
  Space Cadet: 
  Wrong about what?
  Trash: 
  Wrong about life
  Nyoom: 
  What?
  Trash: 
  None of this exists. Reality as we see it is wrong. We are only anime characters made to suffer
  Nyoom: 
  Midoriya, we are real
  Flex Tape: 
  What if we were actually just a fanfiction about an anime? Like, what we’re saying is just what a weird girl is typing while huddled over her laptop with anime playing on her phone?
  Trash: 
  Of course! That’s exactly what’s going on!
  Pika Pika Pi: 
  What if when we forget what we’re going to say, it’s just the writer backspacing!?
  Explodokills: 
  Are...are you guys high?
  Trash: 
  Nope, we just ascended to a higher plane of existence
  9:36 PM
  Trash: 
  I’m going to yeet myself out of the window
  The Creator: 
  Why?
  Trash: 
  I accidentally called All Might dad
  Icey Hot: 
  Because he is your dad
  Trash: 
  Wrong. Anyway, he texted back calling me son and I don't know what to do 
  Icey Hot changed Trash's name to All Might's Son
  Icey Hot changed his name to Conspiracy Theorist
  Conspiracy Theorist: 
  Now I just have to wait for my other theories to be confirmed. 
  All Might's Son: 
  Welp, this is my life now. I'm going on the roof 
  Conspiracy Theorist:
   Come to my room first. I have something to give you 
  All Might's Son: 
  Alright 
  7:01 AM
  Flex Tape: 
  Midoriya, why were you in Todoroki's room this morning? 
  Conspiracy Theorist: 
  I managed to get Midoriya to fall asleep when he came to room last night
  All Might's Son: 
  Curse you and your comforting warmth. Although, I always did go to bed easier if I slept near someone, so it makes sense
  Flex Tape: 
  If that's the case, then you can always come by my room if you want. I promise I don't punch people in my sleep lol
  Tentacool: 
  I wouldn't mind either 
  Rock: 
  It could be like a slumber party! And we could take turns having Midoriya sleeping with us.
  The Creator: 
  I would volunteer if Aizawa wouldn't protest. Though, we all know Midoriya is too innocent to do anything. Unlike a certain someone.
  Pika Pika Pi: 
  No longer will you have to stay up every night Midoriya! Just come to one of us and we'll let you sleep with us. I think the only ones who would really protest would be Bakugou and Mineta.
  Grape Boy: 
  As long as he brought a futon and stayed at the opposite end of my room, I wouldn't mind.
  All Might's Son: 
  You guys don't have to D:! I wouldn't want to disturb anyone or anything 
  Rock: 
  Midoriya, you're pretty important to our class, and you help us out a lot. Anything we can do to repay you we will do.
  All Might's Son: 
  Alright...but only if you guys are sure…
  Conspiracy Theorist: 
  Midoriya is super cuddly, if you guys were wondering 
  Pink!: 
  Can confirm. One time he fell asleep next to me while we were watching something on tv and he was like, the best thing to cuddle with ever. Better than my giant alien plushie!
  Conspiracy Theorist changed All Might's Son's name to Best Cuddler
  Best Cuddler: 
  I don't know how to feel about this
  Best Cuddler: 
  By the way, my phone is acting up so if some strange messages appear...it's not me
  Flex Tape: 
  What?
  1:20 PM
  Best Cuddler: 
  So, is anyone going to tell All Might that he has a hole on the back of his pants?
  Pink!: 
  He has American underwear…
  Conspiracy Theorist: 
  You're his son, you should do it
  Best Cuddler: 
  But Iida is class rep, so he should
  Nyoom: 
  I pass that off to Yaoyorozu, since she is vice rep
  The Creator: 
  Nope.
  Explodokills: 
  You're all fucking wimps! I'll do it!
  Space Cadet:
   Oh wow, I didn't think someone could get that red
  Pika Pika Pi: 
  Just like his underwear lol
  Nyoom: 
  Alright, everyone off of their phones! We need to pay attention in class!
  6:56 PM
  Pika Pika Pi: 
  Alright, so who is Midoriya sleeping with tonight? How are we going to decide this?
  Flex Tape: 
  I volunteer 
  Conspiracy Theorist: 
  I kinda want him to sleep with me again. He's really cuddly.
  Pink!: 
  I'll gladly take him!
  Rock: 
  I'm up for him staying with me tonight
  Pika Pika Pi: 
  I guess we'll let him choose? 
  @Best Cuddler
  Rock: @Best Cuddler
  Conspiracy Theorist: @Best Cuddler 
  Best Cuddler:
   Oh, hey!
  Pika Pika Pi: 
  Who do you choose to sleep with tonight?
  Rock:
   Just saying, I have a weighted blanket 
  Best Cuddler: 
  …. Kirishima I'll be right over
  Pika Pika Pi: 
  You cheated :O ! 
  Rock: 
  I just stated the facts
  Flex Tape:
   Cheated
  Conspiracy Theorist: 
  Cheated
  Pink!: 
  Cheated
  Rock:
   :p
  Rock: 
  Oh wow. As soon as he got under the blanket he passed out.
  Pink!: 
  I'm jealous D:

  Best Cuddler: 
  I’m going back to sleep now
  Nobody: 
  Wha…. well, I’m not going to get any sleep now
  Mad Banquet of Darkness: 
  What a mad banquet of darkness
  Nobody changed Mad Banquet of Darkness’s name to Dark Birb
      Chapter 3: Everyone Wants to Sleep with Midoriya
        Notes:
          I got some inspiration from Noonez_Trash's What's Crackalackin? and if you've read it, you would understand why

    Chapter Text
  6:49 AM
  Nobody: 
  Alright, so is anyone else curious about why Midoriya's phone is possessed by a demon named Zuzu?
  The Creator: 
  I will admit, I did not think I would ever read that sentence 
  Conspiracy Theorist: @Explodokills 
  is this normal?
  Explodokills: 
  Yeah, pretty much.
  Best Cuddler: 
  He gets lonely
  Best Cuddler changed Rock's name to Comfy Rock
  Comfy Rock: 
  I'm glad you slept well!
  Best Cuddler: 
  :D
  Nyoom: 
  So, we now have what, two, three demons in the dorms?
  Nobody: 
  Class rep is calling people demons?
  Nyoom:
   Bakugou, Mineta, and now Zuzu
  Nobody: 
  I mean, true.
  Best Cuddler: 
  Dont worry Zuzu is nice! And he's contained to my phone
  Explodokills:
   WJAT DO UOU MEAN IM A DEMON!? SAY THAT TO MY FACE FOUR EYED!
  Pika Pika Pi changed Explodokills's name to Angry Boy
  Angry Boy:
   FUCK YOU DISCOUNT PIKACHU 
  Comfy Rock: 
  Chill Bakugou! 
  Angry Boy: 
  DONT TELL ME WHAT TO DO SHITTY HAIR
  Comfy Rock: @Pink! 
  Likes my hair!
  Pink!: 
  I do, honestly 
  Nyoom: 
  Everyone, please calm down and get ready for class!
  Pika Pika Pi:
   Chill class rep! It just turned 7 and some of us are still waking up
  Pink!:
   Oh, hey, while I'm here….
  Pink!: 
  I call dibs on Midoriya duty tonight! 
  Pika Pika Pi: 
  No fair!
  Flex Tape:
   Fine, I call dibs on tomorrow!
  Pika Pika Pi: 
  Shit! I call the day after that!
  Angry Boy: 
  Why the fuck are you guys fighting over sleeping with the nerd!?
  Comfy Rock: 
  Dude, it's like cuddling with an angel. It's like… as soon as you lay down with him, all of life's problems just disappear 
  Pink!: 
  Can confirm 
  Space Cadet:
   Awww man! Why does the Bakusquad get first dibs on sleeping with Deku?
  Pink!: 
  You snooze you lose lol. You can go next though
  Pink!: 
  Plus, Todoroki was technically the first, then Kirishima, and today it shall be me!
  Pika Pika Pi: 
  We should keep a list
  Flex Tape: 
  We can set up an order and then rotate!
  Tentacool: 
  I'll sign up for after Uraraka
  Pink!: 
  So Todoroki, Eijiro, me, Hanta, Denki, Uraraka, then Shoji so far… 
  @Everyone
   you better sign up fast before you end up at the bottom!
  Nobody: 
  I call after Shoji! And dont think I missed how you called some people by their first names~!
  Animal Lover: 
  I'll be after Hagakure
  Nobody: 
  He speaks again!
  Nyoom: 
  I guess I'll volunteer next then
  Froppy:
   Me
  Sweet Tooth:
   I'll volunteer 
  Best Cuddler: 
  What did I come back to?
  Pink!:
   We're making an order for who you'll sleep with. So far we have Todoroki, Eijiro, me, Hanta, Denki, Uraraka, Shoji, Hagakure, Koda, Iida, Asui, then Sato
  Best Cuddler: 
  Oh uh… you guys dont have to… but thanks!
  Comfy Rock:
   Midoriya… sleeping with you granted me the best sleep I ever had. We should be thanking you.
  Pika Pika Pi: 
  Are we sure you dont have two quirks like Todoroki? 
  Best Cuddler: 
  Well, my mom can attract objects to her and my dad breathes fire. 
  Best Cuddler:
   Somehow I got a strength quirk instead of those
  Pink!: 
  What if the attracting objects mutated into attracting people, but in a cuddly way? So people just feel an urge to cuddle with you? 
  Best Cuddler: 
  I mean… sure?
  Angry Boy: 
  Bullshit! I've never wanted to cuddle Deku
  Pink!: 
  Or you just deny the urge so much that you dont realize that you're denying it
  The Creator: 
  Alright everyone, it is getting late and we should head to class soon. Also, I call after Sato
  8:20 AM
  Pika Pika Pi:
   Aizawa is falling asleep at the podium. He must be really tired
  Earphone Jack:
   Weird. He must have had a long night. Or he has insomnia like Midoriya. Oh, I call after Momo by the way
  Tail Man: 
  I feel like I should look in this chat more often, but I'm also slightly scared of it. And I can take Midoriya after Jiro
  Best Cuddler changed his name to Broke Boy
  Broke Boy changed Tail Man's name to Where's Waldo
  Broke Boy: 
  Even Koda has talked more than you 
  Where's Waldo changed his name to Tails
  Tails: 
  What about Aoyama?
  Broke Boy: 
  You have a point. Both of you haven't talked yet
  Glitter Force: 
  I merely find it more entertaining to watch
  Glitter Force: 
  You can sign me up after Sato, by the way. For now though, au revoir!
  Grape Boy: 
  Did Aizawa just fall asleep standing up?
  Grape Boy: 
  Kaminari, I'll give you 2000 yen if you go poke him
  Pika Pika Pi: 
  No thanks, I don't want to die
  Space Cadet: 
  You know what? I'll take you up on that offer
  Grape Boy: 
  If you actually do it I'll give you 5,000 yen!
  Space Cadet: 
  Woot
  Pink!: 
  I got to record this….
  Pink!: [Video]
    Attached is a video of Uraraka moving quietly up to Aizawa, then poking him. Right after, most of the class is tied up in Aizawa's scarf.
  3:48 PM
  Comfy Rock:
   Hey guys? We, as in the Bakusquad, have something to confess
  Broke Boy: 
  Alright, where's the body? And Yaomomo, can you make us two shovels and a body bag?
  Flex Tape: 
  WTF?
  Pink!: 
  It's not a body! Though, I guess it is nice to know that you would help us hide a body
  Pika Pika Pi: 
  By the way, what's up with your new name Midoriya? 
  Broke Boy: 
  Its cause I break myself all the time
  Angry Boy: 
  JUST GET TO THE POINT NERDS!
  Comfy Rock: 
  Oh yeah! Anyway, please dont think anything different about us but…
  Pink!: 
  We're
  Flex Tape: 
  In
  Pika Pika Pi: 
  A
  Comfy Rock: 
  Poly 
  Angry Boy: 
  Relationship 
  Broke Boy: 
  Honestly? I'm not surprised. Good for you guys 
  Space Cadet: 
  Good for you guys! 
  Nyoom: 
  I'm glad that you five feel comfortable enough to share that with us!
  The Creator:
   I'm happy for you all!
  Pink!: 
  Cool. Better reactions than I was expecting 
  Angry Boy: 
  Told you no one would say anything bad Pinky!
  Conspiracy Theorist changed his name to Burning Cold
  Burning Cold: 
  Good for you guys. 
  Pink!: 
  BTW, this doesn't mean any of us are giving up our turns for the Midoriya Sleeping Schedule 
  Pink!: 
  The order so far is: Todoroki, Kirishima, Ashido, Sero, Kaminari, Uraraka, Shoji, Hagakure, Koda, Iida, Asui, Sato, Yaoyorozu, Jiro, Ojiro, Aoyama, and Bakugou
  Angry Boy: 
  Like hell I'll let the nerd sleep with me!
  Flex Tape: 
  Sorry, but you're just going to have to accept it
  Pika Pika Pi: 
  Yup
  Comfy Rock: 
  Let's face it, Mina wears the pants in our relationship 
  Pink!: 
  Damn right I do! ;P
  Dark Birb: 
  Oh, I forgot to sign up. As long as Midoriya doesn't mind Dark Shadow moving around some times 
  Broke Boy: 
  I'm fine with that. He's really cool anyway!
  Dark Birb: 
  …
  Dark Birb changed Broke Boy's name to Sunshine Boy
  Sweet Tooth:  
  Has anyone else noticed that Midoriya changes his name to kinda depressing things while everyone else changes them to happy things?
  Nobody: 
  We have
  Sunshine Boy: 
  Why tho
  Burning Cold: 
  Just accept that you're the class cinnamon roll.
  Pink!: 
  You are basically like a child that we all have joint custody over, only you are able to live on your own and stuff
  Froppy: 
  I agree with Ashido. That's one of the reasons why we're setting up a sleeping schedule for you 
  Angry Boy: 
  Deku, how the fuck did you brainwash all these people? 
  Sunshine Boy: 
  No clue. I'm blaming Zuzu

  Pika Pika Pi: 
  He literally has been asking for souls 
  Sunshine Boy: 
  H e ' s  a  g o o d  b o y
  Pika Pika Pi: 
  Fair enough 
  Angry Boy: 
  Zuzu once threatened to cut me while I slept 
  Sunshine Boy: 
  He was just joking
  Angry Boy: 
  You and I both know that isn't true, bastard!
  Sunshine Boy: 
  Stop being a little bitch Kacchan 
  Angry Boy: 
  Fuck you Deku!
  Nobody: 
  Midoriya did a swear!
  Pika Pika Pi: 
  *Sirens sound in the background*
  Pink!: 
  *Police and heroes surround the building*
  Flex Tape: 
  *Gavin screams*
  Comfy Rock: 
  *Shots are fired*
  Sunshine Boy changed Angry Boy's name to Little Bitch
  Little Bitch changed Sunshine Boy's name to Crybaby Fucker
  Crybaby Fucker: 
  … I can't deny it
  Little Bitch: 
  Hah! Oh shit, wait, WHAT DID YOU CHANGE MY NAME TO!?
  Crybaby Fucker: 
  (╹◡╹)凸
  Space Cadet: 
  How did you make that emoji?
  Crybaby Fucker: 
  Copy and paste
  Crybaby Fucker:

  Crybaby Fucker: 
  This is Kacchan: щ(ಠ益ಠщ)
  Little Bitch: 
  I'll get you for this Deku!
  Pink!: 
  Wait till after my turn at least! I still need to cuddle with him tonight.
  Little Bitch: 
  ……..fine
  Burning Cold: 
  Whipped 
  Little Bitch: 
  YOU BETTER WATCH YOUR BACK ICY HOT!
        Notes:
          I have an odd fascination for the Bakusquad as a poly group, like the Scooby-Doo gang

  7:01 AM
  Grape Boy: 
  Alright so 
  Grape Boy: 
  Zuzu and Midoriya had a long talk with me
  Nobody: 
  Zuzu and Midoriya? 
  Grape Boy:
   Yeah. Basically, I realized how wrong my actions were because of the talk and I want to apologize to everyone for my previous actions. Especially the girls. I'm sorry for everything I've done, and I'm going to do my best to be a better person
  Space Cadet: 
  Holy shit I never expected this day would come 
  Pink!: 
  Glad to hear it! Thanks Midoriya! 
  The Creator: 
  I accept your apology and look forward to seeing you keep up that resolve
  Nobody: 
  That's great! What did you say to him Midoriya? 
  Froppy: 
  Thank you for apologizing 
  Earphone Jack: 
  That's good to hear. 
 Crybaby Fucker: (✿◠‿◠) He just needed some respect women juice 
  Space Cadet changed Crybaby Fucker's name to Respect Women Juice
  Respect Women Juice: 
  Alright then
  Pink!: 
  This is why even if we're in relationships we still stan you Midoriya 
  Froppy: 
  It's true
  Little Bitch: 
  What's going on?
  Little Bitch changed his name to Explosions
  Respect Women Juice: 
  Zuzu and I convinced Mineta to change his ways
  Grape Boy: 
  Pretty much
  Pink!: 
  Sorry Bakubae, but Midoriya is our king now
  Explosions: 
  Wow, the nerd actually did something good
  Respect Women Juice: 
  \(´ ▽ ` )ﾉ
  Space Cadet: 
  Can you send me like… a list of those? So I can use them too?
  Respect Women Juice: 
  Sorry, but they're my branding
  Space Cadet: 
  Understood, have a nice day!
  Nobody: 
  Just curious, but who's in a relationship now? 
  Pink!: 
  The Bakusquad 
  Froppy: 
  Uraraka and I
  The Creator: 
  Jiro and I
  Nobody: 
  So…. I'm the only girl not in a relationship….
  Burning Cold:
   I thought we all were in a relationship with Midoriya 
  Nobody: 
  Oh yeah! True
  Respect Women Juice: 
  Wait what
  Space Cadet: 
  Didn't we tell you? We decided that you're dating all of us Deku
  Space Cadet: 
  Like, in a spiritual way
  Respect Women Juice:
   …
  Respect Women Juice: 
  How am I supposed to tell my mom I now have 21 datemates?
  Pink! 
  21?
  Respect Women Juice: 
  Zuzu and Shinso
  Comfy Rock: 
  Shinso? And your phone demon?
  Respect Women Juice: 
  Shinso and I are insomniac boyfriends
  Respect Women Juice: 
  And Zuzu claimed me when he showed up
  Explosions changed Respect Women Juice's name to Slut
  Slut: 
  Excuse you
  Slut changed his name to Tired Slut
  Tired Slut: 
  There.
  Pink!: 
  You were out like a light as soon as we started cuddling though. We went to bed at 9 
  Tired Slut: 
  I'm always tired
  Pink!: 
  Fair enough
  Tired Slut: 
  Wait
  Tired Slut: 
  Didn’t you say I was like everyone’s child earlier Ashido?
  Pink!: 
  Don’t overthink it
  Tired Slut: 
  Alright
  11:04 AM
  Nyoom: 
  Midoriya, are you in the vents again?
  Tired Slut: 
  Would you be mad if I say yes?
  Nyoom: 
  Just…. Why? And how do you get in them?
  Tired Slut: 
  Welllllllll my quirk let’s me jump high, so I just jump to the ceiling, grab a vent, remove the cover, then slide in
  The Creator: 
  But why?
  Tired Slut: 
  Because. It’s cozy in here.
  Tired Slut: 
  That and Shinso is in here
  Pika Pika Pi: 
  WHY IS SHINSO IN THERE!?
  Tired Slut: 
  Cause. It’s our meeting spot
  Nobody: 
  I am so close to adding Dadazawa and Present Mic in here
  Tired Slut: 
  Nooooooo
  Nobody: 
  I won’t hesitate bitch!
  Nobody added Shota Aizawa and Hizashi Yamada
  Shota Aizawa: 
  ….what is this?
  Tired Slut changed Shota Aizawa’s name to Dadizawa
  Tired Slut changed Hizashi Yamada’s name to Loud Dad
  Dadizawa: 
  What?
  Loud Dad: 
  Judging by the chat name, I’d say that your class has added us to a group chat with them
  Loud Dad: 
  Awwwww, I’m a dad?
  Dadizawa: 
  Alright, who is who?
  Tired Slut: 
  Midoriya here. I always get the weirdest nicknames btw (｡◕‿◕｡)

  Comfy Rock:

  Dark Birb: 
  Tokoyami. What a mad banquet of darkness
  Loud Dad: 
  So what is this chat for?
  Nobody: 
  We all at first Midoriya made it for us to keep track of each other since we keep getting attacked, but slowly it morphed into a chat about how we’re concerned about him. Oh! And we can’t forget Zuzu

  Dadizawa:

  Pika Pika Pi: 
  Holy shit Aizawa just memed
  Loud Dad: 
  But seriously, who is that!?
  Tired Slut: 
  The demon that haunts my phone
  Tired Slut: 
  Don’t worry, he’s actually really nice
  Dadizawa: 
  Midoriya… why is that your name?
  Tired Slut: 
  Well, originally Kacchan changed my name to slut cause I’m dating the whole class, Zuzu, and Shinso, but that wouldn’t be right so I changed it to tired slut since I’m always tired
  Dadizawa: 
  ….
  Nobody: 
  Oh yeah! The reason I added you guys is because Midoriya is in the vents
  Dadizawa: 
  He’s what!?
  Tired Slut: [Image]
    Attached is an image of Midoriya laying in the vents with Shinso next to him. A hoard of snacks and beverages can be seen in the background
  Dadizawa: 
  Why…
  Loud Dad: 
  Your children are crazy Sho
  Pink!: 
  Hey! We’re your children too Mic!
  Dadizawa changed Tired Slut’s name to Problem Child #1
  Problem Child #1: 
  Oh hey, I’m actually number one at something! Take that Kacchan! 
  Problem Child #1:

  Pink! changed Problem Child #1’s name to Survivor
  The Creator: 
  I think Midoriya is the only person who I wouldn’t feel insulted about when they call me a bitch
  Pink!: 
  It’s because he’s like a puppy trying to act like a big guard dog
  Survivor: 
  But hey, since we already have Dadizawa and Loud Dad…
  Survivor added All Might
  Survivor changed All Might's name to Dad Might
  Dad Might:

  Pika Pika Pi: 
  IT'S DAD MIGHT!!!!
  Space Cadet:

  Nobody:

  Dad Might: 
  What's going on…?
  Dadizawa: 
  Midoriya made a group chat for class 1-A, but today they added you, Hizashi, and I. Scroll up for more context 
  Comfy Rock: 
  Wait. How far have you and Loud Dad scrolled up?
  Dadizawa: 
  All the way to the beginning, to Hizashi's instance. 
  Survivor: 
  Fuck. I did not think this through.
  Dad Might: 
  Young Midoriya! 
  Survivor: 
  Welp, time for me to yeet myself out the window. It was nice knowing you guys
  Loud Dad:
   I am very concerned. Especially about Zuzu
  Dad Might: 
  Just from what I've read so far I'm most concerned about young Midoriya 
  Tentacool: 
  Cause you're his dad
  Space Cadet changed Dad Might's name to Deku's Dad
  Deku's Dad: 
  What?
  Tails: 
  Don't we need a mom?
  Nobody: 
  We could always bring in Midoriya's mom~
  Survivor: 
  OH FUCK NO. I AM DRAWING THE LINE IN THE SAND. I WOULD DIE 1000000 TIMES OVER. MY MOM MUST NEVER SEE THIS CHAT OR ELSE THE WORLD WILL EXPLODE! WHY CAN'T WE BRING IN MIDNIGHT FOR OUR MOM!?
  Space Cadet: 
  Midnight is more like the drunk wine aunt
  Deku's Dad: 
  Excuse me, but what is a poly relationship? And who exactly is the Bakusquad? And what is yeet? 
  Dadizawa: 
  You really don't know? You need to get up to date with how kids talk.
  Comfy Rock: 
  Oh um! So, basically, me, Katsuki, Mina, Hanta, and Denki make up the Bakusquad. And poly means, well…
  Little Bitch: 
  We're all dating each other. 
  Little Bitch: 
  WHY THE FUCK IS MY NAME THIS AGAIN!? DEKU YOU BETTER START RUNNING!
  Survivor: 
  Uh oh (^^;)
  Survivor changed his name to Dead Boy
  Dead Boy: 
  Time to yeet away (~￣▽￣)~
  Flex Tape: 
  Hey, Katsuki, you know it's my turn to sleep with Midoriya today! Don't kill him!
  Dead Boy: 
  And I have been rescued by my tape hero
  Deku's Dad: 
  Um…
  Deku's Dad: 
  What do you mean by that young Sero?
  Burning Cold: 
  We take turns having Midoriya sleep in our rooms with us because it's the best way to get him to sleep. He's also very cuddly.
  Space Cadet: 
  If we dont, he ends up outside at 4 am burning sacrifices in your name and chanting ominously Dad Might
  Dead Boy: 
  It was only one time! (*´д｀*)
  Dark Birb: 
  Or on the roof 
  Nyoom: 
  Or running around outside 
  Dead Boy: 
  I feel so attacked right now ಥ ಥ
  Dead Boy: 
  On the other hand though, I actually have classmates who care about me and don't tell me to kill myself (・∀・ )
  The Creator: 
  Wait, what? Your classmates were telling you to kill yourself? 
  Dead Boy: 
  Yeah, but it's no big deal ( ಠ◡ಠ )
  Nyoom: 
  Did you tell your teachers?
  Dead Boy: 
  Nah, they hated me just as much. Doesn't matter though ( ಠ◡ಠ )
  Dadizawa: 
  They don't deserve to be called teachers. 
  Loud Dad: 
  What are their names? I just want to talk
  Comfy Rock: 
  Katsuki, didn't you go to the same middle school? Do you know who they are?
  Dead Boy: 
  No one really did it in front of Kacchan. Everyone was kinda scared of him. They knew he would punch them since he’s the only one who was allowed to pick on me, according to himself (ΘεΘ;)
  Space Cadet: 
  I… don’t know how to feel about that. And I'm also slightly jealous of Deku's emoji game right now
  Deku’s Dad: 
  Either way, I’m happy that you didn’t listen to them
  Pink!: 
  Alright, I need a lot of answers. First of all, please give me names Midoriya. Second, All Might, where did you meet Midoriya before UA? Cause like, the relationship you two have cannot be that strong if it was at the beginning of the school year.
  Dead Boy: 
  I don’t actually remember names. And he saved me from a sludge villain. AKA the same one that got Kacchan. All Might was so cool when he saved me! o(≧o≦)o
  Deku's Dad: 
  Unfortunately, the villain managed to escape when I rescued young Midoriya 
  Space Cadet: 
  Oh! That explains some things. And why dont you just call him your son!? He already told us that you did earlier!
  Deku's Dad: 
  ...(ΘεΘ;)
  Space Cadet: 
  YOU SHARED THE EMOJIS WITH ALL MIGHT BUT NOT ME!?
  Pika Pika Pi: 
  Top ten anime betrayals 
  Dead Boy: 
  ….(ΘεΘ;)
        Notes:
          Just remember, this fanfic is supposed to be crack
      Chapter 5: Is Midoriya Possessed?
        Notes:
          I'm so tired and I had to fight Zuzu to get control of my fic back

 Deku: Alrighty so… Deku: I need something, but no one can ask any questions ( ಠ◡ಠ ) Overwhelming Darkness: I am intrigued. Go on Deku: Does anyone happen to have 50 balloons, a bunch of knives, some sewing needles, and a bunch of velcro?

  12:33 PM
 Speedster: Is Izuku really still asleep? Tail: I mean, he did stay up till 2:30 am making an All Might statue.  Skeleton Dad: I'm still crying about it. It was so sweet of him (╥ ◡ ╥) SuperNova: Hey dad might wanna go ahead and send me that list of emojis Deku gave you? Skeleton Dad: I apologize, young Uraraka, but he made me promise not to Deku: I AM HERE AND AWAKE NOW Deku: You'll have to pry the list from my cold, dead hands Uraraka SuperNova: Darn. Btw, you can call me by my first name to. Honestly, I think you should be able to call everyone by their first names in our class since you're dating everyone  Pink Queen: I approve! And since I am queen, I have decided it for everyone  Duct Tape: All Hail Queen Mina! Sparky: Bow to the queen! Deku: Queen Mina forever! Boulder: Queen Mina for eternity!  SuperNova: All hail the queen! Tired Dad: Why are you all like this? Deku: Well, we are teenagers.

Hitoshi occasionally guest stars God of the Universe: Of course, there is also the Emosquad made up of Kyoka, Fumikage, Denki, and Mezo, guest staring Shoto Skeleton Dad: Oh! Are there any other squads? God of the Universe: Not to my knowledge… Tired Dad: Alright, who has weed in the dorms? God of the Universe: So that’s what that smell was Tentacool: I can’t smell it, so it’s not from the fourth floor Sanik: I can smell it, but it’s not super strong… Tired Dad: Then it’s coming from the second floor. Tired Dad: Mineta? Tokoyami? Ojiro? Grape Rush: Hey, Izuku is on this floor too! Everything: Like I said, Izuku could get away with murder even if he was standing over the body with a bloody knife. Plus, do you really think Izuku would be the one to be smoking weed? Grape Rush: Alright, fair enough, but it’s not me! I’m not even in the dorms. It’s my turn to go shopping, remember? And Ojiro and Aoyama are with me. Overwhelming Darkness: I’m in Kaminari’s room Sparky: Can confirm Tired Dad: It must be in the vents then… God of the Universe: I’ll help you search! Tired Dad: Alright 
  2:35 PM
 Tired Dad: Midoriya and I couldn’t find anything, but know I will be watching you all closely.  Screaming Dad: That’s weird! You're usually really good at finding that stuff. BUT PAY ATTENTION LISTENERS! WEED MAY BE LEGAL IN THE COUNTRY, BUT NOT AT THE SCHOOL! God of the Universe: To play devil's advocate, isn't this place kinda like our second home? And technically this isn't the school, just the dorms Tired Dad: ….I see your point, and I will talk to Nezu about it God of the Universe: (✿◠‿◠) God of the Universe:  Also! @Tired Dad @Skeleton Dad @Screaming Dad this is for you  https://youtu.be/XAxx-tepzPA  d(-_^) Tired Dad: Midoriya… wtf is this. It's the same thing over and over. It's ten minutes long  Screaming Dad: I feel so honored right now! Skeleton Dad: Thank you, Izukuヽ( T▽T )ノ Invisible: You know what? We need some female teachers in here. At least, the one we have

Also, very impressive statue Midoriya! You're very artistic! And I definitely want to meet Zuzu. Oh, and it's very cute how you all help Midoriya sleep! Sanik: How did you read the whole chat that fast? Drunk Wine Aunt: I have a talent for speed reading~! Tired Son: Izuku shares the chat with me whenever we hang out in the vents, so I already know everything  Icy Hot: Aizawa's name is Tired Dad God of the Universe: Shoto… Icy Hot: Shinso's name is Tired Son Tired Dad: And? Icy Hot: Is Shinso your secret love child?  Queen Mina: Here we go again Sanik: Shinso is not a secret love child! Though, he is Aizawa and Yamada's adoptive son. Invisible: How do you know this!? Sanik: They are best friends with my brother! We visit them sometimes, and they visit us. God of the Universe: Hey so… we need a fire extinguisher.  Tired Dad: Why? God of the Universe: Shoto's room is on fire Everything: I'm on my way! Tired Dad: God damnit  Drunk Whine Aunt: You know what?  
  Drunk Wine Aunt changed her name to Tired Slut
 Tired Slut: I am stealing this username Caramel Scented: What the fuck is going on? Queen Mina: Scroll up Babe Duct Tape: Our class is so chaotic  Sparky: Well, we are regularly attacked by villains, hang out with demons, and are teenagers. Of course we're going to be chaotic Boulder: He does have a point God of the Universe: Brb everyone, I'm going to yeet away for a while Skeleton Dad: Where are you going? God of the Universe: ─=≡Σ((( つ•̀ω•́)つ Tired Dad: WHERE ARE YOU GOING? SuperNova: He just ran out of the dorms Sanik: I am concerned! He usually gives us at least a hint of where he is going. Todoroki, Yaoyorozu, did he say anything to you two? Everything: After I put out the fire, Todoroki told him something, then Izuku said that he had an idea, then he ran away Icy Hot: I told him I needed to find out what other theories I have are real. I have no clue where he's going Tired Slut: And he has left the campus. Wow, he can really book it with his quirk! Tired Dad: If anyone finds out anything, let me know. I swear, I'm going to go gray because of all of you. Skeleton Dad: I'm sure that he'll be fine, right? After all, I doubt he is doing anything bad.  Screaming Dad: Yeah! He'll be fine! 
  5:49 PM
  God of the Universe added Dabi
  God of the Universe changed Dabi's name to Shoto's Long Lost Brother
 Shoto's Long Lost Brother: Sup Icy Hot: What. Tired Dad: What. Skeleton Dad: What. Screaming Dad: What. Caramel Scented: What. Tired Slut: What. Sanik: What. Everything: What. God of the Universe: What. Caramel Scented: WHY THE HELL ARE YOU SAYING WHAT WHEN YOU ADDED HIM!? AND WHY THE FUCK DID YOU ADD A VILLAIN?  Queen Mina: You know what? Even with all the crazy stuff we've been going through, I still never would have pictured this happening. Tired Dad: I just Tired Dad: Midoriya, you left campus without permission to go and talk to a villain who has tried to kill us? God of the Universe: UwU Sparky: YOU CAN NOT JUST UWU THIS AWAY! God of the Universe: Fine (╯3╰) God of the Universe: But I did it to prove that one of my theories was true Shoto's Long Lost Brother: Yup. It's true. I'm Shoto's oldest brother and son of Endeavor.  Icy Hot: Toya? Shoto's Long Lost Brother: Yup! Aka Dabi. Good to see that you got out of that burning trash's house. Now if only we could convince Fuyumi…  Shoto's Long Lost Brother: Anyway, I have to go now, but it was nice talking to you. Maybe we can talk more if the League attacks you guys again, which is definitely not going to be in a few weeks on the field trip we dont know that you guys are going on 
  Shoto's Long Lost Brother left the chat
 Icy Hot: Huh… Icy Hot: So my oldest brother is a villain God of the Universe: Anyway, I think proved my theory. I mean, he looked really similar to Endeavwhore and Shoto, plus he has fire powers and the same blue eyes so… Tired Dad: Midoriya, are you still near him? God of the Universe: Yeah. I'm kinda surrounded by the LoV right now. I think they're too stunned to attack me right now though? I mean, they're all kinda standing around just staring at me in disbelief  Caramel Scented: DEKU WHAT THE FUCK Sanik: I INSIST THAT YOU GET OUT OF THERE RIGHT AWAY Tired Dad: MIDORIYA LEAVE RIGHT NOW Tired Dad: AND SEND US YOUR LOCATION! God of the Universe: Aw, but we just started swapping theories about some villains and heroes from the past God of the Universe: And I mean, this isn't the first time that they've cornered me and stuff. They keep trying to recruit me, cause of my analytical skills or something. God of the Universe: But if I must, I'm on my way home now Tail: Alright, so, let me get this straight. Izuku found the LoV in a span of hours, got one of them into this chat to tell Todoroki that he was his brother, and then decided to sit and chat with the villains? And now he's just heading home like it's no big deal!? Skeleton Dad: Um. I think? I… I dont like to say this, but are all of us on a drug trip?  God of the Universe: No, it's true. They're kinda scared of me, honestly, so that helps Punk Rock: IM SORRY BUT WHAT THE FUCK DID IZUKU DO TO SCARE THE LOV? God of the Universe: (￣ω￣) Invisible: NO, WE NEED ANSWERS God of the Universe: ヾ(･├┬┴ Skeleton Dad: Young Izuku? Sparky: IZUKU WHAT DID YOU DO!? Tired Dad: You know what? I'm done. I can't deal with this shit anymore! Nothing in this chat makes any fucking sense!  Sanik: IZUKU YOU ARE CAUSING OUR TEACHER TO SWEAR. FUCK, I'M SWEARING TOO! JUST WHAT DID YOU DO Queen Mina: Holy shit, Izuku made Iida and Aizawa swear! I never thought this day would come! And certainly not because of Izuku! 
  Duct Tape changed God of the Universe's name to Scary Boy

          Izuku? Being kidnapped by the LoV? More likely than you'd think!

  10:12 AM
  Tired Dad: 
  Alright, where are all of you? I always hear at least a couple of you moving around in the common area by now. 
  SuperNova: 
  We have Izuku taped to his door and all of us are sitting in front of him
  Skeleton Dad:
   I’m probably going to regret asking this, but why?
  Queen Mina: 
  We’re trying to get him to tell us what exactly he did to scare the LoV
  Screaming Dad: 
  I mean...Nezu is also curious, so let us know if you find out
  Boulder: 
  I’m honestly scared at how long he can hold out like this
  Tired Son: 
  What are you guys going to do when he needs to go to the bathroom?
  Duct Tape: 
  That’s the only thing we are allowing him down for, because we honestly believe he would rather soil himself then tell us
  Invisible: 
  Which makes us want to know even more!
  Tired Son: 
  You know what? I’m on my way over. This sounds interesting
  SuperNova: 
  Right now he’s making an All Might face to deter us. He thinks that it’ll be that easy
  Tired Dad: 
  All Might face?

  Sparky: 
  Alright, now I am starting to rethink this
  Scary Boy: 
  Let them have their fun Zuzu~! They’ll get tired of this eventually
  Caramel Scented: 
  What the fuck!? How are you typing when you are literally taped to the door!?
  Scary Boy: 
  I can type without looking (✿◠‿◠)
  Screaming Dad: 
  I suggest letting Midoriya go beFORE THE DEMON MAKES GOOD ON HIS THREATS!
  Sparky: 
  I'M TRYING BUT THEY WON'T LET ME
  Overwhelming Darkness: 
  I barely sleep, so good luck with that Zuzu
  Tired Son: 
  That's a whole mood right there. Btw, can I join the EmoSquad?
  Overwhelming Darkness: 
  Fine by me. 
  @Sparky @Tentacool @Punk Rock @Icy Hot
  Sparky: 
  Cool with me
  Tentacool: 
  I dont care either way
  Punk Rock: 
  I'm fine with it
  Icy Hot: 
  Same as Shoji
  Tired Son: 
  Cool
  Tired Son: 
  Btw, how did you find the LoV last night Izuku?
  Scary Boy: 
  I don't know. Sometimes I just wander around and I bump into them.
  Human Car: 
  Izuku… just how often have you seen the LoV?
  Scary Boy: 
  Around once a week at this point? 50% of the time they try to recruit me, 25% of the time we play board games and card games, 18% of the time we talk about hero and villain theories, 5% of the time they try to attack me (mostly Toga, but sometimes Shigaraki if I call him Hand Job), and the other 2% we just nod at each other and go our separate ways. It's a real gamble every time I go outside. 
  Tired Dad: 
  And you didn't think to tell anyone about this?
  Scary Boy: 
  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I've been too curious to see where this weird relationship goes.
  Screaming Dad: 
  Honestly? I'm a little curious now too
  Scary Boy: 
  And on the bright side, I talked them out of attacking UA several times now. It's been very easy to convince them since… the incident (¬_¬)
  Invisible: 
  WHAT WAS THE INCIDENT!?
  Scary Boy: 
  It's too embarrassing (╯3╰)
  Icy Hot: 
  You know what…
  Icy Hot added Shoto's Long Lost Brother 
  Icy Hot: 
  How did Izuku manage to scare you all?
  Shoto's Long Lost Brother: 
  Well, you see….
  Scary Boy: 
  (✿◠‿◠)
  Shoto's Long Lost Brother: 
  I would love to tell you all, but I don't want to become victim number two. See ya
  Shoto's Long Lost Brother left the chat
  Icy Hot: 
  Welp, I'm out of ideas. My brother left just like how he left all those years ago
  Scary Boy: 
  Can I be let down now?
  Queen Mina: 
  No! Not until you tell us
  Skeleton Dad: 
  How is it possible that young Izuku is like this? When I met him, he seemed like an honest, hardworking person who only dreamed of helping people and now… now he's terrifying both heroes and villains alike and worries me half to death…
  Scary Boy: 
  I'm sorry Dad! I didn't mean to disappoint you щ(ಥДಥщ)
  Scary Boy: 
  Would you be less disappointed if I give up my secret on why the LoV are scared of me? (╯3╰)
  Skeleton Dad: 
  Yes, I would be less disappointed 
  Scary Boy: 
  Alright! So, the random meetings thing started after the Hosu thing. It was really weird, and at first things were tense, but then the more it happened the more relaxed it was when it happened. Then the little shits kidnapped Kacchan. The day after we got Kacchan back, I found them and did… things. They've been scared of me ever since!
  Queen Mina: 
  Honestly? That didn't really answer anything. 
  Skeleton Dad: 
  I am still a little disappointed 
  Scary Boy: 
  Σ(゜ロ゜;) Noooooo
  Scary Boy: 
  Alright, so to elaborate on things…
  Scary Boy added Shoto's Long Lost Brother 
  Scary Boy: 
  I'm too embarrassed! You tell them (*_ _)人
  Shoto's Long Lost Brother: 
  Ok, so we were chilling in one of our new hideouts, right? And Hand Job was kinda having a mental break down cause you guys captured who was kind of his father figure/teacher? All of the sudden, the door was kicked down and Midoriya walked in and full out glared at us. He yelled at us for kidnapping the Blasty guy, and gave us a full blown lecture about it too. Like, seriously, he lectured us for hours about how it was wrong to kidnap his friend. I didn't even know someone had that lung capacity 
  Invisible: 
  So you're scared of him because he lectured you guys for a while?
  Shoto's Long Lost Brother: 
  He was doing an All Might face the whole time too. But no, we're scared of him cause he took down Muscular and beat all of our asses in a matter of seconds. 
  Scary Boy: 
  UwU
  Skeleton Dad: 
  I...I was not expecting that. 
  Sparky: 
  Were any of us, really?
  Punk Rock: 
  Ok, am I the only one wondering what he means by an All Might face?
  Punk Rock:
   Nvm, Izuku just demonstrated for us. 
  Caramel Scented: 
  HOW THE FUCK DID THE NERD BEAT THE LOV TO A PULP IN SECONDS?
  Shoto’s Long Lost Brother: 
  We aren’t even sure, to be honest, which kinda makes us more scared of him. Anyway, I gotta go. Hand Job is getting angsty again
  Shoto’s Long Lost Brother left the chat
  Queen Mina: 
  I guess we have our answers now? And we now know not to fuck with Izuku
  Icy Hot: 
  Not that any of us were going to mess with him, right?
  Duct Tape: 
  Yeah, but she’s just saying that even more so, we shouldn’t fuck with Izuku
  Caramel Scented: 
  I bet it’s just a hoax! Deku just made a second account and is fucking with us
  Tired Son: 
  Honestly? I'm more likely to believe that Izuku really is meeting up with the LoV every week.
  SuperNova: 
  Deku? Where are you going?
  Skeleton Dad: 
  You let him down?
  SuperNova: 
  Yeah, but as soon as we did he sprinted away
  Scary Boy: 
  I gotta take care of some things! I'll be back in a bit 
  Tired Dad: 
  Midoriya, please, I'm begging you, tell us where you are going!
  Scary Boy: 
  Alright… there's a group of cats that live near my old apartment that I give food and water to every day. My mom has taken over since I couldn't, but she's on a business trip and Kacchan's parents are too busy today, so I gotta do it today!
  Tired Dad: 
  Oh… can I join you?
  Tired Son: 
  Me too. I'm already at the gates
  Tree: 
  Me too please 
  Scary Boy: 
  Alright! I'm waiting with Hitoshi by the gates
  Invisible: 
  You know, with everything going on, that is surprisingly wholesome 
  Icy Hot: 
  Izuku will always be the class cinnamon roll
  Invisible: 
  True…
  2:10 PM
  Tired Dad: 
  Are any of you allergic to cats?
  Glitter for All: 
  Non
  Queen Mina: 
  Nope!
  Kermit the Frog: 
  I'm not too fond of cats, but I'm not allergic 
  Human Car:
   I do not have an allergy to cats
  SuperNova:
   Nope, but I've never been able to have one cause my mom is allergic 
  Tail: 
  No
  Sparky: 
  Not at all!
  Boulder: 
  Nope
  Master of Sweets: 
  No
  Tentacool:
   No
  Punk Rock: 
  No allergies here 
  Duct Tape: 
  I don't 
  Overwhelming Darkness: 
  I, like Tsu, do not enjoy the company of cats unless they are black cats. I am not allergic though 
  Icy Hot: 
  I don't think so
  Invisible:
   I don't have any allergies! 
  Caramel Scented: 
  No
  Grape Rush: 
  Not me, which is good since my mom has a few
  Everything: 
  I am not allergic either, fortunately 
  Tired Dad: 
  Good, because the dorm is getting some cats
  Scary Boy: 
  By some he means a lot! (^▽^)
  Tree: 
  o(≧ω≦)o
  SuperNova: 
  Am I the only one you aren't going to share your emojis with?
  Scary Boy: 
  (ΘεΘ;)
  Human Car: 
  Wait, what do you mean by that? 
  Tired Son: 
  Basically your dorm is adopting all of Izuku's stray cats. We already got permission from Nezu
  Tired Dad: 
  Oh, that reminds me. You are all allowed to smoke marijuana in the dorms now, as long you use it safely and don't come to class high
  Scary Boy changed his name to Izuwu
  Duct Tape: 
  NO!
  Duct Tape changed Izuwu's name to Sunshine
  Duct Tape: 
  There
  Sunshine: 
  Ok. Btw, we're here with the cats
  10:12
  SuperNova: 
  Alright, so Deku is sleeping with me, right? Well, as soon as he entered my room, an army of cats followed him in. Throughout the night, I've been letting in so many cats. In conclusion, when you have your turn with Deku, you also get a lot of cats.
  Icy Hot: 
  Some of them are curled against my left side.
  Tired Dad: 
  And I probably have the rest in my room for the night
  Tentacool: 
  I will look forward to that tomorrow then 
  7:13 AM
  SuperNova: 
  Hey, has anyone seen Deku?
  Boulder: 
  I haven't, why?
  SuperNova: 
  He was gone when I woke up
  Human Car: 
  I have not seen him either!
  Skeleton Dad: 
  Young Izuku is missing?
  Everything: 
  I can't find him
  Grape Rush: 
  He's not in the boys bathroom
  Tired Dad: 
  Fuck. 
  @Sunshine
  , are you there?
  Sunshine: 
  Oh, hello!
  Sunshine: 
  SO, IT TURNS OUT I WAS KIDNAPPED LAST NIGHT BY KUROGIRI FOR ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO GET ME TO JOIN THEM
  Sunshine: 
  I’m on my way back now, but I’m definitely going to be late to class.
  Skeleton Dad: 
  Are you alright!? I’ll come pick you up!
  Sunshine: 
  That would probably be best since I’m covered in blood
  Screaming Dad: 
  Is… is it your blood?
  Sunshine: 
  Nope
  Tired Dad: 
  Whose blood is it? 
  Sunshine: 
  No clue
  Skeleton Dad: 
  Where are you?
  Sunshine: 
  Hosu. Two heroes are talking to me right now. They’re going to take me to UA, so you don’t need to worry Dad
  Skeleton Dad: 
  Which heroes?
  Sunshine: 
  Kaumi Woods and Mt. Lady. They were in Hosu on a date I think?
  Skeleton Dad: 
  Alright, I trust them… Tell me as soon as you get here!
  Sunshine: 
  Will do!
  1:25 PM
  Sunshine: 
  I’m back! 
  Skeleton Dad: 
  We are at Ground Beta! Please meet us there at once if you are uninjured
  Sunshine: 
  Alright!
  4:38 PM
  Grape Rush: 
  Alright, please tell me I’m not the only one that’s going to have nightmares tonight
  Sparky: 
  You are not the only one dude
  Sunshine: 
  Why are you going to have nightmares?
  Grape Rush: 
  WHY? WHY!? BECAUSE YOU SHOWED UP TO CLASS COVERED IN BLOOD AND WITH A BLOODY KNIFE!
  Punk Rock: 
  I’m going to have to agree with Mineta on this one.
  Tired Son: 
  Wait, what? 
  Screaming Dad: 
  WHAT
  Tired Dad: 
  I… what
  Sunshine: 
  In my defense, I forgot I was holding the knife. Plus, All Might said to come to class right away if I wasn’t injured, and I did say I was covered in blood  ╮(─▽─)╭
  Skeleton Dad: 
  Didn’t Kamui or Mt. Lady think about getting you cleaned up before they brought you back????
  Sunshine: 
  They just put a towel on my seat and said that it was your guys’ problem
  Tired Dad: 
  The next time I see those two…
  Boulder: 
  I honestly thought I was going to die for a split second there
  SuperNova: 
  Hey, Deku, you didn’t...kill the LoV, did you?
  Sunshine:  
  ((((゜д゜;)))) Of course not! I would never kill anyone! I only did what was needed to escape
  Tentacool: 
  Hey, Izuku, I put down an extra futon for you tonight. You can come to my room whenever
  Sunshine:
   ´ ▽ ` )ﾉ Thank you Mezo! Btw, come by my room right now if you want that good green stuff
 Skeleton Dad: Green stuff? Sunshine: Weed, dad, weed. 
        Notes:
          Izuku has the good stuff
      Chapter 8: Lots of Green. Oh, Hi Dabi!
        Notes:
          Woot! New chapter! The first update to this fic of the year! Let me tell you though. I don't really edit this, since it's crack and group chats, so it's natural for there to be typing mistakes. However, going through and bolding and centering everything takes forever (╥_╥)
            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)

  Tuesday 6:38 AM
Queen Mina: Damn Izuku, you really do have some good stuff! That's like, the best I've ever had!Sunshine: (≧ω≦)Boulder: The Bakusquad ended up having an impromptu sleepover because of it lol.

I refuse to participate in using any drugs!Sunshine: But marijuana has been proven to have no long term effects, and it does different things depending on what you want. I could give you some that would help you relax, stuff to boost your creativity, stuff to get you more motivated, etc. Human Car: Is that so? Alright, I might try it after I do some research! SuperNova: We'll both try it for the first time Iida!Icy Hot: It'll probably make my father mad. I'm in.Kermit the Frog: I'm up for it.Sunshine: Awesome! Any of the teachers wanna join?Tired Slut: I have to declineScreaming Dad: No thanks Tired Dad: You know what? Sure. I've been so stressed out because all of you, so I need something to take the edge off.Skeleton Dad: I've never tried weed…Sunshine: Join us! You won't regret it~! Plus, it would probably do you a lot of goodSkeleton Dad: Ok…Boulder: Did Izuku just get Iida, Aizawa, and All Might to agree to smoke with him?Sparky: I'm jealous of his power
  Tuesday 11:39 AM
Sunshine: Hey so uh…Tired Son: We're stuckHuman Car: Stuck? Stuck where?Sunshine: On the roof. We decided to take a nap in the sun, and when we woke up, the roof door was lockedSuperNova: Which roof exactly? Duct Tape: Uraraka and I can get you down!Sunshine: Roof 3Tired Son: Nvm, dad got us. Thanks though

Especially if it's the LoVQueen Mina: Will do lol
  Tuesday 4:50 PM
Skeleton Dad: Omg, I turned into a skeleton!Everything: Pardon?Sunshine: Lmao that’s why you’re my skeleton dadHuman Car: Am I going to turn into a car? Are my decendents going to turn int o cars? What if my children have engines in their arms and legs, and it gets more and more car like as time goes on and boom, one of my gret great great grandchildren pop out a car?Punk Rock: So this is what the class rep is like when he’s highSuperNova: I make things float! I feel floaty! Float float float!Queen Mina: Oh man, this is great! Someone, record them for me!Tired Dad: You all are such little shits, but you’re my little shits. Tired Slut: I wish I was there to record them!Screaming Dad: Don’t worry, I’m recording!Tired Slut: You are awesome Hizashi!Tired Son: I think I lost my hair and it’s been replaced by cloudsCaramel Scented: This is fucking hilarious. How are you doing @Icy Hot?Icy Hot: I’m buying Izuku a bunch of stuff using my father’s credit cardSparky: Fucking mintDuct Tape: I hope they’re still high by the time we get backCaramel Scented: Based off of Deku’s stuff, there’s a high fucking chanceKermit the Frog: I need to go to the lake to be with my own kind. But I’m stuck on the ceiling for some reasonTired Son: My dad’s are kissing and that’s so gayTired Dad: You’re gay too you little shitTired Son: Oh shit, I amTired Son: Izu, I think I’m gay for youIcy Hot: We’re all gay for IzukuSuperNova: But the girls are straight for Deku!Skeleton Dad: My son has so many girlfriends and boyfriends! I’m so proud of him!Screaming Dad: So, All Might is hugging Midoriya while crying, Todoroki is laying on the ceiling ordering things on his phone, Asui is trying to swim through the air, Uraraka is spacing out and making more things float, Iida is having an existential crisis over whether he is more car or human, and Shota is helping Hitoshi cope with the fact that he is really gay for Midoriya!Punk Rock: Alright, I have to see thisTail: They’re making a lot of noise…Glitter for All: It is amusing to watch, though
  Wednesday 6:30 AM
Skeleton Dad: Is it normal to feel like there is cotton in your mouth after getting high?Sunshine: Yup! Just drink some water, maybe chew on something mint flavoredTired Son: Izuku, your stuff is the best I’ve ever had. Where do you get it?Sunshine: (•⊙ω⊙•) SecretTired Dad: ...there are twenty-three packages addressed for Midoriya at the gates. Icy Hot: Oh, those must be the things I ordered. I forgot exactly what I got…Sunshine: Why did you get me 23 things?Icy Hot: Cause I wanted to, I thinkHuman Car: I am slightly ashamed by how I acted and yet… I felt so relaxed even though I was contemplating weird ideas.Punk Rock: It was really fun watching you guys thoughSuperNova: I would definitely do that again! I felt so good! Even if I feel a little nauseous from overusing my quirkKermit the Frog: I woke up in the bath?Everything: You kept trying to leave to go to a lake, so we convinced you the bath was a lake Kermit the Frog: OhQueen Mina: I definitely had fun watching you guys!  Sunshine: OMG SHOTO YOU ARE THE BESTSunshine: (｡♥‿♥｡)Boulder: What did he do?Sunshine: HE GOT ME A BUNCH OF HERO MERCHANDISE!

  Wednesday 6:28 PM
Tired Dad: Alright, this chat has been too quiet today. What have you guys gotten into this time?SuperNova: For once I think we're good. The only way I think trouble might pop up is from Bakugou, Todoroki, and Deku going shopping…Sunshine: ALRIGHT, SO, I SORTA KINDA HAVE A SERVANT NOW? ヽ(๏∀๏ )ﾉSuperNova: See? I knew it was going to be one of them.Tired Dad: What do you mean you have a servant?Sunshine: You see, we ran into the LoV as we were on our way to the store and it was one of those times we ended up playing cards, only this time Shoto and Kacchan ended up playing too. Anyway, I was on a losing streak, so Shigaraki bet me Dabi that he would win, and I bet myself that I would win cause really, I had to win at some point, right? Well, as it turned out, I won so now I have Dabi (⊙﹏⊙✿)Tired Dad: You just...have a villainSunshine: I was going to give him back, but Shoto wanted to keep him. We have the groceries and we're on our way back, but I don't know where he's going to sleep ¯\_(ツ)_/¯Tired Dad: You’re bringing him back here!?Sunshine: Well, yeah? Icy Hot: He can sleep in my roomSunshine: Ok!Tired Dad: God damnit… fine, but you’re in charge of himSunshine: (°∀°)bScreaming Dad: Seriously Sho?Tired Slut: Can we really condone this?Skeleton Dad: Can we really say no to Izuku?Tired Slut: ToucheHuman Car: Izuku! Why were you playing games when you were supposed to go shopping!? And why would you agree to betting yourself!? What if the LoV won!?Sunshine: Tenya Tenya Tenya. Do you really think that the LoV would be able to keep me for long? ｡◕ ‿ ◕｡Grape Rush: I’m scared to know what Izuku is trying to imply Punk Rock: Considering he’s escaped them once when they kidnapped him, I’d say he’s implying that he can get away easily. Sunshine: Oh, they’ve kidnapped me more than once! They just never seem to learn…Everything: What!? When!?Sunshine: Oh, that reminds me…
  Sunshine added Shoto’s Long Lost Brother
  Shoto’s Long Lost Brother changed his name to Izuku’s Slave
Izuku’s Slave: I guess I’m chilling with you guys for a while. And don’t worry, I’m not stupid enough to try and attack you guys while Izuku is thereDuct Tape: Nevermind Aizawa I guess?Izuku’s Slave: I could take down everyone but Izuku in your dormsSunshine: I’d say that Aizawa could take you. He’s a ninja! Queen Mina: OMG EVERYONE SHUT UP AND STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING! I JUST USED HANTA’S TAPE TO WAX MY LEGS, AND IT WORKED SO WELLPunk Rock: Really? I might try it then…Glitter for All: Sero, I will be in touch soon!Tail: Um, back to the villain that is now in the dorms?Sunshine: Don’t worry he’s not going to hurt anyone! He’s just… well, I don’t really know what he’s going to do. He’s technically my servant now, but I don’t really know what to have him do… (￣。￣)Izuku’s Slave: I could rob people for youSunshine: No! No villainy while you are my servant. Izuku’s Slave: I could make you meals?Sunshine: Oh, that actually sounds pretty nice… and you could be my sparring partner sometimes when everyone else gets too tired!Izuku’s Slave: As long as you go easy, then sure. Again, I don’t want to be victim number twoSparky: What do you mean by victim number two?Caramel Scented: OH SHITSunshine: It appears that Dabi has just fainted! Unfortantually, he will not be able to answer your question UwUIcy Hot: But you just hvjuyfiloSunshine: Oh would you look at that! Shoto just fainted as well. It must run in the family. Do you have anything to add, Katsuki Bakugou, Mashirao Ojiro (•⊙ω⊙•)Tail: NopeCaramel Scented: I didn’t see anythingSunshine: Good, good. Invisible: I just realized i missed my turn with Izuku! You're sleeping with me tonight!Sunshine: Oh yeah! I'll make sure to be there later!
  Thursday 1:20 AM
Sunshine: Ok, listen, Toru's bed is so soft it feels like I'm laying on a cloudInvisible: What can I say, I like cute and soft things! Caramel Scented: GO TO SLEEP Sunshine: Dont tell me how to live my life!Z̴̦͎̲͈̪̤̙͖͂͋̇u̵̡͍̱̫̠͆̿̉͂͊̽̚͘z̶̤̓u̶̢̐̐̆͋̅̋:̷̣̜̭̘͎͖̺̑̋̏̄̚ ̴̝̯̠́̾́̚S̴̝̖̜̙͓͔̭̔̎̾̎͊̕l̵̡̞̭̹̞͓̥̤̈́̌̇̚e̷̻̮͖͍̭̰̫̽̎͠͝e̶̥̭͖͙̪̙̲͌̐͛͋͋̈ṕ̶̗͇͇́̎̓̃͘͠͠ ̵̯͚͈̼̪̜̺̩̋̈̍̎͌͝Sunshine: Ok!

      Chapter 9: There Are Other Chats??????
        Notes:
          Ok, listen. I know that this chapter was supposed to be out over two weeks ago at this point, but in my defense, it seems like the universe did not want me to get this chapter out. First I had a power outage that went on longer than expected, then I started a new job which took a lot of my energy, and THEN I got so sick I had to miss work and I only had the energy to sleep and watch tv. Finally though, this chapter is done, and you are now about to read the chapter that the universe did not want you guys to read.

  Thursday 7:00 AM
  Grape Rush: 
  So what what is Dabi going to do while we're at class?
  Izuku's Slave: 
  I'll probs just clean up or some shit ╮(─▽─)╭
  SuperNova: 
  Everyone but me, huh?
  Sunshine: 
  I can explain? ((((゜д゜;))))
  SuperNova: 
  Well, guess what bitch? Someone pointed out that I can copy and paste!
  SuperNova:  
  (╹◡╹)凸 (•⊙ω⊙•)
  Sunshine: 
  Oh! Cool. I was wondering when you would figure that out
  Izuku’s Slave: 
  Anyone want me to clean their rooms while I’m at it? I’m going to be bored since it doesn’t take me long to clean things.
  Sunshine: 
  Well, since you’re offering…
  Icy Hot: 
  How do you know how to clean? We had a maid?
  Izuku’s Slave: 
  Hand Job made me clean up with Kurogiri since I kept calling him Hand Job. 
  Sunshine: 
  Ah, classic Hand Job
  Invisible: 
  Can you clean my room too?
  Invisible changed her name to Incognito
  Grape Rush: 
  And mine!
  Queen Mina: 
  Mine too!
  Sparky: 
  Ooh, and mine!
  Human Car: 
  Why is everyone so comfortable with letting a villain enter their room!?
  Izuku's Slave: 
  Like I said, I'm not going to do anything to make Izuku mad. He may not kill anyone, but there are worse things people can do
  Sunshine: 
  (╯3╰) I wouldn't physically hurt you, depending on what you do. Why do you keep saying things like that?
  Tired Dad: 
  You better hurry up and get to class
  Staff Chat 
  7:49 AM
  Tired Slut: [Image]
    Attached is a screenshot of Class 1-A, the chatroom we normally read.
  Tired Slut: 
  The kids of 1-A are so adorable yet worrying at the same time. It's impressive 
  Ninja: 
  They're going to be the death of me
  Principal: 
  They certainly are a chaotic bunch. Imagine, a UA student constantly running into the LoV and even gaining one of them as a servant! And that same UA student has apparently scared the LoV so much that they try not to anger him. 
  Loud Screaming: 
  I'm still surprised you're letting Dabi stay
  Principal: 
  I'm curious about the full extent of Midoriya's relationship with the LoV and I plan on figuring that out through Dabi.
  Principal: 
  Plus, from what info we have gathered so far, Dabi shouldn't be a threat as long as Midoriya is here.
  All Mighty: 
  If you're sure that it is fine, then I will let it be.
  Sniper: 
  Y'all are crazy in my opinion, and class 1-A is even crazier

  11:00 AM
  Dad Might: 
  Izuku my boy, Zuzu has started to enter other chats that you are not in
  Son Might: 
  I’ll have a talk with him, but I doubt that will change anything. He gets bored.
  Dad Might: 
  As long as you try ´ ▽ ` )ﾉ
  Dad Might: 
  Also, I am planning on visiting your mother later today. Do you know what her favorite movie is?
  Son Might: 
  She loves Disney, so any of those is good. Moana is a good choice
  Dad Might: 
  Thank you for the information!
  Class 1-B

  Have you guys heard? Apparently 1-A has a villain staying in their dorms! How haughty are they to claim that they can control a villain that has attacked them multiple times!

  League of Villains 
  2:34 PM
  Hands: 
  Dabi, when are you going to come back?
  Blue Flame: 
  Don't know. I don't want to piss Izuku off, so I'm not leaving until he says I can
  Warp: 
  This is why you shouldn't have bet Dabi
  Cute Mosquito: 
  Why couldn't you have bet me!? I wish I was there instead of Dabi T-T
  Blue Flame: 
  Pretty sure you wouldn't have been allowed here. The only reason I got in was because I'm Shoto's brother
  Hands: 
  At least use this opportunity to get some information 
  Blue Flame: 
  I can only stay in the class 1-A dorm unless being supervised by Izuku. So unless you want to know that Izuku keeps a huge stash of weed or that the invisible girl has a stuffed animal obsession, then we're out of luck. Oh, I did also learn that everyone takes turns with having Izuku sleep in their beds or else he turns into an insomniac nightmare that builds shrines to All Might, makes sacrifices in his name, and goes overall crazy.
  Hands: 
  That last part could be useful…
  Two for One: 
  I wish I was there!
  Two for One:
   No I don't! 
  Stain Fanboy: 
  Anyone else need anything while I'm out?
  Magnetic: 
  I need some more gummy bears
  Warp: 
  We need more alcoholic beverages. Mostly margarita mixes and bourbon. 
  Stain Fanboy:

  5:28 PM
  Icy Hot: 
  So, Izuku. 
  Sunshine: 
  Yes?
  Icy Hot: 
  Your fight with Mirio got me thinking today. You're a really good strategist, right?
  Sunshine: 
  I'd say so, yes
  Queen Mina: 
  Izuku could probably out think us all
  Icy Hot: 
  If you're such a good strategist, then could you come up with a way to defeat any of us?
  Sunshine: 
  Like I haven’t already (✿◠‿◠)
  Caramel Scented: 
  Then why have I’ve always beaten you Shitty Nerd?
  Sunshine: 
  Kacchan… 
  Sunshine: 
  Do you really think I’ve fought you seriously yet?
  Caramel Scented: 
  WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN!?
  Izuku’s Slave: 
  Have you not listened to me when I said that he easily brought down the entire league in seconds? I’d say he could have taken down All Might in his prime if he really wanted to. Izuku is a scary little shit. 
  Icy Hot: 
  Then why do you let yourself lose???
  Sunshine: 
  Cause I like seeing people happy when they win!
  Everything: 
  Aww, Izuku! That is a nice reason, but still, we should always do our best! That way we can train even better.
  Sunshine: 
  I can’t use all of my power or else I’ll break my bones, but I’ll always try to do my best without using it all! 
  Tired Dad: 
  You say that, yet I can no longer count on my hands how many times you have broken your bones.
  Sunshine: 
  (=ω=;)
  Bakusquad &lt;3
  5:40 PM
  Queen Mina: 
  Bakubae, I have a question for you
  King: 
  What
  Queen Mina: 
  Why do you fight so much with Izuku?
  King: 
  Cause he’s always looking down on me! 
  Electric Boogaloo: 
  But he’s not? He’s always praising you so much that I thought he was into you at first. Turns out he’s just like that but still
  Duct Tape: 
  Yeah! He’s such a sweet guy. Until he goes crazy at night…
  Rock: 
  How does he look down on you?
  King: 
  He just…
  King: 
  One time when we were young and I just got my quirk, I was leading a group of friends and Deku around in the woods. When we were crossing over a large stream, I slipped and fell off of the log we were using to cross. Everyone just asked if I was fine, which I was, except for Deku. He came down to the stream and offered me his hand. Back then, he didn’t have his quirk. It just seemed like he was looking down on me, someone who had an awesome quirk, while he himself didn’t have it yet. Looking back, it was so stupid. He just wanted to help me up. But ever since then, part of my brain keeps telling me that he’s looking down on me cause… he is better.
  Queen Mina: 
  Babe…
  Rock: 
  That’s really manly of you to admit!
  Duct Tape: 
  I didn’t know you felt that way
  Electric Boogaloo: 
  Are you going to tell him?
  King: 
  Fuck no! There is no way in hell I’m telling that to Deku!
  Queen Mina to Broccoli 
  5:55 PM
  Queen Mina: [Image] 
    Attached is a screenshot of the Bakusquad &lt;3 chat
  Broccoli: 
  Aww, I always suspected that. 
  Broccoli: 
  Thanks Mina
  Queen Mina: 
  No problem! &lt;3
  Queen Mina: 
  Pls don’t tell Bakubae that I told you though or else I won’t get cuddles for a week at least!
  Broccoli: 
  Don’t worry, I won’t!
        Notes:
          So yeah, this chapter was requested quite a bit with people wanting to see other chats. More chats will pop up in the future, but for now, I'm going to focus mostly on Class 1-A.Also, yes, Big Sis Magne is still alive as of this moment but, well... soon a lot will change.
      Chapter 10: izuku is going to murders someone. aizawa is not going to stop him
        Notes:
          So... I'm bad at updating. Huh.

  It’s been 15 days since I’ve started this group chat. 
  Sunshine: 
  Also, Koji’s bunny keeps chewing on my hair in between sleeping in it.
  Caramel Scented: 
  Go to bed nerd!
  Caramel Scented changed his name to Explosions
  Sunshine changed his name to Alphabet Boy
  Alphabet Boy: 
  Fine
  Friday 6:38 AM
  Queen Mina: 
  It’s only been 15 days!!!!?????
  Sparky: 
  It seems like it’s been so much longer lol
  SuperNova: 
  Alphabet Boy?
  Alphabet Boy: 
  I’ve been listening to Melanie Martinez a lot lately
  Explosions: 
  Wouldn’t Cry Baby fit you more?
  Alphabet Boy: 
  I’ve already had a name like that, Kacchan. I have to change it up
  Skeleton Dad: 
  Melanie Martinez? I’ve never heard of her
  Alphabet Boy: 
  Her songs are kinda depressing, just warning you if you want to listen to her
  Explosions: 
  Yeah. Especially Sippy Cup
  Duct Tape: 
  Izuku and Katsuki agreeing on something? More likely than you’d think!
  Explosions: 
  Fuck off!
  Duct Tape: 
  Maybe later ;)
  Tired Dad: 
  no
  Skeleton Dad: 
  Please don’t
  Screaming Dad: 
  There are teachers in this chat! 
  Tired Slut: 
  Just make sure to use protection
  Tired Dad: 
  MIDNIGHT
  Queen Mina: 
  I’m wheezing
  Sparky: 
  I’m dead XD
  Human Car: 
  There will be no sexual intercourse inside of the dorms!
  SuperNova: 
  Just inside the dorms?
  Sparky: 
  What about outside of the dorms~?
  Alphabet Boy: 
  Aww, but I thought we were going to have fun tonight Tenya~!
  Master of Sweets: 
  I think Iida just froze? He’s bright red and just staring at his phone with a mixture of disappointment and disgust
  Alphabet Boy: 
  It was just a joke Tenya! At least, I was joking. Can’t say for the others
  Tired Dad: 
  I will expel you all
  Friday 11:46 AM
  Queen Mina: 
  Was the sex ed special lesson really necessary?? I think Koda and Izuku were traumatized
  Alphabet Boy: 
  I’ll never be able to unsee what I’ve just seen
  Tired Dad: 
  This is what you guys get if you’re going to make jokes about it
  Alphabet Boy: 
  I will never make a joke about it again
  Sparky: 
  I can’t say the same
  Explosions: 
  Pikachu, you better not be the reason we have to go through another one of those!
  Sparky: 
  What are you going to do? Explosion murder me? While I’m hiding with Izuku?
  Alphabet Boy: 
  Why are you dragging me into this ((((゜д゜;))))
  Explosions: 
  Deku where is Denki? He needs to have a special lesson with my fists
  Alphabet Boy: 
  Well, Hanta and Eijiro are offering me All Might stuff in order to not reveal where we’re hiding.
  Explosions: 
  WTF? Do you have Mina with you too????
  Alphabet Boy:
   Uh… yeah
  Skeleton Dad: 
  Izuku, I can get you any merch you like, if you want. I have a copy of every piece of my merch that was made 
  Duct Tape: 
  Uh, I think you broke him? He’s muttering like crazy and looks like a crazy fanboy
  SuperNova: 
  Well, All Might did just basically offer him what equals to a dragon’s hoard to Deku
  Explosions: 
  Where the fuck are you guys!?
  Alphabet Boy: 
  Well, I can’t really tell you unless you do something. Mina said to tell you that.
  Queen Mina: 
  You have to tell Izuku that you love him!
  Explosions: 
  WHAT THE FUCK
  SuperNova: 
  I want to hear that!
  Queen Mina: 
  In the chat. No deleting. Only then, will Izuku give us up and release us back to you
  Alphabet Boy: 
  But you’re the ones who took me hostage (=ω=;)
  Duct Tape: 
  I mean… you willing went with us
  Alphabet Boy: 
  Because you lured me with merch
  Human Car: 
  I do not condone the kidnapping of Izuku
  Izuku’s Slave: 
  I know where they are~
  Alphabet Boy: 
  Unless you have more merch, you won’t say anything
  Izuku’s Slave: 
  I don’t know where they are
  Tired Slut: 
  I am honestly amazed by how much control Midoriya has over a villain.
  Izuku’s Slave: 
  Hey, he’s a scary guy
  SuperNova: 
  Our Deku? No way!
  Izuku’s Slave: 
  Okay, you’re just intentionally ignoring the facts.
  Tired Dad: 
  ARE YOU GUYS IN THE VENTS AGAIN!?
  Queen Mina: 
  Why would you think that? We are hanging out nowhere near the vents!
  Alphabet Boy: 
  Busted. I told you to stop laughing Denki
  Sparky: 
  In my defense, Mina's demands were pure gold.
  Explosions: 
  IM COMING FOR YOU GUYS
  Alphabet Boy: 
  im more worried about the fact thAT AIZAWA IS CHASING US! WHY MUST THIS KEEP HAPPENING TO ME!?
  Skeleton Dad: 
  Aizawa, please spare young Izuku. I have a meeting planned with him and his mother tonight.
  Icy Hot: 
  A meeting… or a family dinner?
  Alphabet Boy: 
  YOU DID NOT JUST IMPLY THAT MY MOTHER AND TOSHINORI ARE DATING
  SuperNova: 
  Oh, I think he did. And All Might doesn't care about the others, apparently. 
  Skeleton Dad: 
  (ΘεΘ;)
  Friday 3:33 PM
  Alphabet Boy: 
  I swear to god Hand Job you better get the fuck out of my room, and I know you're there so dont lie, before I Detroit smash your head into the wall!

  Who's in your room?
  Alphabet Boy: 
  Shigaraki. He wants Dabi back. I told him at the end of the month.
  Izuku's Slave: 
  Fair enough
  Alphabet Boy: 
  He almost got me, not gonna lie, but he accidentally grabbed the merch he had with all five fingers like a dumbass
  Izuku's Slave: 
  Ha! I bet he's throwing a tantrum in his room right now.
  Alphabet Boy:
   Probably lol. Maybe now he'll be more careful and not disintegrate the doorknob to the bathroom. I don't want to listen to another one of Toga's rants
  Izuku's Slave: 
  You and me both. She's like a little sister to me, but she's also super annoying sometimes. Especially when she starts monologuing about how much she loves you
  Alphabet Boy: 
  Don't remind me (￣(エ)￣)
  Incognito:
   You know you're still in our group chat, right?
  Alphabet Boy:
   Oops, got a little carried away
  SuperNova: 
  It's like seeing a whole other side of Deku
  Skeleton Dad: 
  Next time Shigaraki is in your room, just let me know. I'll protect you!
  Screaming Dad: 
  I mean, it seems like he doesn't need any protection from them
  Tired Son:
   Hey, Izu, can I come over? 
  Alphabet Boy: 
  Sure!
  SuperNova: 
  Hey, uh, speaking of Toga? I think she's following Tsu and I on our date? Can you talk to her Deku? 
  Alphabet Boy: 
  Just leave it to me! (॓_॔)
  Alphabet Boy: 
  Enjoy your date!
  Friday 4:00 PM
  Kermit the Frog: [Image]
    Attached is a picture of Midoriya tackling a surprised Toga
  SuperNova: 
  Thanks Deku!
  Alphabet Boy: 
  d(-_^)
  Izuku's Slave: 
  Hey, Toga's ranting to me about how she just wanted to join in cause she also likes Frog Girl and Space Cadet? 
  Kermit the Frog: 
  No.
  SuperNova: 
  Double no.
  Alphabet Boy: 
  Don't worry. I'm having a talk with her.
  Skeleton Dad: 
  Are you alright son?
  Alphabet Boy:
   I'm fine! It's not that hard to dodge her knives, luckily. Or maybe it's just getting easier for me.
  Tired Dad: 
  I'm just… so done.
  Tired Dad: 
  With all of you
  Tired Son: 
  Even me?
  Tired Dad: 
  No, not you 
  Screaming Dad: 
  What about me~?
  Tired Dad: 
  Especially you.
  Alphabet Boy: 
  Alright, I talked with Toga. She has agreed to go back to the LOVs base. For now.
  Izuku's Slave: 
  Did you have to bribe her with a lock of your hair like last time?
  Alphabet Boy:
   Nah. Just had to agree to give her some pears from my island in Animal Crossing: New Horizons. 
  Izuku's Slave: 
  YOU HAVE PEARS!? GIVE ME SOME!
  Alphabet Boy:
   Kk. Dm me your friend code.
  Izuku's Slave: 
  HAH! I'M GOING TO RUB THIS IN HAND JOB'S FACE!
  Skeleton Dad: 
  Wait… a lock of your hair…?
  Alphabet Boy: 
  Last time she was stalking me she told me she would leave if I gave her some of my hair. That, or some of my skin. I chose the hair.
  Tired Son: 
  You little shit you didn't tell me you have Animal Crossing. Give me your code.
  Alphabet Boy: 
  You didn't ask! Sending it now.
  Screaming Dad: 
  WE'RE GETTING PEARS ON OUR ISLAND!? YES!
  Tired Dad: 
  Why did I agree to marry you when all you do is blow out my ear drums?
  Screaming Dad: 
  Cause you love me~!
  Tired Son:
   Ew, that's so gay
  Tried Dad: 
  You're gay too you little shit.
  Queen Mina: 
  Wow. Flashback to when they were high. Speaking of that, though, Izuku can we get some weed?
  Alphabet Boy:
   Once I get back. I love you guys, but I can not trust you to not take it all.
  Sparky: 
  I mean… he has a point. 
  Friday 7:37 PM
  Alphabet Boy: 
  I have an emergency. 
  Tired Dad: 
  What is it now!?
  Alphabet Boy: 
  I kinda… well… Ochako and I were on the couch watching movies, and she fell asleep and accidentally smacked me, making me float, right? Well, the thing is, there was an open window and I flew out of it. Now I'm in the clouds and uh… I can't get down.
  Skeleton Dad: 
  WHAT? I'LL BE RIGHT THERE!
  Tired Dad: 
  ONE NORMAL DAY. PLEASE!
  Duct Tape: 
  I'll try and lasso you with my tape!
  Izuku's Slave: 
  Can't you just have blasty fly into the air like he did when you rescued him?
  Alphabet Boy: 
  Wait, I thought you were knocked out?
  Izuku's Slave: 
  Toga told me about it
  Alphabet Boy: 
  Ah. Oh! Sero, I see your tape!
  Duct Tape: 
  Good! Uraraka is making it float toward you.
  Alphabet Boy:
   I got it!
  Duct Tape: 
  Cool. Reeling you in now.
  Izuku's Slave:
   Izuku, I have to go.
  Alphabet Boy: 
  What? It's not the end of the month? Hand Job can wait.
  Izuku's Slave: 
  I'll DM you
  Saturday 10:28 AM
  Tired Son:
   Hey, Izuku told me to tell everyone he will be gone today and tomorrow. He won't be answering his phone either. Something about raising hell?
  Tired Dad: 
  What? Does it have something to do with why he let Dabi go?
  Tired Son: 
  I think? 
  Skeleton Dad:
   I am certainly… concerned. Izuku has been quiet ever since we got him down.
  SuperNova: 
  I wonder what Dabi said to him. Too bad he's not answering his phone…
  Icy Hot: @Izuku's Slave 
  what's going on?
  Izuku's Slave: 
  Oh, hey. Some bad stuff is going on right now and Izuku is helping us with it. He's not doing anything illegal. He's basically being… moral support, I guess.
  Icy Hot: 
  What kind of bad?
  Izuku's Slave: 
  Someone did something that they are going to regret. I can't give much information other than that. But yeah, I won't let Izuku do anything illegal. 
  Skeleton Dad: 
  So Izuku is safe?
  Izuku's Slave: 
  Yiu should be more worried about what he's planning to do to the guy that crossed us, honestly
  Tired Dad: 
  Just… make sure that he's taken care of, though I don't like the idea of him hanging out with the LoV.
  Tired Son: 
  This is Izuku we're talking about. He has the LoV wrapped around his finger, for the most part. He'll be fine
  Saturday 7:38 PM
  Alphabet Boy changed his name to Close to Murdering Someone
  Close to Murdering Someone:  
  So, I know I told Toshi that I wasn't going to text you guys but I just wanted to give everyone a quick update. I'm alright, physically at least, and I am super close to going and murdering the entire Yakuza
  Skeleton Dad: 
  Why?
  Close to Murdering Someone:
   Many, many reasons. 
  Close to Murdering Someone:
   Ok, no, scratch that.
  Close to Murdering Someone changed his name to Going to Murder Someone
  Going to Murder Someone: 
  Just got an update. I'm going to murder someone.
  Izuku's Slave: 
  I hate him too, but you can't murder him. You're going to be a hero, remember? 
  Going to Murder Someone:
   If it weren't for the laws of this land…
  Tired Dad:
   Wait, slow down. Who are you talking about? 
  Screaming Dad: 
  WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT MURDERING?
  Tired Slut:
   No murdering 
  Explosions:
   Who's murdering someone? 
  Going to Murder Someone: 
  I am going to murder someone. They’re being bad to a child. 
  Explosions: 
  Just remember to leave no evidence.
  Tired Dad: 
  … 
  Tired Dad: 
  Make sure to bring the child back here
  Skeleton Dad: 
  Aizawa! Izuku, who is this person? The pros can handle it.
  Going to Murder Someone: 
  Sorry, gotta go! You’re breaking up. Can’t see the last message that was sent, unfortunately
  Izuku’s Slave: 
  Don’t worry. I won’t let him kill anyone. No promises for me though
        Notes:
          Sorry if it got a little bit too serious. And not as cracky. But Eri will show up next chapter!
      Chapter 11: Izuku has a child now
        Notes:
          So, I think I'm going to try and update this fic every Friday from now on. My other fics will hopefully start to have regular updates as well! But yeah. Eri is here now and Izuku has adopted her. Also Izuku's secret has been revealed. Maybe.
            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
    Chapter Text
  Saturday 10:22 PM
 Incognito: So, apparently our sweet Izuku is going to murder someone. Incognito: I don’t know how to feel about this. Kermit the Frog: He is talking about someone who is being mean to a child though… Overwhelming Darkness: I can’t say that I disapprove…  Tail: It’s like one of those logical problems… Icy Hot: If Izu, a pure being, says that someone should die, then… Queen Mina: I did say a while ago that Izu is a god and that his word is law Boulder: On one hand, we’re training to be heroes. On the other, hurting a child is something that’s unforgivable Tired Son: I’m on Izu’s side SuperNova: I’m going to have to agree with Deku Human Car: It doesn’t matter either way! Izuku is not going to murder someone. If he does show up with an injured child, however, then we will do our best to take care of that child. Izuku’s Slave: Yeah, we’re close to getting the child right now. She is unregistered, so… you guys can happily take her. She’s pretty cute. Her name is Eri, I believe. Won’t be able to say much more cause I’m fighting some guys. Icy Hot: Oh. Tired Dad: We’re getting a little girl, apparently… I’ll have to talk to Nezu about this. Tired Slut: A cute little girl!? I’m going to spoil her rotten! 
  Sunday 9:12 AM
  Going to Murder Someone changed his name to Eri’s Protector
  Eri’s Protector: [Image]
   Attached is an image of Izuku holding a small girl with white hair and a horn. There were a few cuts on Izuku, but he was grinning happily while a building was on fire with blue flames in the background. The little girl was swallowed in an All Might hoodie that fit like a dress on her 
 Eri’s Protector: This is my child now SuperNova: She’s so cute! I’m assuming that’s Eri?  Punk Rock: Aww. Eri’s just swallowed in that hoodie Everything: I have so many clothing ideas planned for her! Explosions: You better take her to Recovery Girl before coming back to the dorms! Duct Tape: I feel like we’re all going to be really protective of her Tired Dad: …There is a fire in the background. Make sure she doesn’t get too hot or inhale any smoke Skeleton Dad: You didn’t do anything illegal, right? You aren’t going to be charged with kidnapping? Izuku’s Slave: Her “guardian” is no longer fit to care for her. Considering he doesn’t have any arms. He’s not going to report her missing if he knows what’s good for him. Screaming Dad: I don’t know how to feel about this. She is really cute though! Eri’s Protector: She’s a little shaken up, but doesn’t have any major injuries. I’ll take her to Recovery Girl and while she’s being checked out, I’m going to try and find loopholes for adopting her! And if I can’t, well… Aizawa? Tired Dad: Hizashi? Screaming Dad: I wouldn’t mind a daughter! Tired Dad: Hitoshi? Tired Son: I can be a good older brother Tired Dad: Alright then. We’ll take custody of her. Eri’s Protector: d(-_^) Eri’s Protector: um… hi. I’m Eri. Izu said you guys are really nice… i hope i can meet you guys soon SuperNova: So cute! Boulder: We can’t wait to meet you either!  Kermit the Frog: We’ll make sure you’re comfortable here 
  Sunday 4:57 PM
 Eri’s Protector: So, had to go to the police in the end, but once everything was explained… to an extent… Eri is now in the custody of UA, and more specifically Aizawa, thanks to her quirk. She can rewind living objects, which is such a cool quirk! She can’t really control it though so that’s why she will be with Aizawa. Tired Son: Which means she’s also my little sister now. So if anyone even thinks of messing with her, you’ll have to go through me. 
  Tired Son changed his name to Eri’s Big Bro
 Explosions: Oh shut it Eyebags! No one is going to mess with her. But if anyone did, they would have to deal with me first. Eri’s Protector: Oh Kacchan, Toshi, you two are so silly. If someone messed with Eri, you wouldn’t even be able to find them when I was done with them. (◡‿◡✿) Izuku’s Slave: Hypothetically, if Izuku was with us when we destroyed the Yakuza, hypothetically speaking he would have beat the shit out of Overhaul while using Eri’s quirk to balance his own so that he could absolutely destroy that motherfucker and make his face unrecognizable. Hypothetically.  Skeleton Dad: … if that hypothetically did happen, the I suppose I would hypothetically be both proud and disappointed, but mostly proud.Boulder: I would hypothetically complement Izuku and call him manly SuperNova: I would hypothetically high five Izuku. Human Car: I would hypothetically lecture Izuku, but be proud he rescued a little girl Explosions: I would hypothetically say the nerd did good for once Everything: I would hypothetically be in the same position as Iida. Tired Dad: I would hypothetically threaten to expel Midoriya Eri’s Protector: Well, good thing this is all purely hypothetical and there is absolutely no surviving evidence that I did anything like that! (⊙ω⊙✿) 
  Sunday 8:30 PM
 Eri’s Protector: Aizawa, Eri, and I are on our way to the dorms, finally. Sorry Tenya, but Eri won’t let go of me so you’re going to have to wait a little longer for your turn. Eri and I will be sleeping in the common area Everything: I’ll make sure you two have a comfy bed! With lots of soft pillows and stuffed animals! I am surprised that you were able to take Eri here the same day that you rescued her though Eri’s Protector: Aww, thank you! The only reason we were able to get her in our custody so fast is thanks to Toshinori pulling some strings. That and I know the Prime Minister.  Boulder: wait… what? Sparky: You just happen to know the Prime Minister!? Eri’s Protector: Yup. I called in a favor she owed me. Duct Tape: She owed you a favor!? Eri’s Protector: Yup. Queen Mina: What? You have to tell us everything. Like how you even met her! And why she owed you a favor! Explosions: Deku has connections. Don’t question them. Skeleton Dad: I was surprised as well. Izuku just told me not to question it, however, and I trust him. Eri’s Protector: Anyway, we could potentially have a sleepover in the common area. Eri said it might make her feel safer, but she wants to meet you all first. Human Car: I will do my best to make sure she is comfortable, and I'm sure the rest of the class will as well! Incognito: I’ll bring all my big stuffed animals down! Boulder: I’ll throw in my weighted blankets! Master of Sweets: I don’t know what she’s gone through, but sweets always make things better. I’ll make a wide variety of desserts so we can see what she likes the most. Do you know if she has any allergies? Eri’s Protector: She’s never really had sweets, so that sounds awesome. No allergies from what the doctors could tell Everything: That poor child… we’ll make sure she has a wonderful time here! Punk Rock: I’ll bring down a good variety of music too for her to listen to Eri’s Protector: @Eri’s Big Bro You getting in on this? Eri’s Big Bro: Of course Screaming Dad: Teachers will be there too to supervise! Incognito: AKA Present Mic wants to spend time with Eri too Tired Slut: I’ve already bought toys and clothes to spoil her with Skeleton Dad: I guess I’ll be there too?
  Izuku’s Slave to Deku
   Sunday 9:01 PM
 Izuku’s Slave: Hey, do I have to come back? Or am I good? Deku: Hm… Have Kurogiri drop off some more of the good stuff and some candy, then we’ll call it good. Izuku’s Slave: Sounds good to me 
  Class 1-A
  Sunday 9:07 PM
 Eri’s Protector: I have now secured some good candy as well. And some more of the good stuff, but weed is off limits with Eri around Queen Mina: SO YOU DO GET YOUR STUFF FROM SOMEWHERE! We were starting to think that you were growing it Eri’s Protector: Unless I’m trying to throw you off my trail ( ^▽^)σ)~O~) Queen Mina: Mmmmmmm Queen Mina: Why ya gotta do that to me Queen Mina: One of your girlfriends Eri’s Protector: And now Eri is asking about girlfriends and boyfriends. I have only just become a father and I now have to give the talk! Eri’s Big Bro: Hey, my little sister does not need the talk yet, or any boyfriends and or girlfriends and or datemates in general.  Tail: Wait, if Izuku is Eri’s new father, and Shinso is her big brother, then does that mean that Shinso is now Izuku’s son? And where do Aizawa and Present Mic play into this? Joint custody? Queen Mina: This is why we don’t overthink relationships in this chat! Screaming Dad: Now I’m thinking about it… ugh…  Skeleton Dad: I’m confused (´ー｀) Eri’s Protector: ANYWAY!  Eri’s Protector: We’ll see you guys in a bit! Eri’s Protector: Aizawa said to get as many cats into the area we’ll be sleeping as you guys can. Counting on you Koji!Tree: d(-_^)

  Well of course you did

  Mm whatcha say
  Duct Tape: 
  Mm that it’s all for the best
  Screaming Dad: 
  OF COURSE IT IS!
  Tired Dad: 
  PLease no.
  SuperNova: 
  Who got shot?
  Eri’s Protector: 
  Kacchan. Well, he got kicked in the balls. Kirishima was showing off his quirk and was punching and kicking air. HE didn’t know that Kacchan was behind him though and kicked behind him in a sort of spin attack, and got Kacchan right in the balls.
  SuperNova: 
  Oh no
  Sparky:

  Boulder: 
  I SAID I WAS SORRY! I DIDN’T KNOW YOU WERE THERE!
  Explosions: 
  I DON’T WANT TO HEAR YOUR EXCUSES!
  Eri’s Protector: 
  Eri is questioning me about anatomy now. Being a father is hard. I’m going to be a better father to her than my biological dad though! I will be the best father!
  Skeleton Dad: 
  I can’t believe I’m already a grandfather. It brings tears to my eyes (o´ω｀o)
  Monday 11:12 AM
  Human Car: 
  Izuku, where are you and Eri?
  Eri’s Big Bro: 
  They’re with me
  Tired Dad: 
  I swear if you three are in the vents…
  Eri’s Protector: 
  We’re not (≧ω≦) 
  Eri’s Big Bro: 
  We’re on the roof for some fresh air. We tried to go into the cafeteria, but it was a little overwhelming for Eri so we brought her to the roof.
  Tired Dad: 
  Alright. She has plenty of food, right?
  Eri’s Protector: 
  Yeah! I got up early and made her a big lunch this morning!
  Eri’s Big Bro: 
  He made one for me too
  Eri’s Big Bro: [Image]
    Attached is an image of three beautiful bentos. The purple one with cat paws all over it had a lot of cat-themed food, the pink one with flowers all over it had a lot of cute shapes and delicious looking food, and the All Might-themed one was a little plain, but the food still looked good.
  Queen Mina: 
  WHAT!? SHINSO GETS A HANDMADE BENTO FROM IZU!?
  Sparky: 
  NO FAIR!
  Duct Tape: 
  Um, I want some
  Punk Rock: 
  He has an All Might bento. It’s beautiful.
  Buff Dad: 
  I AM HERE!
  Skeleton Dad: 
  And I must say, it’s very nice of you guys to eat with Eri in a place where she is more comfortable.
  Sparky: 
  Wha…
  Boulder: 
  How did you do that?
  Queen Mina: 
  Is Zuzu to blame?
  Eri’s Protector: 
  Zuzu’s been on vacation since chapter 9 and hasn’t gotten back yet.
  Incognito: 
  Two- no, three questions: First, how did All Might change his name twice without it showing? Second, how is Zuzu on vacation if he can’t leave your phone? Third, chapter nine?
  Skeleton Dad: 
  I don’t know. I didn't try to change it.
  Eri’s Protector: 
  Zuzu went back to his world for a bit. He wanted to visit his family. And I told you that we’re all in a fanfic~!
  Incognito: 
  I…. okay
  Icy Hot: 
  Wait. Now I have to debate with myself whether or not I prefer cold soba, or a bento made by Izuku.
  Eri’s Protector: 
  How about once the sleep schedule circles back to Sho, I will make the bento of whoever I’m sleeping with?
  Queen Mina: 
  That sounds good!
  Screaming Dad: 
  By the way! We have been discussing living situations for Eri, since Sho, Midoriya, and I all live in the 1-A dorm. We have decided that Midoriya will be moved into the girls side of the second floor, since no girls are there, and Eri can have a room next to him!
  Eri’s Protector: 
  I am fine with that. I’ll let Eri know
  Eri’s Big Bro: 
  Eri is so happy to have her own room next to Izu that she tackled him in a hug. He promised to take her shopping with me tagging along so she could decorate it however she wants. 
  Incognito: 
  I can show you guys where I get the comfiest and softest stuffed animals!
  Eri’s Big Bro: 
  And now Izu is crying because Eri said she wants the room themed after her number one hero; him
  Screaming Dad: 
  AWWWWW! GET A PICTURE HITOSHI!
  Eri’s Big Bro: 
  Already did
  Eri’s Big Bro: [Image]
    Attached is an image of Izuku holding Eri close while crying a ridiculous amount of tears. Eri has the smallest of smiles on her face as she hugs Izuku back.
  SuperNova: 
  Awwwww!
  Queen Mina: 
  Totally saving that pic!
  Incognito: 
  It shall be my new home screen!
  Everything: 
  I will admit, this is one of the cutest photos I’ve ever seen
  Punk Rock: 
  So cute…
  Kermit the Frog: 
  Reminds me of my little siblings
  Icy Hot: 
  I’m going to print out copies for everyone
  Kaminari: 
  You rock dide!
  Punk Rock: 
  *Dude
  Master of Sweets: 
  Have you learned what her favorite sweet is yet?
  Eri’s Protector: 
  She said that she really wants to try a candied apple, since she thinks apples are her favorite fruit. 
  Master of Sweets: 
  She can expect one at the end of the day!
  Eri’s Bro: 
  This is Eri. Thank you Sato! 
  Master of Sweets: 
  Aww, no problem!

Tuesday 12:20 AM
Eri’s Protector: HYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKING…Tired Dad: What did you doEri’s Protector: HYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKINGTired Slut: Completely hypotheticalEri’s Big Bro: The most hypotheticalEri’s Protector: Hypothetically speaking, what would the proper response be to finding an unknown villain starring at you through the window????Tired Dad: GOD DAMNIT PROBLEM CHILD! IT’S ALWASU YOUEri’s Protector: Ah, don’t worry. Half of the class has just tackled them to the groundEri’s Protector: And it turns out that it was just Ayoama offering more cheese.Bolder: Sorry about that bro! SuperNova: I’m so sorry Ayoama! Glitter for All: It is alright, everyone. I understand that I could have been perceived as being a villain at that moment due to the bad lightingEri’s Protector: OH YEah that reminds me! I was thinking, if all heroes became villains, who would be the most dangerous?Eri’s Big Bro: Dad, since he can erase Quirks. Or Pops, since he can make everyone deafBoulder: I mean, Midnight could just knock everyone out though… so maybe her?SuperNova: What about Endeavwhore? Icy Hot: I don’t think he counts, since he already is like a villainSuperNova: Good pointExplosions: BEST JEANIST, DUH. HE CAN CONTROL CLOTHES, AND EVERYONE WEARS CLOTHES. NOW GO TO BED!Sparky: Come on guys, I’m like, the dumbest in class but I still know who the most dangerous one would be. Queen Mina: Who?Sparky: Nezu, duhPunk Rock: Wow, Kaminari actually is right about something…Eri’s Protector: Kaminari, I’ve been thinking about you. Sparky: Should I be concerned???Eri's Protector: You know so much about electricity that it isn’t even funny. All the symbols, the equations, even the way you position your hands when you use your Quirk takes into account the rules of electromagnetism. Yet, despite all that, you claim you're dumb.Sparky: Well, uh… I guess it's just easier for me to learn about electricity related things cause it interests me??? Maybe???Eri's Protector: Hm….. I'm going to try something later… at a later date
  Tuesday 6:24 AM
Human Car: Good morning everyone! I hope everyone remembered to get a proper amount of sleep for the test we have today!Queen Mina: I forgot about the test…Boulder: Shoot….Grape Rush: It'll be easy peasy
  Eri's Protector changed their name to Broccoli Bitch
  Broccoli Bitch: Grew up in the French Court 
SuperNova: Huh?
  Skeleton Dad: Oui oui bonjour
Glitter for All: You're French as well~?Explosions: No you didn't???
  Broccoli Bitch: Life was a chore
  Skeleton Dad: (So he set sail)
Tired Dad: What's going on?
  Broccoli Bitch: 1522 came straight from the UK. All the British dudes, lame
  Skeleton Dad: Epic fail!
Human Car: What are they talking about? Explosions: You've never even left Japan!
  Broccoli Bitch: Ooh, I want to dance and sing
Queen Mina: I'll dance with you!Punk Rock: YES
  Punk Rock: Politics?
  Broccoli Bitch: Not my thing! 
  Skeleton Dad: Ooh~!
Tired Slut: Please tell me I'm not the only one who is confused? Everything: I am too
  Broccoli Bitch: But then I met the King!
Kermit the Frog: Are you talking about how you know the Prime Minister? 
  Screaming Dad: And soon your daddy said;
Tired Dad: Not you too…
  Skeleton Dad: You should try to get ahead!

  Broccoli Bitch: Messaging me like every day
Human Car: Who are you talking about? Who is the king?Queen Mina: My money is on either Katsuki or TodorokiIcy Hot: I mean, I do message Izuku everyday
  Broccoli Bitch: Couldn't be better, then he sent me a letter and who am I kidding?

There's no way that this is true!Sparky: I think Jiro, All Might, and Present Mic know what's going on though???

        Notes:
          I'm in the middle of a reboot, sorry. Depression and mental breakdowns suck. Plus working 6 days a week at a factory doesn't help. I'm getting better though! Updating fanfics is now back on the table, and hopefully, soon I'll get a schedule set up. Well, either way, I hope you've enjoyed this! And if you don't know the song... I'm sorry lolAlso! The who would be the most terrifying villain thing was an idea suggested by Marsjan~!

        "Shoto Todoroki changed his name to Zuko and Elsa's Love Child"No, he's Zuko and Weiss Schnee's Love Child. Get it right (Mainly a joke, don't worry). Still, Izuku is a chaos gremlin, and I love it.

        I haven't really watched more than a few episodes of RWBY, so I didn't really think of her lol. And Izuku going to be a chaos gremlin for most of the fic lol

        You know it’s 2 am, I’m in a dark room by myself, I just read fanfiction characters realizing they’re fanfiction characters via a chat fic then a character’s phone was possessed by a demon. I love this so much! I live for fictional chaos!

        I have a habit of redeeming Mineta in my fics instead of just getting rid of him, like how a lot of people deal with him.

        Holy MADRES NUECES. Do you know a youtuber who's name is dross he's Argentino and one time he talk about a demon named zozo (kind of silly name like for a teddy bear but ñeh) so when i read zuzu was like "holy nancites she know who is dross" but i really like your chat fic. ❤

        Unfortunately, I do not know who that is. I got Zuzu from Izuku's name. I'm glad you like my fic though, and I'll go check out Dross!

        Did not expect a random Gavin screaming reference in here.I always love crack fics that stretch personalities juuust enough to still feel like the characters but not have to be bound to bring 100% authentic. Like I could easily see these being their personalities in an abridged version or something

        I mean... there are some other bakusquad poly fics. I definitely am planning on including more of it in my future fanfics though.
