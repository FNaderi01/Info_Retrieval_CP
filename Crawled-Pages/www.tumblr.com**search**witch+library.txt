This is by far my favourite thing I’ve seen for this community. I feel so much pressure to read certain books that I haven’t got the money to buy and I feel wrong talking about the ones I am reading. This community is great, and I know we all want to be pretentious and snobby, but let’s use that for aesthetic purposes and not to put others down. (Btw ironically enough I found this text post on Instagram, not Tumblr and now I’m reposting it to Tumblr because idk how to find the original) The original creators: @read-and-be-merry @iammewhooaryou @narukoibito

Often in my busy schedule I forget to take time for myself to quiet my mind and read a book. 📚I used to be such an avid reader but as of late it seems like the distractions too often get in the way. What are your strategies for making time in your schedule to slow down and focus on what really brings you joy? 🌼
