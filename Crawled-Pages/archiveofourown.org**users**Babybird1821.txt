    Summary
      Our girl was found in the woods as a toddler, naked and alone, and completely unafraid of the pack of wolves that gathered to surround her.  In a dry, brown area, she sat atop a patch of lush greenery and flowers, next to a strangely pristine crystal-clear pond, right in the path of the elk the pack had been hunting.Some twenty-four years later, thanks to pride, shitty apartments, and ham-handed flirting on the part of a young male werewolf, she finds herself in Shreveport's (in)famous vampire bar, Fangtasia, carefully avoiding as much attention as possible and doing everything she can to stay clear of the large blond man on the dais.- August 2020: fic still not abandoned, all appearances to the contrary *cough*
