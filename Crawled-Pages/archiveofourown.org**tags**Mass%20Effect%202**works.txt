    Summary
      NOVEL!! Many chapters incoming. :)This saga takes place about 15 years after the Ryder saga. New heroes, new enemies are coming. The quarian ark has made it to Andromeda an brought hanar, drell, volus and quarians with into the galaxy. Furthermore there is a slight merge between Mass Effect and Shadowrun. You will recoginze familiar shadowrun classes and terms.I hope you‘re gonna like it. The story is about Samuel Wolfsbane, an elven ki-adept, commander of the "Phoenix", with a great destiny, his sister, Samara Wolfsbane, aspiring emissary of humans and his very colorful an very crazy crew. And the space dachshund Tiberius. This novel contents homosexual love! Also violence, battles, drama, action, sex with mature content, many adventures, martial arts and comedy. I‘m not a native speaker so my English isn‘t that excellent. Now enjoy! :)

    Summary
      With rumours rampant lately over a Mass Effect Trilogy Remaster being in the works, with an emphasis on being ‘more adult’ when it comes to the nude/sex scenes my imagination conjured a whirlwind of possibilities. So I’m here to fill in the sexual gaps yet again. As before I've scripted them to continue on from the main romance scenes within the games and are presented as if you are playing the game yourself. Each scene is only short so its a quick read and I will be adding more over the coming weeks. Also check out Filling in the Sexual Gaps: Andromeda.

    Summary
      When the Long Night of Solace is evaporated over Reach via the weaponized usage of a Slipspace Drive, it ferries with it in its swallowed sections the Covenant Empire and, more horrifyingly, the desperate measures that the UNSC used to fight them. When they are found in a universe on the precipice of their own history, the meaning of the term "Mass Effect" will change forever.
