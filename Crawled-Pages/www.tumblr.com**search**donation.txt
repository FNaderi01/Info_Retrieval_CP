2I need to get out of hereI have never made any type of post like this and it‚Äôs going to be long and annoying but I just can‚Äôt fucking take this anymore. I‚Äôm Sophie, I am a 19 year old latina girl who has been living with an abusive man double my age for the last couple of years after running away. I feel trapped here and I have no means to leave safely at all. I‚Äôm mentally ill and on disability which doesn‚Äôt leave me with any room to get away from him and he is extremely controlling even when it comes to money and what I should have to owe him for living with him. I have no family to lean on and the friends I did have, he has cut me off completely from them. He‚Äôs smashed my phone when he got paranoid leaving me with nothing and no one. He monitored my phone and my social media so I have had to make separate accounts to try and hide him from seeing what I post. Not only that but he is racist, he hates women, believes in white supremacy, thinks that all girls should only be with men and give themselves to men whether they want to or not.. it just goes on and on and never stops. He always talks about genocide, thinks women ask for too much, ect. He has actually gone to jail in the past for assault. He threatens me with violence if I don‚Äôt do the things he asks for all the time and my mental health has gone downhill since I came here. There are so many things that have happened that I can‚Äôt even talk about.I am always being taken advantage of, threatened, manipulated into sex, into giving him money, just so that I won‚Äôt be out on the streets with no where to go. This type of life is making me want to kill myself if I can‚Äôt get a change soon but I am terrified of the thought of leaving him. I want to get a restraining order so that he can‚Äôt come after me, but if I do that I will have no place to live because I can‚Äôt afford the apartment I live in if he‚Äôs not here. I need help getting out. There is no way I can afford to pay a deposit, pet fee, and first months rent on a cheaper apartment with the income and type of life I have right now. He knows about how much money I bring in a month, and with my bills and everything I have very little. I know what I need is a lot, my goal is around $500 dollars even though that won‚Äôt begin to cover it, I don‚Äôt expect much help at all. Even a couple dollars I have that I can hide from him will hopefully add up.I was at risk of being homeless when I met him because of leaving my family. I thought that because he had issues too that he was a good person at heart but I can‚Äôt take the way that he treats me anymore, it has only gotten worse. If you don‚Äôt believe me, or think I shouldn‚Äôt be asking for this kind of help or think this is all my fault just block me. I have had too many people act like I am over exaggerating or that I‚Äôm crazy. I will just block you. my paypal email is sophimazziotti@gmail.com if you can help at all and if you cant i understand I know everyone is struggling and other people need more help than I do but I would be so thankful if you would please please reblog this post for me. Thank you.

My donation posts keep losing traction, so I repost a new one every few weeks‚Ä¶ My family is still quarantining, none of us could afford treatment if we got sick, and we have an ongoing need for donations. My housemates and I are all disabled trans people, but nobody is opposed to doing safe work we can fit in. Nobody wants to leave the house to catch my their death, I have severe asthma, and I deal with chronic pain that makes it hard to walk and stand for long periods big time. I deal with debilitating mental illness (bipolar and ptsd are most disruptive but im also autistic) I‚Äôm way too poor to treat any of my serious conditions right now. I need ongoing support for living expenses while I try to find work I can feasibly do from home.Everyone has an income of some sort, but it‚Äôs just a small trickle and rent/bills were set up in pre-Coronavirus conditions when everyone was working. We‚Äôre trying to ride out this lease and then move in February. I‚Äôm grinding non-stop on a LOT of different projects right now so I can bring in more income. Twitch streaming, video essays and commentary on youtube, essays on fashion, culture and politics, my own original story. I‚Äôve put in some applications for online work (that isn‚Äôt a scam, there‚Äôs a lot of those) and even jobs outside the house but the pandemic is still a problem. If I find a resource that helps us, I apply.Literally anything helps, a 2$ donation got me out of overdraft earlier this week. Donations go to food, HRT, rent, bills, moving costs because I‚Äôm in the process of relocating. I also add money to my imprisoned dad‚Äôs commissary regularly.PayPal - strangenoun@gmail.comVenmo/Cashapp - $vynsla

Absolutely TIRED of being stuck in this situation.  This year has been hell with losing everything I worked so hard on last year, having to move in with my abusive uncle and now this virus has made it even worse.  I‚Äôve lost so much weight thanks to not being able to afford food.  My mental health has completely shit the bucket. I‚Äôm tired of dealing with my uncles abuse, and the. this morning he locked us out of the house‚Ä¶AGAIN and we‚Äôre stuck in the car with nothing and unless he decides to change his mind, we‚Äôre stuck.  I‚Äôm over it..I wish I had anyone to help, but I have no one.  I really just want to disappear.  I feel like the absolute worst cat mom having to put Eira through this.  ***Update: June 5,2020***I found a safe place to go but have to get enough to get us and our stuff 2 hours away in a car and truck, so if anyone can just help with that I will finally be in a safe place!I‚Äôm sure no one will help, but please if you can even if it‚Äôs just to get some food.  I just don‚Äôt know what the fuck to do right now.  Message me if you have any questions üíïCashapp: $brianapietropaulaVenmo: @brianajeannepPayPal: if you have PayPal send me a message! I have one I can use but don‚Äôt want to post is publicly

hey, hi, what‚Äôs poppinmy name is miles and i‚Äôm a 17 y/o blasian lesbian and i could genuinely use some helpjust to run you through some stuff real quick-my mom has had ongoing health issues but makes ‚Äútoo much‚Äù to qualify for medicaid (almost all of her checks go to rent and groceries, we live okay but she still needs medical help that we can‚Äôt afford)-my mom‚Äôs car desperately needs repairs. every time we drive the car wobbles really bad and while this can be ignored for now, there‚Äôs definitely a chance this car could quit on us if we aren‚Äôt careful-i need braces and college tuition money and pants and shoes because everything is getting old or never fit in the first place and while i do have a job i‚Äôve worked maybe 1-2 days a week (and that‚Äôs essentially pennies since i‚Äôm paying partially for gas and saving for college)-on top of all of that we would have much more support if my mom wasn‚Äôt listed as ‚Äútechnically‚Äù married despite the fact that we have been surviving with minimal help from my stepfather, especially in regards to me (and divorces are exPENSIVE)tldr: i say all that to say I kinda just need help, none of this is immediately urgent but it would be great that if you could spare anything to throw like‚Ä¶. 3 cent my wayi also do commisions if you don‚Äôt like the idea of donating to some random person and I can do stuff like this! so yeah! If you‚Äôre feeling generous I‚Äôd do icons and stuff for like $5-$10 depending on the complexitypaypal.me/milesahm (my birthname is on that account, which is why i‚Äôm not directly linking it. sorry.)

Please help me üôèüèªIm seriously having the worst luck..after my abusive uncle kicked my bf, my cat and I out onto the street and ruined our plans of a safe place to go to we have now gotten into a car accident, my uncle sent my bfs unemployment cards back to the sender just to be spiteful so now we have to figure out where we can get mail sent to.  He‚Äôs currently threatening to throw all my belongings out onto the street if I don‚Äôt get them out by Monday and our car is barely drivable so I have to find someone who can help quickly.  Everything is an absolute mess and the only good thing so far is that someone got us an Airbnb but it‚Äôs only until July 17 and my cat is safe atleast.  It‚Äôs just been really stressful, my mental and physical health are at an all time low.  My head has been pounding since the car accident, I‚Äôm heart broken having to be away from my cat, I‚Äôm super upset that our car, the only thing we had is now destroyed and the roof over our head is going to be gone in the blink of an eye.  We‚Äôre having trouble even keeping ourselves fed(which is hard as is since I‚Äôve been having health issues where everything I eat causes me a ton of pain, nausea, sulfur burps etc) and with the virus making a come back jobs are scarce and risking getting it is scary when I have asthma.  I really don‚Äôt know what to do. We don‚Äôt have an address to apply for assistance, unemployment has been taking forever and now we gotta work stuff out with getting my bfs card because of my uncle.  I really need some help to keep the Airbnb for a bit longer so we can sort stuff out(I‚Äôm really scared to end back up on the street especially with our car in the shape it is), make our car atleast semi drivable, get food in the fridge because I‚Äôm losing a lot of weight quick and my ED is incredibly triggered.  I‚Äôm just really scared and have nowhere to turn.  Please if anyone can help it would be greatly appreciated and once I get unemployment I will pay it forward to others in need üíú. You‚Äôre all beautiful people and I‚Äôve met such kind souls on here during the lowest point of my life.

Hey y'all! Vyn here, pulling together a donation post for my little family. I‚Äôve been staying with three other trans people during the quarantine: Aj, Artyom and Vee. We‚Äôve been pooling resources, covering each other when we need help, sharing meals, contributing to each other‚Äôs housing and medical costs and staying together even though some of us have our own homes to ward off despair in these trying times. I love them all so much. None of us can work right now, and nobody has received their tax refund or unemployment benefits. My wife has been sending me money to help keep us afloat, but she will be furloughed for the entire month of June and can no longer contribute. We all need to eat, afford important things like HRT, other medications, pet care, and also pay rent and bills.[Image description: Four people stand together in front of a forest. Vee is a black non-binary person, making a peace sign. AJ is a white trans woman, standing with her hands on Vee and Vyn‚Äôs shoulders. Vyn is a black trans man, posing with one hand on his hip. Artyom is a white non-binary person, standing with both their hands in their pockets.]I‚Äôll be taking donations for the household. If you have any resources/charities that will help, especially geared toward  QTPOC, trans people, and disabled people, please send them to me.Thanks for reading! Please share this post even if you can‚Äôt donate.My PayPal email is Strangenoun@gmail.comMy Cashapp and Venmo are both $Vynsla Edit: Added image description.
