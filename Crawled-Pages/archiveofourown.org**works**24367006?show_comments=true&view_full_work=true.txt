      Chapter 1
    Chapter Text
    It was late, too late. So late that Katsuki found himself racing home, running as fast as he could, his legs throbbed, he was out of breath but kept running, he couldn't afford to stop and be even later than he already is. It was almost 2 in the damn morning! He didn't keep track of the time! Kirishima is going to be so pissed! He thought about his kitty cat boyfriend, scratch that, his pregnant kitty cat boyfriend. He was already 9 months along. Their baby was due in a few days, Katsuki has seen movies, done research, sometimes the baby comes out early! What if Kirishima is alone at home and the baby decides to come out!? The thought of Kirishima being alone, in pain, needing him, made him run faster, He's almost there, he can make it. why did his patrol take so long?As he ran he thought about his schedule, how did it extend so long? He left the house at 8:30 that morning, why is he getting home at...he checked his phone...1:57?! In the morning! AM not PM. His baby strawberry Eijirou surely is worried (Yes, GemaBearMonsta, I used your nickname XD) He made it to the apartment, he threw the foyer door open and dashed to the elevator, he bumped into a sign, he groaned and looked down at it. A note from the landlord of the apartment.Dear Tenants,The elevator is currently out of order until further notice, At this point, we are not sure when the elevator will be open for use. we ask all tenants to stay patient while we try to locate the issue. All tenants are asked to take the stairs for the time beingThanks for understandingMahou KasanovaKatsuki groaned in disappointment and dashed up the stairs, just his damn luck. He lives on level 24, the highest level. He was already out of breath, let's add more to it! His palms sparked as he used his quirk to get up the stairs quicker. After 5 minutes, he made it halfway, the 12th stage. He had to rest, his body filled with exhaustion, no, he had to keep going. Eijirou might be worried, scared, in labour even! That thought made his panic as he kept running, gasping as he jumped up every step. Another 5 minutes flew by 'The baby would be born by now..' That is if his baby strawberry was in labour which he wished wasn't the case. He made it to the top floor, he ran down the hallway.Almost there...He made it to the front door, he fumbled with his keys in a frantic hurry. He shoved the key into the door keyhole, slamming the door open. He searched every room until he made it to the bedroom, he scanned the room and looked at the bed. There sat Kirishima. Hand on his stomach, smiling softly. He sang a soft tune, rocking back and forth softly."Seas invite in the evening sun""To light the somber abyss..""Clouds dance up with the heaven stars""Chanting an air of joyous bliss"Katsuki stood at the door, panting. He watched as his boyfriend sang to their unborn child, singing with the voice of an angel. Katsuki let out a small yet choked sob. The scene brought him to tears. He wasn't pregnant so why was Katsuki the emotional one? His hands gripped the doorframe. "Water fades back from blue to jade""Guiding young rainbows high""Flowers bloom into reds and whites" "Quenching our hearts as they run dry"Kirishima didn't notice his boyfriend standing there, he continued singing a soft lullaby to his unborn baby. Making sure his baby could hear. "Angels chained...by a beast locked in slumber..""Sin washed away, by the swift flow of time""I may know the answers..""Though one question I still hear""What twist in fate has brought us""That roads run so near"Katsuki approached, sitting down on the bed, tears rolling down his face. He held Kirishima's hand, making Kirishima jump. His singing stopped abruptly. He looked over at Katsuki and smiled -"What took you so long to get home Kats"- He whispered, smiling under the night lights, "The baby and I were getting worried." He joked, Katsuki placed his head on Kirishima's belly, listening softly to the babies kicks. "My bad...daddy's sorry he didn't get home earlier." He whispered to their baby boy. He waited for a kick before getting back onto the bed. "My bad my baby strawberry Eijirou" He wrapped his arms around Eijirou, letting tears roll down his pale cheeks. Kirishima held onto his human lover, tail wrapping around his arm. "I'm just happy your home now.." He whispered in his ear, running his fingers through Katsuki's spikey hair. "Could you continue the song?" Katsuki whispered back, "It's rare that I hear you sing, I wanna hear it again. It was pretty" He asked, warm hands rubbing Kirishima's belly softly, feeling the small kicks of their unborn son.Kirishima nodded "Of course" He cleared his throat before continuing the rest of the song, singing it as softly as before."Distant worlds together""Miracles from realms beyond""The life light burns inside me""To sing to you this song""To sing with you this song""To sing to you your song"Kirishima finished, holding Bakugou close. He looked down at him. Bakugou was fast asleep, so the lullaby did work. Kirishima kissed his head and drifted off to sleep. Holding his lover close he repeated the song in a hushed whisper. He slowly fell asleep, Bakugou was home, everything was okay nowSoon their baby would be born and a new chapter of their lives would begin, Kirishima was scared for the next step, was he even ready? was Katsuki ready? He hugged Katsuki tighter in his sleep, would they be okay? would the baby be healthy? The doctor did tell him the baby might have some complications but did the doctor tell them what complications? No he didn't. That fact alone was scary. But Kirishima had Katsuki. They've been through some scary stuff before. They would be just fine...

          Summary:
            The baby is here...
        Notes:
          Thanks GemaBearMonsta for helping me make a new chapter XD
    Chapter Text
    ((I promised myself I wasn't going to create the following chapter, but here I am, with an extra chapter.))Bakugou was at his agency when he got the call. He scrolled and browsed through countless papers and files, currently investigating a recent homicide. The endeavour was violent and dark, to say the least. A poor young girl was found dead in a river. She had to have been at least nine years old. Bakugou shuddered at the image that was so gratefully placed in his damn head.He felt the desk start to vibrate, followed by a familiar ringtone. He grabbed his phone from off the table and checked the ID, Kirishima's face was in the ID profile. Bakugou smiled and answered, he wasn't prepared for what was next."Hey, doll~ How's my balloon doin'~" Bakugou purred into the phone. He smirked thinking about Kirishima sitting there completely flustered by his words, instead of 'Katsuki! You're at work! People could hear! Shut your face!' being squeaked out, he heard something different "K-Kats, I don't have t-time for your flirts..." Kirishima choked out, It sounded like he was in pain, bad pain. Bakugou's face laced with concern "What? Are you okay baby strawberry?" He said quickly"N-not exactly...My water broke..."Oh fuck...That was right, Kirishima was due today. Kirishima had assured him everything would be fine, that Katsuki should go to work. Bakugou panicked "Shit, hold on. I'm coming home now if worse comes to worst and I'm a little late, just start. I'll be there in 10 minutes" He hung up and raced to his car, not bothering to answer the questions that his workers asked. He opened the door to his Jeep and hopped in, slamming his foot on the gas and speeding home, sure he was way over the speed limit, but his first-ever baby was coming! He had to be there! Bakugou parked and didn't care to go inside, he blasted himself up onto the balcony of their apartment and got in. He scanned around the heard crying from their bedroom. Bakugou cursed under his breath and ran as fast as he could to the room. He threw the door open and went in.His eyes widened. Kirishima sat on the floor, there was blood around him but in his arms, was a small baby boy, he had some black hair on the top of his head and Eijirou's teeth, he had bakugou's rosy cheeks and small nubs that bakugou knew were cat ears. He had missed it, but he can see his baby boy. fatherly instincts kicked in as he ran over to Eijirou and the baby. Falling onto his knees, gracefully like some kind of gay swan next to Kirishima. Tears brimmed his eyes as he got a better look at his baby boy.He kissed Eijirou's face, making sure every part of his face kissed it "I'm so sorry I missed it baby" He said to him. Kirishima shook his head "That's fine, at least our baby is here" They both took the time to gaze at their newborn son. "Did you decide on a name?" Bakugou asked he remembered how excited Kirishima was to name the baby. Kirishima nods "Yep! His name shall be Asashi" He said and giggled. Bakugou smiled "it's perfect, just like you," He said.Bakugou was happy. He had a son, a real baby! He was so ready for this. Kirishima did great, he always does.Who knew a song, made them closer than ever...

        AAAAHHHHH!!!! THIS WAS SUCH A NICE SUPRISE!!! I READ IT ON MY BREAK AT WORK!!!OMFG KIRISHIMA AS A NEKO!!! Stars are in my eyes that's the cutest shit ever. And he's nine months along close to popping! That would definitely drive the maniac bakugou katsuki up the wall knowing he can't be next to him bc he's working 😂😂👌🏾I love how he was internally freaking out on the inside worrying about Kirishima the whole time and Kirishima is just chill like his boyfriend is CRAZY Lol 😂😂💯And I just love the idea how Kirishima is like singing to their kid. I never thought about how he would be able to sing but I think he would be able to! Especially to their kid while he's alone. I loved how he sung to Bakugou at the end, too!!! That was perfect! Bakugou feeling the baby kick made my heart melt. He is so into Kirishima being pregnant that like it makes him so fatherly like he would be such a good parent. And the baby having complications 😭😭😩 omg that got me worried bc these two go through a lot but they can definitely make it together with the power of love!!! Ugh I love your writing, too! It's easy to read and just flows nicely. All in all this was such a cool read! Definitely has given me more ideas for my story pfft 🤣🤣 it got me thinking! Thanks so much for this seriously it made my day ❤️💯P. S. I GOTTA LISTEN TO THAT FINAL FANTASY SONG BRB LOL

        BRUH WHY DIDNT I KNOW THIS WAS UP!! 😭😭😭 WHY HAVENT I KUDOS THIS EITHER I THOUGHT I DID OMFG!!! AHHH SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT OMGG!! WHERE TO BEGIN!!!I love how Bakugou would be at work like when the baby decided to come and receive a call from Kirishima. Like when Bakugou was like "Hey, doll~! How's my balloon doing..." and Kirishima was in no mood to have his flirting going on! Haha I laughed really hard lol that part was cute but omfg Bakugou racing in his jeep to his penthouse to the apartment and blasting his ways up the stairs to get to his baby and Kirishima as soon as possible was just gold!I feel bad that Kirishima had to have his baby by himself at home 😭😭 that must've been so hard omfg but the baby came!!! Yay!!!And Asahi!!! I love how the baby takes after Kirishima like that's cute as hell he gonna be just like his momma! 😭🙏🏾💯💯 I'm glad the baby is finally here omfg this made me smile ear to ear!!!AND THE SONG DISTANT WORLDS!!! Bruh I've been listening to this song on repeat for the past week. Like it's so fucking good and its the perfect song for this couple. Like all I could imagine was Kirishima singing this song to Bakugou and his Asahi as a lullaby like omfg this song is fucking perfect👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾😭😭I loved this fic so much man!!! Like it was the cutest thing ever and a breath of fresh air!! Definitely made my day. It was so good!!!❤️❤️❤️
