    Summary
      Robin is the Boy Wonder, Batman's protegee, member of the "Junior Justice League" and kickass superhero. Dick Grayson is the adopted son of billionaire Bruce Wayne, brother to four younger siblings, math whiz-kid, community service volunteer and all-around Golden Child. It's everything he ever wanted to be. Too bad he's also a liar, a thief and a secret mercenary-in-training.

    Summary
      See, it happens like this. Everything’s normal for them all—or, well. As normal as a family full of vigilantes can get. But things are running smoothly. He keeps his head up and his ears open, though, because he may be able to move forward, but he isn’t stupid enough to think that he’s not going to hit a bump in the road. He always hits a bump in the road. He just hadn’t expected this.

    Summary
      It's actually an annual thing. Garth named it that on the first year of the Titans because it happens with a terrifying kind of regularity, some time around late spring early summer. It’s really around that time that Dick gets sick of playing good kid and remembers that he’s a kid who regularly rode elephants and jumped off high places for fun for the first nine years of his life.Dick always goes a bit crazy. Or a lot crazy. Or reminds the world that he’s always been crazy. The Titans even before they became the Titans, being the amazing friends they are, enabled the hell out of him.This year is completely Donna's fault and Roy is definitely going to kill her for it.Dick and Red Bull, honestly?
