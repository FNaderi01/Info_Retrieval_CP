       About this capture
    COLLECTED BY
		Organization: Archive Team
	   Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
The main site for Archive Team is at archiveteam.org and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the Wayback Machine, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
The Archive Team Panic Downloads are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures. 
		Collection: ArchiveBot: The Archive Team Crowdsourced Crawler
	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at http://www.archivebot.com.
ArchiveBot's source code can be found at https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot.

Islamist militants today attacked the US consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with explosives and machine guns, killing four security guards and five staff, Saudi officials said.
Gunmen fought their way into the complex, reportedly taking 18 staff and visa applicants hostage for a short time before Saudi security forces stormed the building, killing three attackers and arresting two others.
Witnesses reported hearing two explosions, which breached the heavily-guarded compound's walls as the attack began shortly before midday local time (0900 GMT).
The blasts caused fire to break out, and clouds of thick black smoke could be seen above the consulate. Around 200 national guardsmen surrounded the building, and witnesses reported heavy exchanges of gunfire. 
"We have five confirmed dead among our locally engaged staff and one of them is a contract [security] guard," the US embassy spokeswoman Carol Kalin said. 
She said no Americans had been killed and a "handful of other employees" had been taken to hospital. Security sources told Reuters the dead were Arabs and Asians. 
In a statement on Saudi television, an interior ministry official said three gunmen had been killed and two arrested after being wounded. Officials also said four members of the Saudi forces had been killed. The spokesman said the attackers had entered the compound after lobbing explosives at the gate. 
Earlier, the al-Arabiya satellite television reported that attackers had attempted to storm the compound in a car, and the vehicle exploded in front of the building. One witness reported billowing smoke, and said police officers were keeping traffic away from the area. Some witnesses said gunfire had been heard just before the blast. 
There was no early claim of responsibility. However, officials have blamed al-Qaida for a string of attacks in the kingdom over the past two years. 
Roger Harrison, of Arab News, said US citizens in Saudi Arabia saw themselves as the "number one target" for attackers. The US embassy in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, and the consulate in Dhahran were closed to the public as a precaution, officials said.
Khaled al-Maeena, the editor of the Jeddah-based Arab News, said helicopters were flying over the scene of today's attack. "The magnitude of this assault on the consulate has taken all Jeddah residents by surprise," he said. 
The consulate building is in the heart of the city, only half a mile from the Red Sea coastal road. Security around it has been very tight since last year's series of bombings of buildings housing foreign workers.
In May, 22 people, including six westerners, were killed by militants who sprayed gunfire inside an oil contractor's office in Yanbu, 220 miles (350 kilometres) north of Jeddah. 
Last November, a suicide car bomb killed 17 people and wounded 122 at a compound for foreign workers in Riyadh. Al-Qaida claimed responsibility for shooting dead a British national in Riyadh in September.
