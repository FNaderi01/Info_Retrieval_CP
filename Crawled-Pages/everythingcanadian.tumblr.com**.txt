You are the only one who gets to decide how you deal with this. Nobody gets to tell you you’re wrong for coping in your own way.If you want to yell, cry, whatever, and you want a safe space to do it, my messages are open. No judgement. No questions asked. I’ll check in on you.We have a responsibility to take care of ourselves and each other right now.Be kind.I love you.This.As long as your not hurting yourself, others, participating in illegal actions, or harassing the people around him then you can grieve however you need to. It doesn’t make you any less of a person.Whatever you need to do to heal is what you should do. Don’t let others tell you how to grieve.

                                thugheadjones:“If you are anything like me, all you’re doing is feeling like you, like you’re wishing that you’ll wake up at some point soon. That you’ll wake up and it was all a bad dream and it’s over. But that’s not going to happen. And you know, eventually that shock is going to wear off. It will. And then you’ll kind of have that acceptance…and then that’s when we can start to heal and move on.(…)One of the hardest things about this (…) there are a lot of things that people don’t know and people will never know. And that’s one of the things that is important to accept. There is a level of privacy and a level of professionalism (…) there will always be stuff that you don’t know. And that sucks, I know it sucks (…) but it’s just the way that that has to be, so you are just going to have to trust the people in AH, the people who like feel like we’ve lost a family member (…) what I’m asking is, you’re going to see a lot of people in AH saying things like they’re really hurt and feel like they’ve lost a family member. I think it’s important to remember we have our reasons for feeling this way. And there’s going to be a lot of people who try to argue with that…people who go ‘oh well how bad was it really? Was this really necessary?’ I’m just letting you know, every single decision that’s been made was necessary. None of this has been easy. I’m just asking you in this time to trust us.”- Jeremy Dooley on his stream (10/8/20)(via fuckyeahroosterteethproductions)
