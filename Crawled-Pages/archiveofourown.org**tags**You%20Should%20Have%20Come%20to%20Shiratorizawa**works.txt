    Summary
      (USHIJIMA X OC)They say that after making one thousand paper cranes you can make a wish and it will come true...---- Akiyama Umeko was a third year student at Shiratorizawa with one goal, to make one thousand paper cranes. This was her last year and she wanted to complete her goal. Umeko didn't really have much interest in anything other than the creative arts so it was only natural she didn't know much about volleyball. She had no reason to go to the gym, no reason to talk to the members of the club and certainly no reason to meet the captain of the team. However, a series of totally unplanned cliche events changed that.Soon she found herself very involved with the team and especially it's captain.

    Summary
      It is Sugawara Koushi's last year at Karasuno high, and things have not been going as smoothly as he would like. The first-years are troublesome, the genius first-year threatens to take his spot as starting setter. His caffeine addiction has been getting worse, and his anxiety has skyrocketed. When a spirit gifts the co-captain the Red String Of Fate, it did nothing but add to his list of worries. When he finally meets his destined partner, Oikawa Tooru, things seem to get worse. The Aoba Johsai captain makes a mistake which puts a curse on the both of them. Breaking the curse, to their dismay, is easier said than done.

      Sugawara Koushi didn’t particularly hope to get into Seijoh - but now that he did manage to get in, he’s determined to make the best of it. This will be his new start and even though making his way into Seijoh’s volleyball team’s starting lineup won’t be an easy task, Suga refuses to give up without a fight.It doesn’t help that the one he’ll be going up against is Oikawa Tooru, Kitagawa Daiichi’s star setter and the best setter of the entire prefecture. And it definitely does not help that said setter is determined to drag Suga out of the misery his middle school team left him in by any and all means necessary and somehow manages to win his heart over in the process.

    Summary
      This au found me and said "FUCK YOU WRITE NOTHING ELSE!" It all started as a one shot.I loved the world building, so I expanded it a multiple chapter story... Whoops! Sorry not sorry!Somehow, I made like... Harry Potter meets X-Men vibes in a magical alternate universe with the Haikyuu Cast? It do be a vibe tho.If your down for watching these idiots have magical powers while most have to keep their shit secret because some practices are illegal, (despite being born into certain magic practices) and having to fight and scheme to stay alive and safe I think you'll have a fucking blast here. Dumbassery is promised.Daichi said no more strays.Suga said fuck you, we have more children now.Everyone has magic(Well, almost everyone... yikes-eroni)Current favorite line in fic (Chpt 8): "Before I took an arrow to the knee," you started and he cut in, "(Y/n), it was a spear laced with a neurotoxin used in dragon infestations." "Learn to take a joke Akaashi.-"

    Summary
      hinata shouyou has made the three by far biggest mistakes of his life1. inviting the volleygays into one groupchat2. putting bokuto, kuroo, matsukawa, and hanamaki into said groupchat3. also adding iwaizumi hajime into that same groupchathe will probably never have a good night's rest because they cannot shut up, and kageyama wont either.hinata shouyou regrets making this group chat

    Summary
      "Finding a black feather: shielding, protection, boundaries and deflection of negative energies"-Joining Karasuno had been a no brainer considering you lived just down the road from the school. But what you didn't expect was to become such firm friends with two people who could not define 'chaotic good' more if they tried. And you certainly didn't expect to love one either.-Reader joins Karasuno at the same time as Tanaka and Noya and, taking pity on them, agrees to tutor them in English. Little did she know that this would be the start of the weirdest three years of her life. And maybe the most painful.

    Summary
      (OC x OIKAWA)“I’m resigning from the Volleyball Club.” Yana Iwaizumi used to love playing volleyball, but not anymore. She joined a team  as soon as she was old enough to play competitively. Unfortunately, for better or for worse they were always in the top three strongest schools.After a sudden school transfer to Aoba Johsai she vowed to never have anything to do with the Volleyball Club or it's incredibly popular captain and main setter, Oikawa. That's a little hard to do, especially when your cousin is the vice captain of the team and Oikawa's best friend.

    Summary
      Tendou stalks Ushijima home to become friends. Poor Ushijima is just like: What? Why are you following me? Why? Tall bean-child, why? Do you want to come in? Friends? Yes sure. Friendship is good. Why are you surprised I said yes? Why would you think I would say otherwise? We are on the same volleyball team; I think being friends would be beneficial. Well, it was nice having you over-wait. Where are you going? That’s not the way to the bathroom. Please bean-pole child, leave my house.
