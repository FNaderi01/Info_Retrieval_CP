Just because you’re too embarrassed to admit you’re not cool enough to be Rosa does not mean we cannot name this group chat that name. Besides, it’s a good name!Ide: Why am I here again?...In which Matsuda makes a group chat and all goes to chaos.

Also, can James stop flirting with the director?(Indefinite hiatus, I just feel super uninspired for this story. Slow updates to be expected, and they won't be long either.)

    Summary
      'I don’t remember ever being this tired.' Severus Snape is exhausted, he's tired of the life he leads and the people around him. He would do anything to kill the pain, anything. Even if it meant brewing a highly illegal potion and accidentally falling in love with a werewolf and an alcohol addict.

    Summary
      It's a world where your blood changes most everything. We are told that the lighter your blood the purer you are, the good. But as human nature foretells, we sin, and most live life with their blood forever muddied. The worst of the worse- the despicable, bleed the darkest black. This is the fact that L will use to his advantage, the winning factor that must prove that Light Yagami is indeed Kira. It has to. But things don't exactly go as planned, and fate has much in store for the pair than simply being rivals.

    Summary
      Soulmates? It’s better not mention you have a soulmate mark, unless you want to be ridiculed by the world. Hiding was your only option. But really, all Min Yoongi wanted to do was shout his love for Jung Hoseok from the rooftops - who cares about the rules? To be honest it was fun at first. It was their little secret, sharing soft smiles and stolen kisses. But as time went on, it became harder. Idol’s weren’t supposed to be in relationships in the first place — what would happen if the world found out about them?orSnapshots of Hoseok and Yoongi's relationship over the years they spent together.
