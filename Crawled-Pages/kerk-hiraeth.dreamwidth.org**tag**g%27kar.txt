G'Kar speaks for me.Dec. 11th, 2019 10:02 pm
 I have never been so depressed going in to an election day. Even if the Remain parties &amp; Labour do better than I expect this doesn't feel like my country anymore.For the second election in a row I will be forced to vote against something in order to, hopefully, keep a party from winning this constituency and if I'm still here if, or when, a second independence referendum comes I do not see myself voting to stay in the UK.I just wish I had the means to leave.We are throwing our freedom in the trash piece by piece.Did all those people who gave their lives for the right to vote really do it for this? "No dictator, no invader, can hold an imprisoned population by the force of arms forever. There is no greater power in the universe than the need for freedom. Against that power governments, and tyrants, and armies can not stand. .................. .................... Though it take a thousand years, we will be free." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJmuHNDcXLQ&amp;t=214s G'Kar; Babylon 5, S02E20 'The Long, Twilight Struggle' kerk hiraeth
