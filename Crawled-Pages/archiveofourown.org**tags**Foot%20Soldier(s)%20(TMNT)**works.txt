    Summary
      You smashed the light blue pills between your hands, smearing the powder across your splotchy red face and neck. The storm howled outside of the abandoned crumbling apartment, screaming and banging against the vibrating concrete walls. A determination glowed in your vacant eyes, though you felt nothing. Who were you to end an oppression that had been going on for far, far too long? Who were you to stand up to a man who had destroyed the lives of thousands?"I won't let you go out there alone." Raphael glowered at you, chewing on the nub of an aglow cigarette, ash tumbling from the tip. He clutched a handful of pills in the palm of his hand, glancing at the boarded up windows with the red stained plastic holding back the toxic gas of the storm.He opened his mouth to protest or swear; as you swung the butt of your gun across his face. He dropped to the ground, little blue pills tumbling across the sand covered floor. You carefully picked each up one by one, popping them all into your mouth. With that, you stepped over his body into the brewing poisonous sand storm, willing yourself to not look back.

    Summary
      In the Foot loyalty is preached above all else. Loyalty to the clan, loyalty to each other and to the Shredder.‘The Shredder’ is a title passed down from leader to leader.It is a title that can be inherited by blood, by being chosen or by victory in battle.Whoever kills the Shredder in combat inherits the title.Consequently the Foot Clan turns an enemy, into an ally.

It does not adhere to any specific 'verse.I am moving it here for it was deleted by staff at DA during the current witch hunt against certain writers/artists. Originally posted October 8th 2013 on FFN.Be aware of the warnings. This is a graphic heavy-themed multichapter. It is a harrowing depiction of obsession and the horrors love can manifest as. If you are sensitive, please do not read, this is not for you.
