      Erik Lehshnerr is a house flipper with a chip on his shoulder. His team, which he calls “The Brotherhood” is made up of Raven Darkholme and his son Peter Maximoff. 
Charles Xavier is an interior designer, who has a team made up of Scott Summers, Katherine Pryde, Ororo Munroe, and Jean Grey. He has to move out of his apartment, which throws him into Erik's arms and home.

    Summary
      Pot pourri de vignettes écrites à quatre mains, qui n'ont pas d'autre lien entre elles que d'être toutes un hommage à Erik et Charles, ces messieurs qui s'aiment et que Marcel Proust aurait appelés en d'autres lieux et à une autre époque des adeptes du Charlisme. (C'est ainsi que dans La Recherche, l'auteur dénomme les homosexuels, ce qui est en soi une trop belle coïncidence, n'est-il pas ?)

Then one day a powerful mutant with 3 minions arrives and saves him. Erik thought it was the happiest day of his life. However, when he found out that not only were the x-men were alive. The BROTHERHOOD was alive. He was heartbroken to find out that everyone moved on. Moved on from HIM. Naturally of course he….did NOT take it well.

    Summary
      There is a new serial killer in the Muggle world that has been killing DEATH EATERS for quite some time now. The killer is seemingly powerful with how using the spell Avada Kedavra. So the ministry of magic sends Logan to track him down and bring him ALIVE for trial. Because he is the best at what he does. However much to his surprise that the killer is a 14-year-old kid who only knows one spell, doesn't know what or who the death eaters are, doesn't know about the Wizard world…and he just escaped a concentration camp from Auschwitz.
