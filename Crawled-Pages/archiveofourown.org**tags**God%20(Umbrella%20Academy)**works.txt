    Summary
      The Horror is a being from another dimension. Reginald's tests confirmed that fact, but Ben always knew on some level. Just like Klaus can summon ghosts, he can summon beings from another dimension. At least, he could. Because Ben is gone. Vanya saw him dissolve, cross over into the light. And now an alternate-timeline version of him--some asshole in the Sparrow Academy--is running around with his face. But what is the light, what is heaven, but an alternate dimension? And if there's a carbon copy of Ben running around, one who can summon the Horror...well, there might just be a way to get Ben back after all. Or: What I want/need to happen in Season 3, but pretty much know won't. It doesn't hurt to dream.

    Summary
      On October first, twenty-nineteen—six months after the camp's mysterious closure—Camp Green Lake re-opens its doors to forty-three new (and old) campers.  This is all well and good, if not for the fact that there is something... fishy... going on behind the scenes.  Follow Luther, Diego, Allison, Klaus, [Redacted], Ben, and Vanya as they try to navigate the harsh desert, political machinations, and the depths of their own psyches to survive their sentences at Camp Green Lake.  It's a hard knock life for a bunch of delinquent kids, but perhaps they'll find some family in each other along the way.

“Why don’t you go take a look for yourself?” She nods over to the monochromatic house, gesturing for him to go inside.

    Summary
      “What the hell do you think you’re doing here?”The voice makes him freeze; he knew that voice, he knew it like the ocean knew sand. He never thought of this possibility, it was very stupid of him for not. “I could ask you the same thing,” he mumbles, refusing to face the man behind him.A bitter, humorless snort is heard and Klaus flinches subtly. “That’s rich,” Ben says, “coming from the person who stopped me from being here seventeen years ago.”The medium slumps in on himself a little; he was still mad, Ben was still mad… Why are they always fighting? Where did they go wrong?“You could have gone back anytime; it’s not my fault you were scared,” he mutters bleakly.“Yeah, right, because you didn’t need me? It’s apparent you couldn’t even make it a full day without me.”(Or the one where Ben and Klaus reunite in an unexpected way and talk about their differences. An apology was long overdue and third chance's the charm, he supposes.)

    Summary
      Klaus dies.Klaus dies, and Dave can't breathe. He forgets what it's like, the feeling of oxygen entering his lungs, the sensation of carbon dioxide exiting them.He remembers, though, the stories Klaus used to tell. He remembers that joke he'd made about that briefcase he always carried around being a time machine. He remembers the tall tales of a family of superpowers, a less than stellar father. He remembers the stories he'd spun out of thin air, of time travel and a disappearing brother and a talking chimpanzee and a robot mother.(He remembers the true story he'd told about seeing ghosts.)He only learns once he opens that mysterious briefcase under Klaus's cot that all of the stories were true.Every one of them.

Piece of cake. Spending eight days with his siblings? Absolutely impossible. Or, Klaus, a medium homicide detective, comes home to investigate the death of his father. He ends up having to deal with so much more than that.

    Summary
      "You said you didn't regret it," His voice wavers, the fear and dread churning in his stomach almost coming back up as he tries not to gag. "Just like Dad didn't." It's a low blow, a horrible thing to think let alone say out loud and the last time he'd said it Ben tackled him out of his body in anger. This time Ben shudders. "I didn't–" he says, uncertain and shaky, a whisper of the boy drenched in blood peeking through. "I just wanted...you wouldn't listen." ("I didn't mean to," Six said, wide-eyed and shivering, hands hugging his stomach.) Klaus hides the tears in the crook of Ben's neck and says, "I know." Or, in which the bullet kills Five too, leading to a heart to heart between Four and Six and Klaus Immortality doesn't just extend to himself.
