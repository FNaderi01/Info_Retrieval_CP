A Downton WorldAug. 10th, 2012 10:53 pm
osprey_archerAnother entry in my ongoing quest to make everyone watch Downton Abbey: I present a link to A Downton World, which is Downton Abbey remixed with A Softer World. It is all awesome, but this one is my favorite:(Sybil does not of course actually say this in the show, but it totally fits her character. This is why Sybil is my favorite. Except for maybe Branson. And Mary. And Daisy, because she's such an adorable goofball...okay, I totally love them all.) Also! You know what would make a great Downton crack fic? Thomas Barrow, Vampire Footman. I mean, look at him. So pale and broody and evil! Clearly vampire material!
