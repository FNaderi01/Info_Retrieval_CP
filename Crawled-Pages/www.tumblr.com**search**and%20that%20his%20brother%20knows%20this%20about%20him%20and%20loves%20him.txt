                    Most recentMost popularMost recentFilter by post typeAll postsTextPhotoQuoteLinkChatAudioVideoAskGrid ViewList ViewI know I’m a few years late to the Gravity Falls party, but I can’t get over how effectively the Ford reveal flips the switch on Stan’s character. From what little I’d seen of the show on Tumblr before I watched it, I’d always assumed Stan was a pretty one-dimensional sleazy con man. And since it was a series aimed toward kids, I kind of assumed Stan wouldn’t get that much development or story outside of Dipper and Mabel. I figured if he did have an arc, it would be the pretty common “gruff bitter loner guy who doesn’t like people gets kids and learns to love them” storyline. And for like the first half of the show, this kind of seemed to be the case, aside from the mystery surrounding whatever Stan was hiding in the basement.And then the Ford reveal / backstory happens and you see Stan in a completely new light. Stan isn’t a con man because he wants to be. He’s a con man out of necessity - first because he was kicked out of his house and forced to make it on his own at 18, and then because it was helping him work to bring his brother back. He doesn’t just run the mystery shack because he likes to lie to people and swindle them out of their money - he does it because he needed a way to make money and keep the shack while trying to figure out a way to reopen the portal. He has a fake identity because he needed to keep people from snooping around looking for Stanford and the easiest way to do that was to take his place.All the things that make you think he’s selfish and shady throughout the first half of the series are revealed to be because he’s a desperate, heartbroken man who wants to bring his brother back. He isn’t the traditional gruff guy who doesn’t love anyone until some rambunctious kids come into his life at all - he loves his brother so much that literally everything he does is to get him back. And he lies to the kids in an effort to protect them and keep anything bad from happening to them like it did to his brother.Great twists / mystery reveals don’t just take the story in a new direction - they cast new light on everything that has come before. And Gravity Falls does that so well.Just look at one of the first episodes in the series where Mabel makes a wax figure of Stan and Stan appears to fall in love with it and mourns it when it melts, going as far to host a funeral for it. Without knowing Stan’s backstory, this whole storyline just feeds into our view of Stan as a self-centered, ridiculous person. It’s ridiculous he would cherish a wax figure of himself. It’s so egotistical that he would host a funeral for it when it died and get honestly choked up about it.But then you learn that Stan lost his twin brother and that whole storyline doesn’t really feel like the story of a selfish, egotistical man anymore. It’s the story of a man who felt like he got his brother back again momentarily and then had to lose him all over again.That’s an effective twist. You can’t learn about Stan’s backstory and then go back and view him the same way you did before it.

“It was my friend’s birthday, and everyone else was twenty-one except for me. So we went to a bar that wouldn’t check ID. It was called ‘The Clif Tavern,’ and it was a total dive. The cash register was from 1948. The owner was an old, weathered guy named Skip. He seemed very excited to have customers. He told us stories all night long. He talked about meditation, and racing cars, and being a black belt. I remember he was really proud that his brother’s dog had been in a movie with Cameron Diaz. By the time we left, all of us were in love with the place. We started coming back every weekend. And I was hanging around so much that Skip offered me a job as a bartender. He didn’t teach me much. He knew very little about business. He kept all his documents in an empty Budweiser box. But he was the spirit of the place. He gave great hugs. He called everyone his ‘kids.’ And he was a total hippie. Whenever he posted on social media, he’d sign it ‘Peace and Love.’ We worked together for ten years. Skip was with me when I met my husband. He witnessed our first kiss. He became like a father figure to me. And his bar became a huge part of my life as well. Skip used to always say that the bar was ‘killing him,’ and he kept threatening to move to Costa Rica. But he could never stay away for long. There were maybe six days in ten years that he didn’t come to the bar. So when he didn’t show up one evening, everyone knew that something was wrong. The police went to his apartment and found him unresponsive. He’d died of a heart attack. None of us knew what to do. I gave the eulogy at his funeral, and then left to go open the bar. All of us assumed it was the end of everything. But one month after the funeral, I got a call from Skip’s brother. He said he couldn’t sell Skip’s legacy to a stranger, so he offered the bar to me and my husband. Over the past few months we’ve renovated everything. We have a new tap system now. We’ve added a modern register. We’ve made a lot of changes, because we know that it needs to be an actual business if it’s going to survive. But we’ve also covered an entire wall with Skip’s photos and notes. Because we always want the place to feel like Skip.”

            the demons brothers + a touch starved mc        LuciferIf you’re going to Lucifer because you’re touch starved, then you’re definitely going to be close to him already – he doesn’t let just anyone touch him.…….He’s also touch starved but won’t admit it, so one of you is gonna just have to bite the bullet and make a move.(It’s gonna have to be you)You’re going to have to go about this carefully–make a really good plan and then execute it flawlessly.Literally just throw yourself at him. He’ll catch you. Probably.Nothing says ‘give me affection’ quite like yeeting yourself off the staircase at him, and he definitely understands what you want when you latch on tight to him like a weird little barnacle that he cant peel off no matter how hard he tries dfghjkkgfHe’s really warm and he smells Really nice and he hugs you so tight, like it’s the last chance he’ll ever get, so he’s honestly one of the best snuggle buddies. He’s gonna act all fussy about your love-attack at first–just play with his hair and smother him with lots of kisses and he won’t be able to resist snuggling u. Or banging u, but that’s your choiceY’know, because “demons can’t resist temptation” and all that jazz. (tbh he just likes likes you alot)Mammon…Why are you staring at him like you wanna eat him?Seriously, knock it off, you’re freaking him out!Wait, why are you coming closer…? Get Back you Fiend don’t you DARE wrap your arms around him and nuzzle your face into his chest like that what the FU–…Oh.Huh. This is kinda nice.(Just hug him. If you want his affection, just wrestle him into a bear hug and don’t. let. go.)At first, Mammon doesn’t really understand affection that isn’t along the lines of a friendly/loving punch. He’s not used to kindness. It’s a fucking tragedy. He doesn’t know how to ask for love because I don’t think he even realizes thats an option, tbh. He’s kind of like an unsocialized puppy–will definitely put up a fight until he realizes that, hey, being snuggled is nice.Luckily for Mams, you are touch starved and determined to show his stupidass what affection is supposed to be like. He’s going to get so blushy. Sooo blushy. He totally pretends to not like it at first, but inside he’s over the fucking moon happy.It takes him a while, but eventually, he realizes that he can ask you for snuggles too. At first he’s all “C’mere human, I bet you’re just itchin’ for me to hug ya, so let me make all your dreams come true!”(It’s a defense mechanism.)But over time, he eventually seeks you out and just flops on top of ya, and doesn’t feel the need to make a big show about it.He feels safe with you, and that’s priceless.

I think one of the reasons why I find such a sharp divide in the approach to Magnus Archives analysis and character interpretation is that some are viewing it as a cautionary tale, while others view it as commentary on an unfair system.On one hand, you have people who look at the events in the story, and see the unfairness and contradiction in the suffering throughout.  What saves someone in one story damns them in another; sometimes love snatches someone from the jaws of death, and sometimes love just makes the pain inflicted sweeter to the entity consuming it.  Tim sums this up so well in the last recording he gave before his death, exhausted and furious by the impossibilities of the deck stacked against humanity:  Tim:  I used to blame myself for not helping him.  But now… now it doesn’t matter.  I’ve read through enough of these things to know that this doesn’t matter.  The only thing you need to have your life destroyed by this stuff is just bad luck.  Talk to the wrong person, take the wrong train, open the wrong door, and that’s it!  (TMA 117)And then on the other, you have people trying to mold it into a cautionary tale, primarily about its protagonist: Jon brought his victimization on himself because he was too curious, too stupid, too unlikable; he should have just walked away, he should have left the Institute without Martin, he should have been more like [insert character here] and everything would have been better.  I think this view is common among fans because it’s one expressed by a fan favorite, that is generally considered a level-headed and wise outside perspective:Georgie:  Jumping on a grenade is only heroic if you weren’t the one who actually threw it.Martin:  That’s not what’s happening.Georgie:  Okay.  It’s still not something I want any part of.  (TMA 149)It’s uncomfortable to view Georgie as in the wrong here, because then it becomes simple textbook victim-blaming.  It’s easier for fans to take her words as fact in contrast to an angry and despairing Tim towards the end of his life.  But the key difference in their perspectives is information.  Tim used to think his brother was a cautionary tale, that he was a cautionary tale, but after studying dozens of cases realized it wasn’t true–they were simply victims through and through.  If Danny didn’t lead an adventurous life that led him to abandoned theaters, he could have still met a horrible fate as a real estate agent or commuting to a boring office job.  In contrast, Georgie starts with limited information, then refuses to hear any that may threaten her worldview.While it can function on a (very harsh) one-by-one character analysis level, the cautionary tale framework starts to fall apart as soon as you zoom out to the story and themes as a whole.  Is this really a story about how trying to learn and understand is a bad thing, like some kind of weird anti-science ‘we should just keep our heads down and stop questioning things’ enforcement of the status quo?  What worth would be in that message?  Is this a story about how you’re a bad person if you struggle to connect to others, or is it one about how cold and brutal systems break down our communities and pit us against each other?  Is it an exploration of how even if you’re trapped in a situation, you can still fight to care for each other and do the right thing, or is it “this other person was able to escape, so if you’re trapped it must be because you did something wrong”?

Before I start this idea was created by the AMAZING @rrasado check her out her art is beautiful. And @makeapactwithme helped me out with Belphie since I had a hard time figuring him out. So check her out too. She has amazing writing! Thank you all for your support I read all the comments. Even the tags!Here’s the relationships between the brothers. Obey Me Flipped AUAn alternate universe where the Obey Me brothers have opposite personalities. The characters have the same abilities and represent the same sins as the Cannon. Lucifer The Fun Loving First BornYou can’t seem to get under Lucifer’s skin no matter how hard you try. He always seems to shrug it off or mange to make a joke out of it. Much to the annoyance of his younger brothers. After falling and making a deal with Diavolo, Lucifer decided to make the best of his situation. He became more lax and adventurous. He now tries to pawn off his work to his brothers or MC. Now he’s way too care free and causes trouble because he has mountains of responsibility and just pawns it off on everyone else. Lucifer loves to go out with Diavolo and have fun. He’s always pulling Diavolo out of the office to party. Still has a hate club dedicated to him the “Lucifer You Suck Club” still runs strong. Signature move is to laugh as he walks away. Infuriates everyone. Loves coffee but doesn’t need it at all. Always makes sure to have at least 8 hours of rest. Has mountains of self controlReally no one can make him mad He still cares about his brothers and is protective over them. MammonThe No Nonsense Second BornMammon is stone faced, hardworking, and always ready to talk someone out of their money. Being the second born he’s the one who has to pick up after Lucifer and help his younger brothers. Broke? No. This man is always loaded because he’s a smooth talker and knows what he’s doing. Has grown cynical due to his brothers and has honestly thought about selling them off. Has many ‘Goldies’ each one is used for different purposes so he can keep track of things easier. Has a black card for replacing things his brothers broke. Hates to be messy, hates disorganization, and hates engery drinks. Had to rely on them a lot. Got sick because of them and now even the smell makes him dizzy. Do not make puns around him.He will not speak to you. Is the most responsible of the brothers. Is upfront about how he feels. Hates you? You’ll be written a letter on why. Likes you? Sits down with you and tells you everything he adores about you. Tells MC daily how much he appreciates them helping him out with paperwork. Funny enough the witches he’s made pacts with are very helpful. Always bring him tributes and bring him heeps of money to help. Leviathan The God Complex Third BornHe’s the Otaku Overlord. The God of Anime and gaming. You disagree? Well you’re just a little worthless ant. And ants are easy to squish so shut your mouth. He started working as a streamer and has been on the incline ever since. People are afraid of his confidence and skill. But is still wildly popular. He does commercials for his favorite energy drinks, headphones, gaming systems keyboards. The works. Put his face on it? You’ll be sold out quickly. Laughs in people’s faces when they try to mock him. Will then proceed to make a mockery out of them. And smile at them while he does it. “Ruri-chan can rule besides me over these chumps.”Causes the second most amount of trouble for Mammon. Lucifer being the first. Uses “I’m not mad.” And “Thats nothing compared to me!” A lot.Has to be better than everyone in the room he will become physically ill if someone is better at something. Tries to hold MC’s hand as much as possible. To show off he’s so amazing that even humans love him. Huge show offHas a ring of one of his fallen off scales. Claims that its a devildom treasures that may only belong in his hands. Will only let MC touch if if they ask. SatanThe Scatterbrained Fouth Born Satan is a bubbly guy with a flashy appearance to match his personality. But because of Satan’s flashly looks and known wrathful outbursts people are horribly afraid to talk with him and he can’t seem to figure out why. He really wants to go out but has almost no friends besides his brothers so he ends up staying inside and reading. Satan is distracted really easily and tries really hard to focus. Tell him a joke and its a 50-50 on he laughs or just doesn’t get it. Small details just fly over his head. Doesn’t care to look either. One minute he’s over here looking up what a word means the next he’s reading about why lobsters turn red when you cook them. Misplaces paperwork constantly. Doesn’t understand why people are scared of him. Is wildly smart. Just in random things. Mostly because of his random dancing around in subjects. Takes a lot of effort to get him motivated to do work. Mammon has to bribe him a lot to do his student counsel duties. Looks to MC for help with social situations. Lucifer You Suck Club member Helps Mammon out with the duties dumbed on him by Lucifer. But pay up. He wants a new watch, a new book, a new-Gets mad when people tease him about him loosing things he has in his hands. Don’t do that. Don’t. Asmodeus The Modest Fifth BornShy, bashful, and easily flustered. Asmo is the most quiet and least troublesome brother. He goes out with people vary rarely and has an ever harder time making real connections with people. He has a hard tine getting to know or even approaching new people but is still able to seduce to get what he needs. He spends most of his time in his fantasies by writing, painting, or watching movies. Compliment him? All red in the face. Tell him he’s pretty. He’s red. He just mumbles a thanks. Looks to be an angel still but underneath is a depraved sex maniac. If interrupted Asmo calmly slam the door and continue what he was doing. Don’t bother his “private time” Has social media but doesn’t post pictures of himself at all. But if his face is seen in the post people go nuts. Hams up the innocent act so people don’t think badly of him. Did I say to not interpret his “private time”?Don’t do it. Has a hard time making meaningful relationships.Beelzebub The Untrusting Sixth Born Hard cold glares and a huge frown is what is normally on Beel’s face. After becoming a demon Beel decided that the world is a cruel horrible place and the only thing good in it was his brothers and food. Now he really only wants to keep to himself and eat in peace but his brothers won’t have it. He ends up being pulled along by one of them to have fun. Food is the only thing that can be trustedKnown to be a demon lie detector. But he can just read others well. Has a personality Dislikes when someone tries bribes him with food. Reminds you he’s not an animal to be tamed. Will still take the food cause its not the foods fault. Then just doesnt do it. When Belphie was sent to the human world he became a whole lot meaner. Did not like MC from the start. Had a feeling they were using the brothers. When Belphie came back he calmed down a whole lot. Belphegor The Always Smiling Seventh Born So tired all the time. Belphegor drinks what seems to be gallons of caffeine everyday so he can help with whatever needs to be done that day. But ends up in a overly tired state. He’s the peace keeper of the brother’s and one of the friendliest. But please don’t use his mug. That’s HIS mug. Chugs energy drinks and makes Mammon deeply uncomfortable. Is constantly doting on MC and his brother. Loves MC and Beel to pieces and will let the world know. Tries to stay away but ends up falling asleep in school council meets and at the dinner table. Has a cow print mug that he always has on him brimming with coffee or some caffeine drink.Helps Mammon the most. Doesnt need a huge bribe. “I’ll make you some human world espresso” but Belphie is already there. Lucifer you suck member. Hates Lucifer but with a smile :).

The brothers when MC calls them ‘Baby Boy’Thank you @mammons-creditcard for sparking this idea.LuciferYou get very different results depending on if you call him that in public or in private. Call him that in public and he will respond with the most intense eyebrow raise ever. “What did you just call me?” His voice very stern and you know he will punish you for it later.However, if you call him that in private when the two of you are alone, he will let out an affectionate sigh, walk closer to you, and take your hand.“You are probably the only one in all the realms who can call me that and live to tell the tale.” His voice surprisingly affectionate as he pulls you into a hug. He will also call you by a ‘silly little pet name’ as he calls it but only when you two are alone.MammonMammon wasn’t expecting to be called baby boy in a million years so when you say it he stops whatever he is doing and looks at you. He doesn’t know how to respond until he gets this cocky smile on his face.“Of course you would call me that! After all, I’m the great Mammon and you’re my human!“He will honestly be so happy and he gets butterflies in his stomach whenever you call him that. He gets a little embarrassed if you say it in public but he loves it because it shows the whole world how much you care about him, he will also call you baby (boy/girl).“Come on baby ya have been working all night. Give ya baby boy some affection will ya!”LeviWhen you say it he has to take a double-take, did you just call him grandmaster otaku and the ‘Grand Admiral of The Hell’s Navy’ baby boy? You sure did. He’ll be blushing and mumbling like crazy which makes him even more adorable to you.“Y- you can’t just call demons that out of nowhere!” He’ll yell at you but you can tell from his face that he loves it.It takes him quite some time to get used to it but when he does he’ll try to give you a pet name too. The first time he tries it the poor thing chokes on his words, and calls you his ‘Henry’, you find it hilarious and very adorable, in the meantime, he is ready to move to the bottom of a lake and never come out again. Though when you hug him he gets a bit more confidant.“Y- yes you are my… Henry, if anyone has a problem with that I’ll unleash Lothan upon them!”SatanHearing you say those words to him he puts the book he was reading down and an amused smile appears on his face.“Oh? Where did you get the idea to call me that?” He sais teasing you, before grabbing you and pulling you closer. Would it have been anybody else he would have gotten quite annoyed, but since it’s you he can’t help but find it adorable.He will let you call him that whenever you want, as long as you are okay with him calling you ‘Kitten’. After all, it is no fun when it’s just him that is flustered, he’s going to try his best to make you blush just as much, if not more than he is.“Come my kitten, why don’t you rest your head on my lap for a little while.”AsmoHe is used to being called all sorts cute pet names but that doesn’t mean that he finds it any less adorable. When he hears you say it he wants to jump in your arms but he is a bit too enthusiastic and ends up tackling you to the ground.“You are so adorable, do you know me that? Please call me that as much as you like!”You two end up cuddling on the floor since neither of you wants to get up. He starts to call you every cute name he knows to see which one he likes the best, but they all sound so adorable and he can’t choose. So he decides to kiss you all over that adorable face of yours, to show you how happy you have made him.”“Oh my darling, your words are like music to my ears. I’ll make sure you’ll feel just as loved as I do!”BeelHe stops eating to look at you, the biggest and warmest smile appears on his face as you call him ‘baby boy’. He quickly walks over to you and pulls you into a tight warm hug.“I don’t think anyone has ever called me that before. I like it!” He wants to show you just how much those words mean to him, so he will hug you for as long as you want and he even kisses you on the top of your head.When he stops hugging you he still has that wonderful smile on his face. He then offers you a bit of his food, by feeding it to you. Seeing you eat out of his hand makes his smile even brighter. “That was really adorable, but I’m not quite satisfied. Do you think you could call me ‘baby boy’ again?” You can’t deny him such a sweet request so you call him baby boy as much as he wants. He thinks of a cute name to call you and ends up going for ‘babycakes’, your heart practically mets as the words escape his lips.BelphieAt first, he thinks he’s dreaming but after a few seconds, he realizes that you actually said it. A grin appears on his face as he moves closer to you.“So I’m your baby boy? That’s very cute, why don’t you come over here so we can cuddle together?”You happily fulfill his request and lay next to him, he quickly wraps his arms around you and pulls you closer to him. You can hear him laugh as he places a quick kiss to the back of your head. He smiles to himself as you nestle yourself against him.“You’re so adorable, I don’t think I want to let you go. So for tonight, you can sleep in the arms of your baby boy.” He sais as you both drift off to sleep.

deanobeanoqueero  asked:Hey heyyy!~ I hope you're doing well! May I request a short hc of the brothers seeing MC cuddled up in their jacket? Maybe they had a long day or just got sleepy and hey, the jacket was just laying around. Please remember to take care of yourself! ❤Hi hiiiiii! I’m well, thanks for asking! I’ve eaten well lately (with Beel and friend encouragement) and been getting plenty of sleep. This was a fun one to write!! I included the setup too bc I had so many ideas and…. MC is absolutely a jacket stealing thief &lt;3LuciferHe had left it on the back of his dining room chair while he cleaned up after dinner, since it was his turnWhich you saw as the perfect opportunity to steal it for cuddle time, of courseHe finds you asleep at your desk, your head on your folded arms and breath slow, having dozed off while studying (you only meant to close your eyes for a moment, you swear)Well… clearly you needed rest. And he refuses to be the reason you don’t get enough sleep and miss class the next day.Any anger he feels about having his jacket taken away is overwritten by warm fuzziesYou wanted his jacket….. for company while you studied…. it’s immeasurably cute. He absolutely blushesHe’ll collect his jacket the next day and leave you to your snoozeMammonYou can find his jacket lying around anywhere, he has a habit of just… leaving things around.You’ve seen his room haven’t you??? Mammon comes home from a shift at Hell’s Kitchen and tosses it aside while he undresses to go showerYoink, your jacket nowYou lay in his bed, in his jacket, surrounded by his scent while you wait for him to finish getting cleaned upSecond best thing to real Mammon cuddlesOh and he loves seeing you in his stuff“Wha- hey, what do you think you’re doin’?” turns really quickly into “…. Guess it makes sense you wanna wear my stuff, since I’m your first and you wanna let everyone know!”LeviathanYou won jacket privileges after beating Levi’s ass in Ruri-chan Racer ten times in a rowHe is so distracted by the sight of you in his jacket - because holy fuck this is like, top tier romantic stuff…!!!He definitely loses round 11and 12and 13 and 14 and he finally has to call it quits“Aww, what’s the matter Levi, tired of losing?”Levi blushes so hard“No! I mean, yes, but - I wanna watch something with you instead! Andmaybecuddlealittleokaythanks”More beneath the cut! Keep reading

-Enola and Sherlock continue to use the newspaper method of leaving secret messages to contact each other their Mother was using. At first, it is just for cases, and then it develops into a game of who can leave the most complicated puzzle. People are always confused by random messages that appear. -Enola  occasionally pretends to be engaged to Lord Tewksbury on cases to get into places she wouldn’t normally be accepted. Tewksbury just goes with it and never objects when anyone asks him about it. “I met your fiancé the other day while she was on luncheon at the club.” “Umm….er…right. Yes.” No one knows if they actually are engaged and people are incredibly confused by it. Enola still lives by herself and makes a living solving crimes. -Enola can’t bake for anything, but when she finds out Lestrade likes Strawberry pastries, she bribes him with them from the bakery nearby where she lives. Sherlock tries this once, but it isn’t the same place, and the pastries are terrible and do not have the desired effect.  -Also Lestrade has a score board of times Enola has beat Sherlock on solving a case. Enola is three points ahead. -Mycroft frequently is told that “his brother” visited his office to get something, and in reality, its Enola sneaking into steal files or other things. -Boys sometimes look for her if they need to make a quick buck because she takes old clothes from them for her disguises. -Lady Tewksbury once joins Enola on a case and becomes her assistant and the two work together really well -Enola is the one that frequently convinces Mrs. Hudson to stay when Sherlock is in one of his moods. She’s exceptionally good at flower arrangements, and sends them to her under Sherlocks name which Sherlock has yet to figure out. He just thinks Mrs. Hudson has excellent patience. -When John Watson comes into the picture, Enola bets Sherlock five pounds that he’ll stay. After their first case together, Watson notices Sherlock hand her five pounds after she leaves for tea.

anonymous asked:I know Jaskiers dad being a big bitch is accepted fanon but I just really like the idea of the whole family just being like That. Very academically brilliant and have the combined common sense of a very confused and loving dog.Oh my gosh I love this?Jaskier’s family are all creatively or academically brilliant in different, highly specific areas, flighty as hell with a lackadaisical attitude to their own well being, getting over attached to basically everyone they come across who’s even a little bit intriguing? Coming home at winter is like going to a fucking university fair where they’re all talking over each other like  look at this new painting - and I discovered a new star - this amazing song about him - and it had eighteen legs instead of the supposed sixteen - and none of them really listen to the others but they all have an amazing timeGeralt comes with Jaskier one year and is ready for the usual oh no scary witcher reception but they’re all fascinated with him for different reasons. Jaskier’s brother is obsessed with the dye he uses in his armour and his sister insists on knowing who forged his swords, and his little niece gets out all of her books and demands he tells her exactly how long it takes a rotfiend to explode - to the nearest second, please - and his father takes him up to the astronomy tower and his uncle goes on a tangent about how he’s got the perfect posture for this new painting – By the end of the evening, Geralt is so fucking tired, and Jaskier makes excuses and bundles him up and pushes him into bed full of apologies, terrified that his family has scared his long-suffering witcher off, but Geralt thinks they’re brilliant - if exhausting.(the only one who isn’t like this is his mum, who is the single most competent woman on the entire continent because she has to make sure none of them wander off the edge of a cliff while lost in thought)

            Pinned        Arvin Russell x readerSummary: Your relationship with Arvin was complicated, but he liked you. You weren’t proper which his grandma hated, but no one knew the shy, submissive side that Arvin knew, he fucking loved it. Warning: smut (unprotected—which is bad wrap dem willies :) ), language, mentions of death, dom/sub sorta, beating people upI lost another bet to @vanillacupcake and @soft-petey suggested the idea and I don’t mind at all😌You ran a hand through your hair as you helped your younger brother out of the car. He held the side of your dress as you held the plate of cookies, to take to the church. Your family isn’t religious, but everyone brings food to the church some times. You held the tray of cookies, making your way up the steps with your six year old brother, Dean, beside you. He was only coming so you can drop him at the church so his friends mom can take them to the park. The noises from the crowd outside brought you back. The town wasn’t big, everyone knew everyone , doesn’t mean they all got along. “There’s your friend right?” You said, pointing at his friend.“Yea okay bye.” Dean ran off to his friend, you smiled politely at his friends mom, who returned a nod. “Jesus fuck.” You sighed.

gnomeicecream  asked:You have feelings about the mask? I want to know your feelings about the mask.oh godsomeone’s poor gifset has an essay of my tags underneath it but i just really loved the creative choice of mask because maskfirst, the fact that they choose to make it silver, which in traditional chinese opera would usually represent a demon, a ghost, or a spirit, which is very fitting for wei wuxian in the beginning because you could technically say he has been all three (plus gold and silver mainly symbolize mystery, so from the very start of the drama, we are explicitly being told that wei wuxian has a dark past™)then, it’s the fact that wei wuxian is wearing a masksomewhere in my meta tag there is an entire essay about the ambiguity of wei wuxian’s position in the cultivation world, a top disciple who will never lead his own sect, sometimes jiang fengmian’s adopted son, sometimes a son of a servant, jiang yanli’s brother to some people, a possible romantic attachment to others, always shifting and fluid, who he is and what he is always depending on other people’s perspective of himwei wuxian plays a thousand and one roles, from an adopted brother who was never adopted, to the evil yiling patriarch who grows radishes out of piles of corpses, so his entire life prior to his death is just a continuous swapping of figurative masks when you watch all the flashbacks and then return to the beginning, the mask suddenly means so much more, because this time it’s physical, and this time, the first time in his life, wei wuxian is just himself he is open with lan wangji, he is honest with jiang cheng, he is affectionate with jin ling and blunt with the juniors, he is done playing rolesi mean, people always laugh about that mask because it shouldn’t have actually prevented anyone from recognizing him, but it did, because only a very small, small number of people actually knew wei wuxian without a mask (so the creative choice of lan wangji being the first to recognize him is made all the more significant)and on a light note, I just think that the whimsical design of it, slightly grotesque from some angles and kind of cute and mischievous from others, is a perfect reflection of wei wuxian’s personality

            The Demon Brothers + comforting a self-conscious MC/Reader        So a while ago an anon sent me the below askAnd I kind of adored the idea, considering I am also insecure, and chubby, and in need of some demon bro comfort. Hence, here we are.Rather than bullet point, I ended up writing short stories for each brother. Hopefully you still enjoy 💕Lucifer:The eldest brother is
not unaware of the way your eyes stray when the two of you are in public
together—your gaze raking over the other inhabitants of the Devildom as you
traverse the busy streets.At first, he assumes
the array of creatures—some far less human-like than he and his brothers—are
interesting to you. Then, he notices the way you begin hugging yourself with
your arms. As if trying to hide yourself away from any prying eyes.It is indeed out of
place for a human to be seen in the Devildom, and you do get some stares,
but…he has a suspicion that the sudden shyness you exhibit stems from
feelings that reach beyond what strangers may think of you.He doesn’t like seeing
you in such a state.“Y/N,” he addresses
you after tugging you into a small, scarcely populated side alley. One of his
gloved fingers curls beneath your chin, and he guides your hung head to look at
him. “I can tell you’re upset. Explain to me why.”You glance away from
him, cheeks heating up, and your arms hugging your sides a bit tighter.“I just…you, and
your brothers are all so beautiful,” you start by saying, causing him to blink
in surprise. “And…whenever we’re out like this, and I see all of the other
demons living here, I can’t help but feel like I pale in comparison…”Lucifer’s features
soften as he stares at you. You’re worried about such a silly thing?“Y/N.” He steps
forward, his thumb moving to hold your chin. He tilts your head up, guiding you
into a kiss. It’s soft, and loving, and immediately your fingers are twitching
against your sides—itching to reach out and hold him.“You are perfect as
you are, and I have never thought otherwise.”He kisses you again,
his free arm moving to curl around your waist and tug you closer. You feel your
heart aching in your chest.“Lucifer—”“You need not compare
yourself to others, because there is no one else like you—and you are radiant
in every sense of the word. I give you my word as the Avatar of Pride that what
I speak is the absolute truth.”His voice is quiet,
and tender, and full of adoration. You feel like crying.“I love you,” you whisper the words against him, voice a little
broken, and Lucifer smiles before kissing you again. He will try his best from
now on to help you feel a little more comfortable in your own skin.Mammon:The second brother invites you to Majolish to watch one of his
fashion shoots, and you agree despite knowing how self conscious it will make
you, because you know it will make him
happy.So, you find yourself standing in the back of the studio, watching
Mammon on the temporary set—which is composed of an oversized mattress, and
colorful pillows. He’s wearing slacks, and a button up that’s not buttoned at
all—revealing his toned body. Since it’s a group shoot, he’s surrounded by
equally enticing male and female demons. And while the sight should get you
going, considering they’re all so attractive, it just makes you feel…bad.Biting your lip, a sick feeling rising in your chest, you end up
stepping out into the hall. Mammon finds you there soon after, a look of relief
on his face when he spots you with your back against the wall—arms hugged
together.“There ya are! I thought you had left!” He runs up to greet you,
but his smile wavers. He can tell you’re upset—gaze straying away from him. “Hey, what’s wrong?” He reaches out, hands hovering nervously. Had
he done something? “I…if I did something wrong you can tell me…I didn’t
mean to upset ya—”“No, it’s not you,” you mumble, cutting him off. Now he’s even
more confused. “I guess…I got upset seeing you and all the models. I know I
don’t look anywhere near as attractive, and that thought started to gnaw at me,
so—”“What are ya talking about?” he interrupts you, head cocked to the
side curiously. “I think you’re hot as hell.”You feel your cheeks heat up, surprised at his words. “What?”“I-I mean!” suddenly he’s turning red, hand lifting to sheepishly
rub at his neck. “I’ve never thought that ya weren’t attractive, ya know? Ever
since you came here my heart can’t help but flutter whenever I see ya…”Your heart aches. “Mammon…”“Listen! I just…,” his shy gaze turns back to you, and he reaches
a hand out, cupping your cheek. “I think you’re one of the most beautiful
things I’ve ever seen.”He leans in, but hesitates for a moment, so you’re the one who
ends up sealing the kiss.“Don’t worry about that kinda crap, okay?” he whispers against
you, his arms lowering to wrap around your waist—holding you tightly. “Or else
The Great Mammon will have to start knocking some sense into that silly human
brain of yours.”Tears blot your eyelashes, but you can’t help but giggle. Keep reading

I am like, nothing short of absolutely disgusted at Bryke’s portrayal of Katara in the comics and TLOK???And apparently a majority of the audience is okay with this portrayal??Just a recap:This is KataraA girl with severe abandonment issues because her mom was murdered by a Fire Nation soldier and soon after her dad left to fight in the war, leaving her alone to take care of her brother and the village.This is Aang A boy with chronic running away issues. This fault of his has led to a war extending up to 100 years causing death and destruction all around the world.Katara does not acknowledge this fault of his because she idolises him as the Avatar but still his actions hurt her. A lot.Katara: It’s not brave, it’s selfish and stupid! We could be helping him and I know the world needs him, but doesn’t he know how much we need him, too? How can he just leave us behind?Logically speaking, a person with abandonment issues should never be with a person who has a tendency to run away from their issues. But Aang and Katara get together anyway.But then the comics happen.Literally anyone who cared about Katara as a character of her own (and not just as Aang’s love interest) was infuriated at how she was portrayed. She was stripped of all her autonomy and characterization and was made into “The Avatar’s Girlfriend”. Nothing of her own.Some people actually call this relationship sweet. Yuck.But the thing is, it has panels like this:Katara, the girl with abandonment issues looks— that’s right, abandoned and forgotten.Even if the “abandonment issues” angle is thrown out of the window, the above panel from Katara’s pov is a very unhealthy and shitty experience. (I can vouch with personal experience)When you clearly don’t have anyone else and the one person who you completely dedicate yourself to is completely avoiding you in favour of other people who don’t really matter that much just because it makes them feel better/superior, how lonely and abandoned does that make you feel?Also this sort of behaviour is undeniably selfish and self centred.This problem of “Aang paying more attention to fangirls” exists in the show as well but atleast Aang corrects his behaviour or accepts that it was incorrect. The comics however:Katara, who was abandoned, ignored and lonely in this entire comic is reasonably upset about this. But instead of the comic validating her feelings, it makes her feel guilty???What the fuck??If this isn’t a fulfilment of the male fetish of gfs/wives putting their own mental issues and feelings on a back bench just for the sake of the man’s hApPineSs, then what is this?Not to mention this fetish is pretty disgusting.This is what young kids are supposed to learn form the comics?This is harmful for boys AND girls.But sure couple goals and soulmates or whatever.Moving on, The very existence of LOK!Katara is just— Like what—?This definitely isn’t the Katara I know and love.Katara, who was completely devastated by her mother’s death but got her shit together immediately and seamlessly slipped into the role of her mother and was so damn good at it that her elder brother could conveniently use his coping mechanism to supress their mother’s memories with Katara’s instead.You’re telling me this same girl grew up to be a sad old lonely widow who spent her days and nights wallowing in the grief of the death of her husband—Bullshit.That’s straight up romanticization of “life is nothing without you” trope where the wife just becomes a non-functional person after the death of her husband. That, and Bryke not giving a shit about Katara’s character.There’s the evident drama of Aang ignoring his two other kids in favour of the Airbending one; leaving Katara with the other two kids. Just like how she was left alone in charge of things as a child.And then there’s this: They actually take the time to show us that Katara is sad and lonely and abandoned??What family does she have left at the South pole? None.And yet, people manage to think Katara is perfectly fine and happy.Katara, a person with severe abandonment issues spends her entire life being abandoned??What the fuck Bryke?Like, it’s pretty clear that they didn’t give two shits about Katara as a character; she was just supposed to be a pretty arm candy for the Hero™ with some handy dandy waterbending abilities.But if other people have done a spectacular job of turning this cardboard character into a fully fleshed out, multi dimensional character, why would you throw it away??Like, that’s just dumb.Why would they take an infinite number of steps back to turn Katara back into a cardboard character and fulfil romanticized misogynistic tropes?Much wow, many thanks.

Look I understand that Dick is like the oldest and the golden boy whatever whatever but I’m fully convinced that no matter what, Bruce is completely BLIND for Jason like B: *pointing at jason whose completely covered in blood* that’s my baby. And he’s never done anything wrong in his life, and he never will I think sure Bruce gets mad at Jason sometimes but it doesn’t last long because Jason’s funny and smart and when Bruce looks at him he sees his 15 year old son that he loves and lost and he can’t stay mad at that forever (even after he tried to kill Tim, but that doesn’t count) Bruce is an old sentimental man ok fuck off I bet he sits in Jason’s old room a lot And I think he’s really happy that he gets along with his brothers. Less happy that he gives Damian a gunI know 100% that Jason took Duke under his wing immediately to make him feel welcome and when Bruce saw that he was p r o u d, because Jason’s a good KID And Jason’s an awkward little shit so he shows his love by annoying the HELL out of Bruce. Jay: Look B I blew up a building to get your attentionBruce: …. you couldnt have… called? I feel like it’s just not talked about enough how much Jason’s death affected Bruce. Like I mean…. his son died…. like Bruce was robbed of his KID and of all the experiences he got with Dick and then when jason came back he was ya know… murdering people and Bruce was like 👁👄👁 Idk i hate hate hate when jason’s pinned as the “disappointment” because I really do think Bruce is extra proud of him, he literally rose from the fuckin dead And before Jason died their relationship was kinda wobbly, cause ya know Dick left (and on bad terms) but I really do think Bruce and Jay had a special bond There ya have it. The sad ramblings of a sleep deprived bitch. I’m also very very upset due to the passing of Chadwick Boseman so that’s why this is so emo

member from a rival teamwarnings: nonea/n: kjdjfkdjk ok so i had sudden inspiration and just spun this out real fast, i’m still working on requests though, don’t worry!sibling: kuroo tetsuroutetsurou finds out in the worst way possible, really  you shouldn’t be blamed though, because training camps are frustratingly busy, and stolen moments and touches are impossible to come by when you’re still trying to keep the relationship lowkeyin any case, you haven’t been able to touch your boyfriend at all this entire weekso naturally, when tetsu wanders into an empty classroom in the evening, wondering what that clattering sound was, the sight that greets him nearly makes him crack his water bottle with how hard he squeezes itbecause in the darkness, he sees karasuno’s captain sitting in the chair where the teacher usually sits, and you?you’re straddling daichi’s lap, leaving absolutely no room for jesus, and there’s some grinding going on there too, which is why tetsu will be buying some bleach for his eyes laterthe crafty bastard’s tongue is…down your throatthere are…hands…nasty, filthy sawamura hands all over your body, skimming up the side of your body—under your shirt—and then sliding down to…oh god, touch your asstetsurou’s dangerously calm about it, eyes narrowed with murderous intent“and just what is going on here?”a Conversation™ happens between kuroo and daichi where there is a lot of threatening on your brother’s part daichi listens, and responds pretty calmly, but you can tell by his not entirely straight face that he’s a little smug for having ruffled kuroo’s feathersthe rest of the team is supportive, they know daichi drinks his respect women juiceyou’re also still carrying out your duties as the team’s manager flawlessly, so they have no reason to complaindaichi’s an amazing boyfriend, and the fact that you’re from a rival team doesn’t phase him at allhe even comes to some of your brother’s games and sits on the nekoma sidehe says he’s only there to learn from nekoma’s play style, but you have your doubts because more often that not, you catch him looking at you during a gametetsu pulls you aside one day to tell you grudgingly, “you could do worse”you beam at him“…don’t tell sawamura i said that”naturally, you tell daichi he said thatsibling: oikawa tooruthe betrayallike the dramatic ass bitch he is, tooru just collapses against a bench in shock when he finds out, wailing for iwa-chan to do something about this agony(iwaizumi does something alright, by chucking a few volleyballs at his head)the rest of the team is a little concerned, because ushijima never shows much emotion so how good of a boyfriend could he be?turns out, a very good one, actuallyushijima’s a man of few words, but he doesn’t need to say much for you to see how much he likes youhe’s soft with you, giving you his full attention when he’s not playing, and this always surprises his teammates when you visit themtendou’s always one to tease you (”here to spy on us, y/n-chan?”) , but ushijima always shuts him down, even though you’ve told him repeatedly that you don’t mind, you think the redhead is funnytooru gets over it surprisingly quickly, but everything gets so much worse because the competition between the two of them just cranks up a thousand-fold“get your hands off my sister, ushiwaka” or “stop sucking my sister’s face. y/n, time to go” or “don’t get too ahead of yourself, ushijima. you’re temporary. she will always love me more”“when did i ever say that?”“so cruel, y/n-chan!”and you despair a little because even though ushijima doesn’t explicitly challenge your brother the way tooru does, ushijima is just as badhe does it with actions though, not words, like:being suspiciously more affectionate with you when tooru’s watchingslipping his large, shiratorizawa sports jacket onto your shoulders when you’re shivering, when tooru’s just about to do the sameteaching you volleyball (tooru blows a gasket when he finds out because that’s your sibling thing, and now another man has come along to steal that away…even though you still spend plenty of time with you brother, if not more, to soothe his battered ego)when aoba johsai plays a practice match against shiratorizawa for some ungodly reason, you suspect it has something to do with the two captains you truly do support your brother from the bottom of your heart, but he’s been insufferable latelyso when you pointedly call out, “nice serve, toshi!” or “nice kill, toshi!”iwaizumi has to stop and say, “y/n, please stop making trashykawa cry, it’s affecting his plays”tooru tries to chaperone you the entire time because shiratorizawa is a boarding school, with dorms and beds, and his precious sister will not be going anywhere near ushijima’stendou manages to distract him for long enough though, and you sneak awaywhen you giggle about this to ushijima as he hovers over you on his bunk bed, he just nips at your ear and shrugs slightly“he should have come to shiratorizawa”sibling: hinata shouyouthe most??? wholesome of relationshipshe’s a gentle gianthe’s aware of how strong and large he is, so he’s always so careful with youhe’s so sweet too, and always carries your things for you, even though you can absolutely handle itbecause you always go to date tech’s games by yourself to support him, it’s not uncommon for you to get hit on you always know when aone’s behind you though, because the cocky expressions on their faces melt into horrified oneshe’ll slip his hand into yours and glare at them while telling you, “i’m done. let’s go”you secretly love

it’s “taka-kun” or “nobu-chan,” his cheeks tinge pinkwhen you snuggle into his chest? big blush right therewhen you kiss him in front of his teammates? tomato red blushshouyou is so excited and

So now that my thoughts are more gatheredI loved season 2, the humor was pretty spot on other than the potty jokes, I am glad that the most of the characters were explored in a little more depth, the interactions, and of course there are things that I wished were different but….Buuut…Why did they basically give Vanya… all of Klaus’s powers…?….while giving him 0 powers…?Like I know he is no longer sober because of Dave which is a whole other story.But even the ending fight scene he gets caught by ghost when falling whilst drunk (sober?)….why didn’t they just give him his levitation powers like in the comics?I know he’s the “fuckup useless one”…but for real why even have a superhero character if he is just going to suddenly just conveniently not be in or disappear every fight scene and have no development torward strength or weakness? Why couldn’t he and Vanya have different types of telekinetic powers? They both could levitate….Why is he basically just a normal person? Vanya suddenly has full control of her powers, (memories or not I guess) and there is Klaus who seemingly fought against his training can’t develop his powers the near 2 decades he has been away from Reginald?He never asks for help from the ghosts, never sees any ghosts although that is his fear and power, never talks too them. His little trip to the after life still has not been explored. And the whole bringing back to life thing that Vanya has been a fanon Klaus power since he is the door of life and death it was kind of mind blowing that they gave it to someone else….like they might as well have given it too Diego or Luther I was so shocked.Like I really fell more in love with Vanya this season and I’m happy she is apparently over her family fucking her entire life over and they are over everything she did to them….but was there such a big power imbalance in the comics? And the fact that she was the one who got closure with Ben instead of Klaus was kind of like “a big woah” for me to take in. The brother who has been with him for so many years is suddenly gone and there is no shown moment of “oh Ben saved me using the powers you apparently gave him and now he is gone btw, but oh don’t panic”….And I’m happy Klaus seems to have relief Ben “Is in a better place”….I’m still kind of processing Bens “storyline”.The fact that Klaus was in the 60s for 3 years was never discussed…the fact that he somehow got hundreds(thousands?) of people to follow him is never discussed…and what he did and said to gain that “following” other than to do a parlor trick…The Dave plot line was just kind of heart breaking and it didn’t go anywhere… Like couldn’t he left him a letter or some shit? Like that whole situation felt like it was also just to further Dave’s plot line and from what I have heard Cody Ray Thompson kind of got uncomfortable with the sudden attention he received from fans so I really doubt he is ever going to be in the show ever again, which breaks my heart but I understand.I don’t know, I feel as if everyone was kind of baited into thinking Klaus was going to get a power upgrade and a storyline with everyone using his face for promotion… Instead he is just used to push Bens storyline further which I guess is fair since that was Bens past role?…I guess that I just assumed that he would play a bigger role since everyone was being so quite about what Klaus was up too in the 60 other than fight with Ben and be a cult leader…and hey I guess that’s all he did and no other development and that’s why there was no in depth discussion in interviews of Klaus. He was hardly in the show.Well I’m done with my hyperfixation ramble but tell me how y’all feel.I am trying not too be mean and I love all the characters! I’m just questioning some of the choices of the creators. I don’t want a big wave of sudden hate for the show cause that just hurts everyone involved. And hey it’s not my show.

anonymous asked:hi! i just wanted to ask your thoughts on how you believe a-yuan grew in cloud recesses? do you think lwj adopted him as a son openly? do you think they lived together in the jingshi or were they kept apart? there are so many different headcanons and i personally think lwj would keep lsz close but i wanted to know your thoughts/headcanons!!! (hidden dialogue ficlet: unlocked)When people see Lan Sizhui standing beside Lan Wangji, they often nod and remark in murmurs to one another, now there’s an exemplary disciple! as expected of Hanguang-jun. And it is true, of course it is true! that Lan Wangji raised this child, taught him how to position his hands above a guqin, taught him qin language, was there when A’Yuan attempted his first wobbly notes to question a lonely spirit trying to move on—Lan Wangji taught him how to hold a sword, the very root of elegant form and gracious conduct in battle. Lan Wangji brought him to the field of rabbits, and Lan Wangji combed his hair, and Lan Wangji showed him resilience, and Lan Wangji revealed to him how deeply sorrow can cut.  (There are other whispers too, ones less kind, but we will not dwell upon those.)But for those first three years, the ones that outsiders know nothing about, the ones that many even within Gusu forget or bury: the one beside A’Yuan was Zewu-jun.Though Lan Wangji had strength enough to drag his broken form to Yiling and bring back a fevered, half-dead child, he had not the strength to care for him, not the way a four-year-old needs. Lan Wangji, scars bleeding through the white of his robes like slashes of wild poppies, collapsed into his bed, unable to move for days on account of his agony.And so: what of the child?  Lan Xichen, harried, heartsore, exhausted on the heels of endless endings, carried A’Yuan to the medical building, sat by his little cot and listened to his labored breathing. He wrote letters on a cramped table meant to hold medical instruments and held his personal meetings in the hall of the sick and dying. Lan Xichen split his days and nights beside two beds, dark circles growing beneath his eyes, lines growing upon his brow. A’Yuan recovered quickly. Lan Wangji did not.And so: what of the child?Well. A child needs companionship, and a child needs attention, and a child needs warmth and love and education. Lan Xichen could not provide those, not nearly enough by half. He had raised his own brother once, see how that turned out! But what else could he do? A’Yuan could not join the other disciples, not yet. Lost and confused, he stared up at Lan Xichen with round eyes, mouth silent and solemn, grieving and yet not knowing how. It was a familiar expression. Lan Xichen thought of Wangji at six years old, those same eyes, that same mouth.What else could he do?For all that it is easy to see Lan Wangji’s hand in Lan Sizhui’s education—his sword forms, his musicianship, his elegance—it is easy to miss Zewu-jun’s: the way Sizhui values peace and guards it with careful diplomacy. The way Sizhui is quick to situate himself between two clashing men. The way Sizhui puts Hanguang-jun’s subtle and cold expressions to words. After all, no one but Zewu-jun could do that before.And on an unassuming night in the midst of Zewu-jun’s seclusion, when the moon is neither full nor crescent, Lan Sizhui clambers through the sect leader’s window with his closest, loudest friend, bringing a forbidden jar of wine and the kind and gentle smile he learned from the sad-eyed man who welcomes them in.(ko-fi)

A love letter to his.. ⟨Lucifer, Mammon, Leviathan and Satan⟩—Just fluff and smut for MC’s favourite physical traits of the brothers(Part 2 is here ♡)—Word count: 802—A/N: I may or may not add Solomon on the next part ( ꈍᴗꈍ) and also this is sfw and nsfw, I’ve thrown my dignity and morality to write smut, so enjoy~Lucifer–BackSFW➷Lucifer’s back had scars from what once his wings were attached to, now his back bear the regrets and burdens his brothers have ➷You’ve always admired the oldest brother for the mask he put on to disguise his emotions, but you’ve managed to break that façade everytime➷Back hugs are the best and you show him that, whenever he’s just walking down the hallways alone, you run up to him hugging him from the back, he stumbles a bit but regains his composure➷Would definitely tell you not to do that but he secretly likes it, so you ignore his warning and do it again anyways~❝Your back is so pretty Lucifer❞ ❝Even with the scars? ❞ ❝Even with the scars,❞➷Likes whenever you give him back massages even if you don’t know how, it’s the thought that counts and he appreciates your effort &lt;3NSFW➷Whenever he gets rough with you (which is very likely) you end up scratching his back, leaving red marks all over➷Though he would like to minimize the marks but, he couldn’t help but let it fuel his pride, he takes pride in knowing he made you feel good❝W-What are those red marks Lucifer?❞ ❝From MC❞ ❝WHAT?! FROM MY HUMAN?! ❞Mammon – HairSFW➷Playing with his fluffy snow white hair was your favorite past time➷Whether it be him laying his head down on your lap as he squabbles nonsense about his money scamming tactics or tying his hair up in different hair styles ➷Though he may be a little hesitant at first cause, he’s a lil tsundere❝H-Huh? You wanna play with my hair? Of course you do! B-But why?❞➷You may or may not find him asleep on your lap after a couple of minutes of your fingers gently playing with his hair and scalp➷He’s tired of his brother’s insults and just want you to be all soft and adorable for him okay? 🥺NSFW➷He likes getting his hair pulled as he eats you out, urging him to go down on you harder➷Lets out soft mewls when you do, tug on his white locks and he’ll surely lap you up❝H–Hah you’re that desperate for my tongue? Well I’ll show you how good I get with it ❞➷Yeah uh he can eat you on for hours, once he made you cum 2 times just with his tongue, he wanted to go at it more but you begged him to just fuck you➷And he did, praise him a lot too. That turns him onLeviathan – ThighsSFW➷Very comfy to sit on when he games, though he says it’s very distracting➷So when you tried wiggling while on his lap he would drop his controller and place both his hands on your hips, making you sit firmly ❝Why’re you acting like a brat?❞➷He also likes (awkwardly) petting your head when it’s on his thighs, makes a very good pillow~➷You playfully bit his thigh once and he let out a questionable noise, then proceeded to scold you while his face was completely red. NSFW➷If you tease him until he snaps he would most likely make you ride his thighs, stripping off your shorts as you placed yourself onto his firm thigh➷He lets you go on your own pace but he likes to grab you by the hips and help you a bit~❝Look at you humping my thigh like this, such a needy slut ❞➷And I’ll say that as your hips work, your mouth does as well, you’re making out with him as you ride his thigh~➷His dick is so hard, please help him~Satan – HandsSFW➷The way his hands are bigger than yours is very cute! He sometimes teases you by asking to measure your hands with his➷But we all know it’s just a tactic to make your hands touch~➷He warms your hands up whenever it’s cold, and would probably have one hand hold yours as the other flips the page on his book, and y'all stay like that for a while➷He always likes to tuck a piece of hair behind your ear, he’s sweet like that ^^❝Haha, your hand is so small compared to mine, don’t worry though I think it’s the perfect size for mine❞NSFW➷Fingering. ➷His index finger and middle finger pump in and out of your hole as his thumb rub your clit, and may I add that his fingers are pretty long so it can definitely reach far enough~➷Sometimes to shut you up he shoves two of his fingers into your mouth, ordering you to suck on them as he fucks you❝You think you can handle another finger kitten?❞➷Also hand holding when he fucks you, he thinks it’s just really intimate and romantic✧Lumi
