    Summary
      To Flamebringer, Executor is Angel, a beautiful escort given to him for a fun night. To Executor, Flamebringer is another thug playing boss in the wrong place. They should have only crossed path once before becoming a distant memory. It should be all there is to it.
Of course, it is never that simple.

    Summary
      “I need you to take me as your partner for the Yule Ball.”
There’s silence as Jungsoo tries to comprehend Heechul’s request. Surely he must have heard wrong. Heechul adds, “No, you didn’t hear wrong. I’m asking you to be my Yule Ball partner. I’ll even wear a dress and grow my hair.”
“You’ll wear a dress?” Jungsoo splutters with wide eyes.
Heechul sighs in exasperation. “That’s what you take from this conversation?”

  Summary
    "Random Word Daily Project" is a project I created to motivate me to write everyday. I use a random generator to give me a one word prompt everyday, and I make a drabble using my representation of said word.The works included in this series are varied in terms of fandom, pair, genres, ratings and contents. They're also posted on my Tumblr, heytherecastiel, under the #RWDP tag. If you like my stories, then you might want to check my blog, in case I have some gems you're looking for.I accept prompts for this series. Message me on Tumblr and I'd love to write it for you.

    Summary
      "To my first love, and my last, Dean Winchester. These are the things I want to tell you: the human body is 60% water. The number of neurons in one person is the rough equivalent of the number of stars in a small galaxy. There is 0.2 milligrams of gold in your blood. The heart is an elaborate engine. I love you."
