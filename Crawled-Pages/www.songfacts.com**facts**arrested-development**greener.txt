                                                  Songfacts®:This group-written track was produced by Arrested Development's leader Speech. The song takes on the issue of climate change from the perspective of the African American community. Speech told us: "We have always felt a connection with nature, we rhymed about the need to respect it and honor it on our first two albums. Fast forward to 2010 and the green movement has become such a large part of our culture, and yet not many rap about it. We decided to write another song about this topic. We also hope to get green movements to endorse the song and use it for their various campaigns." (Check out our full interview with Speech.)
