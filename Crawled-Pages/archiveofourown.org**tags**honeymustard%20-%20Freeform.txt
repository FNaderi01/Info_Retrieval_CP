    Summary
      Sans was just taking a relaxing walk. He never expected to meet Papyrus from a different dimension, when he'd gone astray from his usual path. This Papyrus looked scary, cruel, and ruthless. But Sans thought he was just a little misguided.  Can they help the other back to their timeline? And maybe even help with something else?...

    Summary
      This is a story about Sans the Skeleton. Well. A Sans the Skeleton. I’m sure you’re familiar with the punny brother in blue, but this is not that Sans.No, this Sans grew up in… a different kind of Underground. Food ran scarce and the dark, stale air drove many monsters to the brink of insanity. In this Underground, it was eat or be eaten, kill or be killed. And, as a 1HP monster, this Sans was royally screwed. That is, until he fell into another universe.  So, you know, your typical HoneyMustard sin.
