    Summary
      Through the spite of the spirits or plain rotten chance, a door that would have been better left untouched has opened. On the other hand, with Fire and Earth as one's allies, sometimes escaping is the easy part.   Even the Dragon-King's temple floods.

    Summary
      Daniel wanted to ease the wider world into the idea of What's Out There. Hammond wanted a way to teach soldiers to duck when the purple-tentacled cat-octopus-thing went for them. The NID... wanted something a little more ambitious.
When dealing with Kayaba... be careful what you ask for.

    Summary
      When SG-1 heads through the Stargate to explore some interesting looking ruins on a newly discovered seven chevron gate address, they end up finding way more than they expected. People claiming to know Earth, with strange looks and even stranger abilities? Of  course this couldn't have gone smoothly.
