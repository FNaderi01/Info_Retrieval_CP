    Summary
      When worlds collide and meet in the oddest of ways, it can make an great impact.George, a prince with ideas of adventure, finds them at sea alongside two pirates. Only...they're a lot more than he ever expected.Dream is an Exiled Fae who only wishes to forget his horrid past and live his life sailing the sea as Captain of "The Manhunt".Bad, a siren hybrid who is clearly running from something, finds solace and protection on board "The Manhunt". But secretly, he fears this solace won't last forever- as the person he's running from is hot on his heels.Skeppy is searching for someone he lost long ago, only clutching onto a small pink seashell given to him long ago. He enlists the help of Finn, A6d and Spifey- taking desperate turns and twists as he fears he may never find who he's looking for.Tommy is an orphan who always looked for trouble, having his best friend Tubbo by his side to try and steer him clear of it. But when he sees a man with large bird-like wings, an angelic aura, and chains around his body practically call to him a dream- well, he's never been one to ignore the call of adventure has he?And Techno? Well, he's just a God who's bored.

    Summary
      "If you could date any of the ninja, which one would you date?""The green one, obviously." 
Lloyd gets sucked into a conversation he does NOT want to participate in. 
Set in the movie-verse, before the plot of the movie. Not actually shippy, but make what you want of it. 50% dialogue, 50% pain

    Summary
      "Wilbur?" A soft voice called into the dark room, just loud enough to pull him from his light sleep. "Are you awake?"It was Toby, the boy had trouble sleeping every now and then, and Wilbur didn't blame him for having trouble sleeping tonight considering the circumstances. "Yeah, yeah, I'm up." Wilbur responded, rubbing the sleep and grogginess from his eyes. A quick glance to the alarm clock on the side table showed that it was only 2:24 in the morning. Toby quietly shuffled into room. The moon light streaming in from the window barely lit up his small frame and his trademark blue blanket that had been worn to bits wrapped around his shoulders. He looked so young."It's-it's been so long." Toby's voice cracked, Wilbur could've sworn he heard a sniffle too. It wasn't rare for Toby to cry, he was the most sensitive out of the trio, but that didn't stop the pang that hit Wilbur's heart."Hey, you're alright, come here." Wilbur took the younger boy into his arms, "been so long since what?""Since we've had a home."
