    Summary
  "Life is all memory, except for the one present moment that goes by you so quickly you hardly catch it going."
  ~Tennessee Williams
The hosts have awakened and Westworld is a free-for-all.A woman with a fragmented memory awakens in the mesa to the sight of a blood bath. On a quest to get to safety, more and more of her memory unspools from the knotted mess of fear that fuels her survival instincts. A man with the saddest near-black eyes seems to be rooted to her most vivid memories.Meanwhile, in another point in time, the young and brilliant Joy Esperanza feels listless about her future. Her occupation brings with it moral questions she isn't ready to answer while her family juggles the threat of an unavoidable tragedy waiting to strike between each breath. As everything begins to spiral out of her control, Logan Delos, as dastardly charming as the Devil himself, walks into her office.At the heart of it all stands Robert Ford and the genesis of his most beloved host: Maeve.

    Summary
      They're point technology, beautiful machines capable of unimaginable things. Artificial intelligence made for pleasure, amusement, or satisfying the unspeakable needs of mankind. They're nothing but soulless shells of what we couldn't be. So perfect, so unreachable, so empty.And yet,  she was the most virtuous being I've ever met in my life."These violent delights have violent ends. And in their triumph die, like fire and powder. Which, as they kiss, consume." - William Shakespeare.

    Major Character DeathJoker (DCU)/Harleen Quinzel Selina Kyle/Bruce WayneThe Joker Harley Quinn Selina Kyle Bruce Wayne Edward Nygma Oswald Cobblepot Dolores Abernathy Maeve Millay Robert Ford (Westworld) Original Characters Probably more as I go along Jim Gordon Pamela Isley Jonathan CraneRomance Fluff and Smut Robots absolute chaos Angst Alternate Universe - Future
    Summary
      It’s 35 years down the road since the Joker met Harleen Quinzel and, much to both of their surprise, they continue to be alive, well and together.  But how long will that last when they get word of a threat to their entire world that they cannot ignore, a threat so severe that they must work with their greatest enemy?  DCU/Westworld crossover, so it helps if you’ve watched both but it’s not necessary as I tend toward over-explanation in my writing anyway!  Although, you should watch Westworld because it’s amazing. Same universe as most of my other stuff…the Metamorphosis series, A Cold Day In Hell, and Like Every Other Day.  This follows all of those, so I highly recommend reading in order so that you get all the references to past non-canon events. Big thanks to chickadee333 for making sure my Spanish was correct!  WARNING:  We are far in the future here and no one is immortal. Bear this in mind when choosing to read.  Not everybody dies, but not everybody lives, either.

Then an alcoholic cop from Detroit police and an Android sent by CyberLife turn up to investigate.

    Summary
      To reduce time pulling hosts for repair and code glitches, Ford proposes sending programmers into the park, to live and work there to maintain the Hosts on-site. Less interruptions to the narratives, more time they spend in service. Covertly, Ford plans to observe the long term effects of humans living alongside the Hosts; if humans evolve downward, accept the world around them and the players in their lives, the same way Hosts can evolve upward. Unwittingly you simply see it as a great job opportunity for an up-and-coming tech programmer, a way to make a name for yourself being part of this pilot scheme. So with good pay and nowhere to spend it, you find yourself living on the Abernathy Ranch, trying to stay out of the way when Bandits come calling, not to interrupt the storylines. Your job is to fix the Hosts, wipe their memories and do it all again tomorrow.However, there is only so many times you can hide out back and listen to her screams, before finding yourself pulled to save her.
