    Summary
      Jango hadn’t been sure what to expect from being dead. He’d grown up with stories of Manda, the warriors marching far away, looking over them as they plodded through their lives.But, frankly, he hadn’t expected that to be true.---This was a lesson. And a test.Remember the lesson.“I will,” Jango said softly, reaching out to trace a finger over the symbol of the Haat Mando’ade, still painted proudly on his armor. “I’ll remember.”---My take on the time travel trope with Jango Fett as the time traveler, after he's forced to watch the aftermath of all his bad decision making in the afterlife. It's gonna be one hell of a ride.Eventual Jango Fett/Obi-Wan Kenobi relationship. WIP - Will update sporadically.

    Summary
      An irritated Pokemon might tell you to stop what you're doing. An irritated animal will probably just attack you. Pokemon, for all their power, would be open books and a breeze to care for to any competent animal handler on Earth. After a fiery death, a professional zookeeper who never outgrew Pokemon games ends up in the world of Pokemon. The entire world is thrown onto it's side.

    Summary
      When a Voldemort in his thirties encounters a time-travelling, seventeen-year-old Harry Potter, he makes a dangerous—and hilarious—assumption. He assumes that Harry is his son. And his son, of course, deserves the very best.A confused Harry plays along for the sake of self-preservation, but living with his “father” is proving to be intolerable in more ways than one.
  “You are mine,” Voldemort said gently, and smiled when Harry flinched. So the boy did know Voldemort, after all. He knew Voldemort was to be feared. “I will look after you, my own.”
  “I don’t belong to you,” Harry spat, despite his fear. Oh, what a delight he was! He was no cowering, simpering sycophant, like Voldemort’s other followers; no, this child had a spine of steel. Not many could stand before Voldemort without quailing.
  “You are my son,” Voldemort declared. “Of course you belong to me. Your every cell, your every fibre, your every heartbeat. You are mine in flesh and blood and soul. You are mine in magic. And you will not deny me.”
Now with Chinese and Portugese translations, and featuring art by Mona and Hypnodisc!

      Viktor Krum see’s how much Harry is struggling after the destruction of Voldemort and the death of Cedric Diggory at the end of the Triwizard Tournament, but no one else seems to notice. Determined to help, Viktor invites Harry to live with him and his parents and attend Durmstrang Institute. Will be slash eventually though not of the Viktor/Harry persuasion.

      Klaus's powers may be a bit more extensive than just seeing the dead, he's not sure what to do about that.ORThe one where Klaus's power is not ghosts, but souls and that makes a hell of a difference.
