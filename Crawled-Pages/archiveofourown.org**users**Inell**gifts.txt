    Summary
      a direct follow up to 'I'm sure I used to be (so free)', picking up after Stiles decided to leave.*** "He can’t go back.  He can’t be Stiles Stilinski anymore.  There’s blood on his hands and a war in his heart, and he can’t go back to that life, no matter how much he misses the people he cares about with a harsh, aching ferocity.  So he keeps moving instead, with no real destination in sight.  He’ll keep trying to outrun everything that happened, everything he did, until he can’t run anymore."***Not as dark or angst-filled as the tags imply, but please check the warnings at the beginning of each chapter.

    Summary
      "It won’t be easy.  It’ll be dark and painful and it’ll require doing things that Stiles would never normally consider.  It might mean sacrificing innocent people and being hated for a while.  But that’s what saving the world really means.  The path to Hell is paved with good intentions, sure, but the one to Heaven is paved with bloody, vicious glory.  
He knows now what it means to be a hero.  It means doing things that may not feel right, things that the world might struggle to forgive, even if those actions are to save them all.  It means emptying himself out, carving out everything he used to be to make room for something darker, something stronger."

    Summary
      sequel to 'we can be heroes', third story in the 'we can be heroes' verse.
***
Steve, Bucky, Thor and Hulk have their supernatural strength, speed and healing abilities, not to mention Thor has Mjolnir, and Bucky has his arm.  Clint has his bow and arrows and Natasha has her incredible combat skills.  Tony has his suit of armor, sure, and he’s definitely not vulnerable outside of it, either, but out of all of them, he gets it most: Stiles is just a human, and he needs all of the advantages he can get if he ever has to go up against superpowered people.
***
Between his relationship with Steve, working for SHIELD, and growing closer to the rest of the Avengers, Stiles feels that things are finally going well.  But there's a new threat targeting superheroes, his friendship with Scott is changing, and it's hard to trust the people you work with when they happen to all be spies.

      Allison and Natasha's hook up after Stiles's birthday party in 'we can be heroes', from Allison's POV.
"Silently, she reaches for the hem of her shirt, tugging it over her head.  She tosses it aside and doesn’t watch as it crumples on the carpet, instead holding Natasha’s gaze.  Standing in her skirt and her bra, she tips her chin slightly in challenge."
