Multiple refiners have corrosion control documents (CCDs) in a written document or spreadsheet format. These media can be lengthy, tedious and have limited access. This reduces the ease of access of the document to deliver its information to the intended recipients, plant personnel involved in operations, reliability and maintenance. By creating a web based, visual, interactive viewer that can access all the information in a CCD, it reduces the activation energy required for the intended audience to receive the information. Our E-CCD is a web-based platform that can be accessed by desktop or tablet, that highlights process flow diagrams for a given unit by corrosion loop, corrosion rate, and metallurgy. In addition, meta data is then assigned to each equipment item that can be accessed through a simple right click on that item. Corrosion loop information is also provided in a column on the left side of the view screen. The following data can be assigned to a specific equipment item.
