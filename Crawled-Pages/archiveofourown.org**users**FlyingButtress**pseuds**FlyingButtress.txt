    Summary
      Stumbling into a cult ritual leads Sam and Dean on a new adventure in some old, familiar places, like their childhood home and their mother's arms. The only downside is they're also in their old bodies, and with danger looming around every corner, to boot.
With help from the angels, Dean has to find and stop the man responsible for putting Dean back in his 4-year-old body, balancing childhood with his very adult responsibilities. Somewhere along the way, he lost all dignity, but at least he's not stuck in a baby carrier like Sam. And since they're already here, they might as well fix some other events.
