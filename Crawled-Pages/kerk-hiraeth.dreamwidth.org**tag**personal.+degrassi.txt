Thought I'd share this check-in ideaMar. 16th, 2020 11:52 am
    https://alexcat.dreamwidth.org/1212672.html   Been a deep funk for long time now; deeper lately to the point that I sometimes find it impossible to force myself outside to even top up my gas metre; or worse, make sure that the bird feeders are filled.   It doesn't help that I have had a dry cough since before I can even remember; not back to childhood kind of thing, but certainly before I moved up to Scotland. This means I am ultra conscious of every cough; even though I spend most of my time totally alone. I know I have begun to become uncaring whether I'm talking my thoughts or ideas aloud and that is not helping me go outside.  Point being I have no bug, and for the first time in a long while I find myself not placing pressure on myself to go outside.  Anyways.  I'm here; keeping an ear out for people who are posting and such; even if I'm not responding terribly much.  I know I live too much in my head; was a problem even when I used to go to the SF club in Plymouth &amp; to Trek Cons etc; thinking this year I'll not have much choice about going to Prides in NI.  Going to have to go out soon, but there's no moral imperative stopping me panic buying as I quite literally do not have money to buy even what I should actually need to get through until my medical pension in slightly over two weeks.  I'm not struggling as I'm sure a lot of people are because my mental health has often placed me in the position of getting by on not enough for so long now that I'm often nor conscious of it.  So if you feel like talking, or sharing or whatever here, or via the post I've linked to, may be a way of letting people know that you're ok and remembering that even if we don't interact very often, we still have each other's backs.  Binge watching an awful lot of Degrassi episodes; which has a soap-opera-y way pf showing you that people can be jerks &amp; friends to each other and still stay together.  Don't be an idiot and panic buy. Don't be a Boris or a Donald. Behave responsibly and everything will, eventually, be fine.   Goddess watch over you all,  kerk
