		books.
		televsion.
		films.
		music.
		Currently reading Size 14 is Not Fat Either (Heather Wells series, #2) by Meg Cabot. Last read The Iron Daughter (The Iron Fey, #2) by Julie Kagawa. My to-read list is constantly growing. I love reading YA and fantasy books.
		Currently watching Supernatural and Star Trek: The Next Generation (for the first time). Need to catch up on Merlin, Psych, How I Met Your Mother, Misfits, and many more. Too many good TV series exist.
		Most recent movies watched include Iron Man (1, 2, &amp; 3 in one week), Epic, and Star Trek Into Darkness. I have too many favorite films. Some of the best date nights include seeing a film in theater or even at home.
		My current playlist includes "Tennis Court" by Lorde, "Still Into You" by Paramore, and "Angels In Everything" by Blue October. I love almost all types of music. I'm on a never ending quest for new music.
