Yesterday I posted a meme, and today I am beginning to tackle the answers! In the interest of not spreading the answers over too many posts, I’m sticking these two questions together.landofnowhere asked: 20. If you could ‘unkill’ any character from any story, who would it be?Sirius Black. After I finished the fifth Harry Potter book, I basically went into mourning and walked around for the next week with my own personal raincloud over my head. It just strikes me as so incredibly sad - not just that he died - but that he spends years in prison, and then he breaks out and he’s on the run and he’s forced to take shelter in his family’s old house (which he hates) and he’s not even exonerated before he falls through that stupid veil. No chance at happiness or freedom. Just misery and imprisonment and a few miserable years in hiding and then pow, that’s it, a completely unheroic death. There are other characters whose deaths I would undo if I could (...still hoping the MCU will see the light about Natasha, frankly), but the combination of miserable life followed by death with no chance for happiness in between is mercifully rare. redrikki asked: 15. What kind of character do you wish you saw portrayed more often?Cranky girls. Not justifiably enraged revolutionary types (not that I have anything against the justifiably enraged revolutionaries - viva Katniss! - but I feel that they’re easier to find) but girls who have a low-grade fire of omnidirectional crankiness always burning in their souls for no particular reason, and it makes them sarcastic and short with people. Like Jaye from Wonderfalls or Joni from Saints Rest. (Catra is the OTT version of this who is not so much “cranky” as “constantly enraged.”)
