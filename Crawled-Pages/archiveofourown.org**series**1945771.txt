    Summary
      “I want you,” he hisses, “to pick who dies.”
Hotch doesn’t allow himself to react, he only stares right back at the man. Rossi can hear his teeth grinding together from three feet away.
“No.”
The man narrows his eyes, schooling his expressions just as Hotch had.
“Then you all die,” he says plainly. “That’s my compromise. One of your choosing or all of them.”

    Summary
      “So, I have a delusion assassin killing anyone who takes up my attention or detriments my status as an academic.” Spencer groans into his hands, murmuring to himself. “Probably started as an admirer, began to display erotomanic stalking habits, which has a heavy psychopathology of evolution.” He hums to himself unhappily, muttering “oh God,” before looking up to both Gideon and Hotch. “There’s only two outcomes…”

    Graphic Depictions Of ViolenceAaron Hotchner &amp; Spencer ReidAaron Hotchner Spencer Reid Chester Hardwick The BAU TeamAngst Whump Fights Threats of Violence Death Threats Trapped Protective Aaron Hotchner Head Injury
    Summary
      “There won’t be anyone to open that door for at least… thirteen minutes.”
The grin comes back, contrasting to Hotch’s heavy-set scowl. He lifts a hand protectively when Chester steps closer to Spencer, plucking a photo from the box of evidence. “Took me less than five to do this.”
The image is of a woman, late twenties, short brown hair, shoulder length. She’s been massacred, torn apart by nails and teeth and bare fists. Everything Hardwick needs, he has, bodily force and brute strength. Enough willingness to get dirty, to tear someone to pieces.
