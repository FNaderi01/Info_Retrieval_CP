Londonderry is a town in western Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. The town sits between Manchester and Derry, the largest and fourth-largest communities in the state. The population was 24,129 at the 2010 census[1] and an estimated 26,126 in 2017.[2] Londonderry is known for its apple orchards[3] and is home to the headquarters of Stonyfield Farm and part of Manchester-Boston Regional Airport.
The more densely settled portion of town, where 11,037 people lived at the 2010 census,[4] is defined as the Londonderry census-designated place (CDP) and roughly occupies the southeastern and southern parts of town, around New Hampshire Route 102.

History[edit]

Londonderry lies in an area that was first known as Nutfield because of the dense woods with nut trees. A petition for the town was submitted to the General Court of the Province of New Hampshire on September 23, 1719.[5] That petition stated that the petitioners had settled “at Nutfield about the Eleventh of Aprile last” – i.e. April 11, 1719. That petition requested “ten miles square” and stated that there were now about seventy families and inhabitants from both Ireland and New England. Many of the Scots-Irish settlers had left their homes in Londonderry in the Province of Ulster in the north of Ireland, and arrived in Boston in 1718 to start a new life without religious wars and persecution. On June 21, 1722, the town was chartered and given the name "Londonderry".[6][7][8] The grant made by Samuel Shute, Governor of the Province of New Hampshire, was for a tract of land described as follows:
"Beginning on the North East Angle at a Beach Tree marked which is the south East angle of Chester and Running from thence due South on Kingstown Line four miles and an half and from thence on a West Line one mile and three Quarters and from thence South six miles and an half and from thence West north West nine miles and an half, and from thence North Eleven miles and an half from thence north north East Three miles from thence East South East one mile and from thence South South West to the South West Angle of Chester and from thence on an East Line Bounding on Chester Ten miles unto the Beach Tree first mentioned.”
The town was divided into two parishes on February 25, 1739/40. Windham was set off and incorporated on February 12, 1741/42. The northwest portion, with other land, was incorporated as Derryfield, now Manchester, on September 3, 1751. Derry was incorporated on July 2, 1827. Border adjustments and annexations were made throughout this period continuing until June 27, 1857, when the line with Hudson (formerly known as Nottingham West) was established.
Approval of the petition submitted to the Province of New Hampshire required the petitioners to obtain an agreement from Col. John Wheelwright for the sale of the land. He held claim to it based on a grant to his grandfather. That agreement was obtained on October 12, 1719, and included a statement of the bounds, extending west as far as the Merrimack River.[9] This conflicted with a grant for the town of Dunstable, now Nashua, made by the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1673.[10] The provincial line between Massachusetts and New Hampshire was not settled in its present location until 1741. Thus when Londonderry was granted, the westernmost portion actually lay within the Dunstable grant and the Province of Massachusetts Bay. The resulting land conflicts with "Dunstable encroachers" were still being dealt with by the town in 1783 and 1791.[11] Private owners were resolving these conflicts between each other as late as 1812.[12]
The Manchester and Lawrence Railroad was opened in November 1849,[13] with depots at North Londonderry, Wilson's Crossing, Derry and Windham. Two months later, on January 26, 1850, Dearborn Whittier, a prominent resident, was hit and killed by a railroad car at Wilson's Crossing.[14] On March 12 the town voted to require gates at all crossings, although the issue persisted for a few more years.[15]
The Manchester and Derry Street Railroad, sometimes referred to as the Derry and Manchester Street Railroad or trolley car, opened in December 1907 and operated between Broadway in Derry and Elm Street in Manchester until August 1926.[16]
In 1719, the first American potato was grown in Derry, then a part of Londonderry.[17]
The first U.S. census, conducted in 1790, reported the town's population to be 2,622.

Geography[edit]
Londonderry is the westernmost municipality in Rockingham County. It is bordered by the towns of Auburn to the northeast, Derry to the east, and Windham to the southeast, all in Rockingham County, and by Hudson to the south, Litchfield to the west, and Manchester to the north, in Hillsborough County. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 42.1 square miles (109.1 km2), of which 42.0 square miles (108.7 km2) is land and 0.1 square miles (0.3 km2) is water, comprising 0.31% of the town.[1]
The town of Londonderry is drained on the east and south by Beaver Brook and on the west by Little Cohas Brook, Watts Brook, Colby Brook and Nesenkeag Brook, all of which flow to the Merrimack River. The town's highest point is 535 feet (163 m) above sea level, on Number Eight Hill (named after the old school house that used to be on it) north of the center of town.
The town is crossed by Interstate 93, New Hampshire Route 102, New Hampshire Route 128, and New Hampshire Route 28. Half of Manchester–Boston Regional Airport, including the main terminal, is in the northwest corner of the town.
Though Londonderry has grown to become one of the larger towns, by population, in the state, it lacks any concentrated downtown area, central business district, or town center.  Historically, no village had developed in Londonderry, as it was largely a rural farming area. Population growth in the town only began in the 1970s, when the construction of I-93 turned Londonderry into a bedroom community and exurb for the Greater Boston area.  The major retail district lies in the town's southeastern corner near where NH 102 interchanges with I-93, with smaller commercial districts lying at the intersection of NH 128 and NH 102, and near where NH 28 and NH 128 merge.  The Town Hall and schools are built near the geographic center of the town along an otherwise rural stretch of NH 128.

Economy[edit]
Londonderry is home to numerous businesses, many of which are located in the northern part of the town near Manchester-Boston Regional Airport (MHT), or in the southeastern part of town near I-93, on NH 102. Major businesses headquartered in town include Stonyfield Farm and Blue Seal Feeds; a bottling facility of the Coca-Cola Bottling Co. is also located in town. The town is also home to numerous chain retailers.
Mack's Apples, Sunnycrest Farm, and Elwood Orchards are among the several orchards in town and are emblematic of the town's important farming heritage. The abundance of apple orchards in town has made apple picking a popular fall activity among all residents.
One former apple orchard is currently being transformed into a 600-acre commercial and residential development to be known as Woodmont Commons.[3]
Transportation[edit]
Londonderry is crossed by three New Hampshire state highways and one Interstate Highway.
NH 28 crosses North Londonderry, entering the town from Derry in the east and leaving the town into Manchester in the north. NH 28 is known locally as Rockingham Road when it enters from Derry, and merges with Mammoth Road at the northern terminus of NH 128.
NH 102 crosses South Londonderry, entering the town from Hudson in the southwest corner, and leaving the town into Derry in the east. NH 102 is known locally as Nashua Road.
NH 128 is the main north-south route through Londonderry, entering from Windham in the south and terminating at NH 28 in North Londonderry. It is known locally as Mammoth Road.
Interstate 93 crosses the eastern side of Londonderry from south to north. There are two exits to access Londonderry: Exit 4 (NH 102) and Exit 5 (NH 28).
Londonderry is partially home to the Manchester–Boston Regional Airport which it shares with the city of Manchester. There is no passenger rail service in Londonderry.
