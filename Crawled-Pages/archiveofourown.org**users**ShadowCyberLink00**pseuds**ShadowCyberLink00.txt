    Summary
      Private Investigator Miles Edgeworth has just arrived in the infamous town known as Kurain Village. While there he tries to investigate the legend that Vampires roam the streets of this small town. While investigating he meets a kind hearted young man named Phoenix Wright who seems to have no free will of his own, not if his fiancé has anything to say about it. Edgeworth has to figure out what’s haunting this town and if he can stop it and protect the innocent people of this town, but as he keeps digging more on this mystery, the more he worries he’s putting Phoenix in danger. Will he be able to find the truth? And why does it seem as though some of it has to do with Phoenix?It’s a Vampire AU! I was originally going to just make this a one shot for my series but the idea kept growing so much that I just had to make it a story instead!

    Summary
      To say that Phantom Thief Moonshadow, the infamous vigilante who had been committing thefts in the name of justice for years in Japanifornia, was only a bit of a celebrity was a gross understatement. For people like Phoenix Wright, who had lived in the East until he was 18 and moved to Japanifornia to attend Ivy College, the thief's existence would have been unknown until they watched the local news. So, even though Phoenix was horribly late to the Moonshadow party, it hadn’t taken long after that initial introduction through a magazine when he was 18 for him to succumb to Moonshadow fever as well.
