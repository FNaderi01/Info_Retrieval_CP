    Summary
      Stiles Stilinski is tired.  Tired of being ignored and forgotten once the research is done.  After defeating Gerard and freeing Jackson from the Kanima he thought things would improve but somehow it got worse.  Derek is focused on building his pack which includes the newly rescued Erica and Boyd, freed after Allison realized her grandfather was nutso, and the freed Jackson who narrowly avoided being shipped overseas by his parents.  Scott is focused on his neverending relationship drama with Allison and his new best bud Isaac.  Left alone more often than not, Stiles feels everyone is moving on without him so he looks for his own path.When Deaton is unable to help him with his Spark he looks elsewhere and finds others who help him along until he finds himself meditating in his room and is surprised by an Astral form that shows up.  Unknowing attracting the attention of the new Sorcerer Supreme, Stiles discovers that he might be able to not only help Dr. Strange, but he just might find out how he can protect both his home and those jerks in what he considers his pack - whether Mr. Hale or Mr. McCall consider him or not.

    Summary
      Nearly two years after being possessed by the Nogitsune, Stiles is still trying to get a handle on things. Away at college, he feels more stable; more settled. But at home in Beacon Hills for summer break after his Freshman year at UC Berkeley, he is once again plagued by nightmares.The thing is, Void left behind a thousand years worth of information in Stiles' head. Information that Stiles is slowly realizing can help undo some of the damage that was done to Beacon Hills.Between bodies once again turning up in Beacon Hills and an increasingly close relationship with Derek Hale, Stiles has a lot on his plate. Factor in a talking tree, a sacred duty to the land, and some dead/not-dead drama, and Stiles is about to have one Hale of a summer.
