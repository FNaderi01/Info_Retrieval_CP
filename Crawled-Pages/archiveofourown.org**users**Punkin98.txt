    Summary
      She was returning for a mission and she was tired, not to mention chakra exhaustion was trying to invade her body, and with the little chakra she had left she was covering her pheromones as not to attract anyone else.She had fought for what seemed like hours with those rogue-nin outside the borders, and she was impatiently waiting for the gates to show themselves when she smelled 6 obnoxious scents. She smelled them before they had actually spotted her, or so it seemed.All of them were Alphas, judging by how their smell was filling her nostrils and a certain instinct in her was awaking. It didn't happen with Betas. Every one of them was an Alpha. She was SO fucked.

    Summary
      When Sakura gets a phone call from her, now former, room mate and tells her she has three months to officially move out she is livid. Lucky for her that she gets a head start in the seemingly right direction when a close friend and coworker gives her a list that could hopefully hold her future room mate. Unlucky for her that it's among five men she hardly knows.// hiatus

    Summary
      Injured shinobi Nakamura Shiro hated the library: there was nothing to do, no-one to talk to and, most importantly, nothing that could get his blood pumping. Yet, the reoccurring presence of a young, pink-haired girl with a curious choice of books piqued his interest and he thought he might just go over there and make her an offer neither of them would forget.

    Summary
      Sakura looks at the boy in front of her, bold and loud and unashamed, looked at his weirdly cut hair and bushy eyebrows, and goes on a date with him. 
or, sakura's rejection of lee in canon doesn't make sense because she was literally bullied for her looks and the author is mad.

  Summary
    (REWORKED)Sakura has the worst luck. Or the best. It could be seen either way. All she knows is she keeps running across smoking hot men and having smoking hot sex and she's quite okay with that. Although, it does bring troubles with it. If she had known how much trouble fantastic sex would be she would have...well maybe she would have done everything the same. Love hotels, cage fights, undercover missions, and dark secrets are some of the least of it.
