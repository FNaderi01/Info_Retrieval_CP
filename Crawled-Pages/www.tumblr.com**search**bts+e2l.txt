Everyone knew his name, he was the type of guy people parted in the hallways for, the type of guy girls chased after, the type that guys would be jealous of. Jeon Jungkook knew he was a heartthrob, he had everyone wrapped around his little finger and he knew it. It was your second year in college, Jungkook was at his peak popularity and you were, well, decidedly not. The halls were crowded, glances were exchanged and all seemed well until he came. The chatter died down into whispers and the crowd of teenagers parted, a usual hallway had become a runway for the college heartthrob and everyone watched as he made his way through. His long, wavy hair was hardly kept out of his face by a pair of overpriced sunglasses placed atop his head as he paraded the hall. He sent multiple winks in various directions as he passed, and just as quickly as he had appeared, he was gone. This wasn’t the first time you had witnessed the effects of the boy, it sometimes felt like you could never get away from him, you’d hear of him through hushed whispers and lovesick giggles. You were surprised the freshmen girls hadn’t made a shrine of him yet. You had tried to ignore him, but it had proved too difficult, so instead you feigned ignorance and tried not to look too interested. Keep reading

            Get You The Moon (M)        Pairing | Taehyung x ReaderGenre | Fluff, smut, angst / College!AU, enemies to lovers!AU, football!AU,  jock!Taehyung x student reporter!OC Warnings | Explicit language, sarcastic banter, dirty talk, blowjob, facefucking, eating out, cumplay, cum-dumpster, fingering, rough sex, slight dom!tae, spanking, degradation, unprotected sex, ass-pining, tae has the phattest ass and dick but wbkSummary | Life has its ways of fucking with you, but you know you’ve hit 50 feet below rock bottom after being tasked to do a profile feature on Kim Taehyung, the varsity football captain, for your school newspaper. Pure torment awaits you, but this is alongside glassy eyes, pink cheeks and conflicted feelings that you’ve never dared to imagine with the likes of the devil incarnate.Word count | 19.6k “What a surprise, you’re alive.”It is exactly that fake enthusiasm and subtle mirthful nuance that’s too familiar to your liking that gives rise to the arch of your eyebrow. You don’t even need to look up at the owner of the voice to picture the shit-eating smirk that belongs to none other than your editor-in-chief-slash-best-friend, Min Yoongi. Such morbid greetings have been long established as an inside joke between the two of you due to the peculiar sense of humour that you two share. This is just how he likes to start his mornings. Being the systematic person he is, he has his own morning routine in the newsroom. Regardless of the pile of work on his desk, he’ll first make a beeline for his first cup of coffee of the day, after which he will come sauntering your way to provoke you with his laundry list of snarky remarks – about work, being tired, being alive and dead, about how bureaucracy sucks, the negative sides of capitalism and what not. Well, you two share a deep-seated sense of misanthropy so albeit provocative, his laments are refreshing in the morning – a literal morning boost of positivity from negativity. “Not for long buddy,” you shrug, looking up from your laptop and your eyes land on Yoongi, who looks just as dead. “I barely slept last night – was busy rushing my essays. Essays, might I repeat. So it would be great if you don’t have much for me today, although I know you have a kink for torturing me.”At this, the edges of his lips curl up and you instantly register the meaning behind the sinister smile: your impending doom. “I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I do have something for my most talented and gung-ho reporter and best friend.”“Kindly elaborate,” you smile back acrimoniously, squinting your eyes in distrust. “It involves a profile feature of a popular varsity athlete.”An involuntary groan escapes your lips almost instantly. Athletes are the worst people to interview. “That’s not even the worst part yet. As we’re celebrating the 50th anniversary of our publication this year, we’ll be doing a special spread on honorary members of the school, including club presidents, captains and valedictorians. Oh, which reminds me – maybe I should feature myself for being the most overworked Editor-In-Chief because this publication is sucking my entire soul, but anyway, I digress.” He brings up his mug to his lips. It’s only 10am, but you wonder how many cups he has had, eyeing the pallor of his face. “I’ve already assigned the other reporters their respective targets for the lack of a better word, and left the toughest nut for you to crack,” he grins smugly and that’s when it hits you. Clocking you square in the face. “Yoongi, no you didn—”“Yoongi, yes,” his smirk widens at your aghast expression, “A profile feature on Kim Taehyung, for my most talented and hardworking reporter.”Kim Taehyung. Your biggest nemesis. The boy who lives to torment you.   Keep reading

You glance up from the parchment you’ve been staring at for the past few hours, the bottle of ink you’ve set on the coffee table in front of you almost empty. It’s late – the usually somewhat lighter lake water outside the window of your common room has gone pitch black, with only the occasional merman swimming past to give you a bit of a scare. Most of your housemates have retreated into the dormitories, with only a few of them still hanging around, their soft chatter echoing through the room. Even though the sound of water swishing outside usually helps you relax, it’s not working tonight – you’re cold and you’re tired, your aching body practically begging for you to get some rest.You let out another sigh as you hear the entrance open and someone walks in. You keep your eyes fixed on the book in your lap, the different formulas you’re supposed to be studying starting to swim around on the pages. Why did you choose to take Alchemy again? Why did you decide to give yourself a headache various times throughout the week to take this subject?“You look like shit,” sounds a voice, the words echoing off the stone walls. Your headache worsens when you recognise it and you suppress the urge to groan loudly and bury your face in your hands. Keep reading

            Stranded | JJK | Teaser        To be posted on September 1st 5:45am KST.Jungkook’s offer to help you study for your exam is unwelcome. His entire presence is unwelcome. You don’t want help from the guy who passes all his classes without even trying. It’s annoying — he is annoying. From the way he grins whenever he catches you staring at him, to the way his eyes shine whenever he smiles at you. Oh, and let’s not forget the way his tattoos shift when he stretches or the way his jawline sharpens when he’s focused. Nope, you definitely can’t stand him.›› AU: Enemies to lovers, fuck/badboy!Jungkook›› Genre: Fluff / Smut / Angst›› Rating: NC-17 (explicit sexual content, 18+)›› Pairing: JJK x Reader›› Word Count: 13k›› Jungkook Snuggle Drabbles.Warnings Include:A lot of swearing, emotional and romantic angst, sexual content, the desecration of a mug.The complete list will be on the fic!A/N: Let me know if you guys are excited!!!! &lt;3Your peace doesn’t last long. Not even halfway through your first coffee, your doorbell rings. Groaning, you get up and prepare your best ‘no I don’t want to buy whatever you’re selling’ face. Upon unlocking the door, that face falters. “What the hell are you doing here?” you spit out the moment you see Jungkook’s big doe eyes. He’s standing on your doorstep like he’s supposed to be here. With his backpack nonchalantly slung over one shoulder.He looks past you, into your apartment. “Oh, you started studying for psych?” Your living room is a mess. “Well, I was trying to start, but I’ve been rudely interrupted by someone who has no invitation to be here.” He rolls his eyes. “I’m here to make sure that you don’t fail another class and have to drop out.”  Like he owns the place, he pushes past you and waltzes inside. He drops his backpack and readjusts his baseball cap, showing off his forehead and chocolate brown hair. It’s really starting to get long.“I don’t need your help.” There’s no way he’s here just to help you study. And even if he was, he’s just going to distract you. You’re not friends. He must have some ulterior motive for being here. Jeon Jungkook doesn’t study, let alone help people study. Not to your knowledge at least. “I can manage just fine on my own.” He grabs his laptop from his bag. “What part of ‘having to drop out if you fail another class’ did you not understand?” He puts the device down and gets comfortable on your couch. As if he’s done it before. You cross your arms over your chest. “Who told you about that?” He shrugs. “Jimin mentioned it, he must have it from Taehyung. Does it really matter?” “Yes, it matters,” you sneer. “I didn’t ask you to be here. I don’t want you to be here. There’s no way I’m going to get anything done with you around. Get the fuck out.” You point a finger at the door, waiting for him to leave. “Do you not hear me?” “Oh, I heard you. I’m just waiting for you to get over yourself and realise that you actually need my help.” Tag List Instructions:Comment that you want to be tagged when it’s posted.I have 25 spots open for the taglist, if you send me an ask or dm, I won’t be adding you.

As a journalist, you’re constantly fighting for the best stories, wanting ever so desperately for that one piece to start churning out those inspirational juices until they’re overflowing. Longing for that feeling where your fingers start to cramp from typing too much but you just can’t stop.You couldn’t get dressed fast enough.You have no clue what stories will be on the table to be assigned, but you have heard whispers in the hallways at work the past few days that one of those stories involves the president of the United States. You shiver with glee just thinking about it.After gathering all of your papers and shoving them into your briefcase, you grab your car keys and practically skip out of your house, but you manage to swallow the urge away. You must maintain your professional appearance. Skipping just won’t cut it.The reason you’re in such a good mood for today (despite it being big assignment day) is that you’re almost positive your boss is going to give you the good piece, the mother of all stories, the silver platter of all newsworthy gossip. Your stories have increased company views, you’ve come up with several new ideas to help keep the physical and online newsletters going, and you’ve been bringing in tasty treats every Friday for the past month. The big boss man has been nothing but cheery towards you, which is a rare sight on its own, but to have him in a good mood for this long? Good things are ahead, good things are ahead indeed.

you those doe eyes.The glorious freedom you were
fantasizing about disappears in an instant. “Why?”“Maybe he got into some trouble and
needs help.” You decide she’s much nicer than
you. “Or maybe, hear me out, just maybe, he’s decided to skip work today
and continue being the inconsiderate jerk he is.” You have no such patience for
him, but that might be because you still remember the heat of his lips nipping
at yours. Or maybe it’s because the marks he left on your thighs still remain

original story based on a request by @bts-lys: truce part one • part two 
masterlistYou huff as you shuffle down the steps of the
Slytherin common room, tugging at your tie to finally loosen it and
give yourself some room to breathe. Your eyes are drooping and your shoulders
are hanging low, your feet aching from walking around the castle for hours.
Even worse, you can’t go to bed yet – you haven’t gotten the chance to finish
all your homework.Patrol duty
fucking sucks.The common
room is cold and empty, as it always is at this hour. The chairs and tables
that litter the room are deserted, with only the occasional forgotten feather
or roll of parchment left behind. The lake’s usual greenish glow that shines
through the windows isn’t there, and the only light is coming from the torches
lining the walls, flames flickering and casting erratic shadows on the stone
floor.Your eye falls
on the couches by the fireplace and you notice a mop of pale hair leaning on
the backrest of the dark leather couch. Raising an eyebrow, you freeze in your
tracks just before you get off the final step, tilting your head – his lips are
parted, eyes fluttered closed. There’s a book resting on his stomach and his
hands are loosely holding onto it, his chest slowly rising and falling as he
softly breathes in and out.A grin
starts to tug at your lips and you perk up – all your tiredness seems to slip right
out of you. Perfect. Keep reading

            ENEMIES | Series Masterlist        Originally posted by tearuntoldKeep your friends close, but your enemies closer. Characters | OT7 x ReaderGenre | enemies to lovers!au (everything in this series is basically e2l!au), lots of bickering, playful arguing, lowkey pining, fluff, angst, and humor.Est. Date | December 2019 - UPDATED to May 2020Rendezvous | Jungkook (e2l!au and college!au)Jungkook hates you for all the wrong reasons, and you could hate him for all the right ones. It all starts with a stupid high school crush and an unforgettable rejection. But when university strolls around, Jungkook’s not sure if he should continue hating you just because you don’t.Gold | Namjoon (e2l!au and college!au)Put two top students in the faculty together and you get the best enemies you could ever imagine. Expect competition, endless arguments, sweet sabotage, and lots of opportunities for stupid bickering. But what happens when one gets hurt and the other falls in love?Homebody | Taehyung (e2l!au and roommate!au)It doesn’t take a lot of Taehyung’s effort to piss you off. All it takes is a week’s worth of his laundry sprawled all over the living room, accidentally pouring expired milk in your tea, and snoozing through ten of his alarms. But when his ex-girlfriend (the one he’s still painfully in love with) invites him and a plus one to her wedding, you offer him a proposition that might just give the both of you the benefit of the doubt.Nostalgia | Jimin (e2l!au, RA!jimin, RA!reader, and college!au)Elegant, critical, smart, handsome, and gentle. You’ve always thought of Jimin as your ideal type in human form. That is, until he started criticizing your physics research paper. Who knew your ideal type was just an enemy in disguise?Lowkey | Hoseok (e2l!au, athlete!hoseok, and college!au)Hoseok doesn’t like you, but he loves acting like he does. It’s his way of teasing you, his one and only enemy. But there’s nothing to worry on your end because you know that it’s all an act. But when you start playing along with Hoseok’s gimmick as a method of your sweet revenge, Hoseok’s not sure what’s real and what’s not.Shouldn’t Couldn’t Wouldn’t | Seokjin (e2l!au and CEO!seokjin)Working for Kim Seokjin, one of South Korea’s billionaires and CEO of the country’s leading cosmetics brand, is a huge nightmare you wish you could wake up from. It’s almost as if your efforts go to waste because he treats you, his secretary, like shit. It’s painfully obvious that he hates you for some odd reason and is dying to fire you. But when you finally beat him to it and quit the job, you get hired by a competitor and suddenly he’s doing everything to get you back. He just doesn’t expect himself falling for you throughout the whole process.Me &amp; You | Yoongi (e2l! and athlete!yoongi)Yoongi hates you for two reasons. 1. He lost his scholarship because of you and 2. it’s all because you’re too brutally honest. After coming clean for cheating off of your exam paper and accepting the consequence of paying his own tuition expenses, you offer being his tutor for a year in compensation. You just didn’t expect him to take up on your offer.author’s note | it’s been a while since i started writing on this blog and i decided to write my first series. what inspired this was the fact that i absolutely love e2l!au and it was just coincidence that i love writing e2l!au so i decided, let’s just do it! since i’m going to be writing all of this, it’s going to take some time to get them done, but i’ll definitely try to post the first installment of this series by the end of the year. i’m super duper excited and i hope you are!

            perihelion | 02        —   02 || soleil  —▸pairing: hoseok x reader▸genre: hybrid au, uni/college au, roommate au, e2l▸words: 11.1k+▸rating: sfw▸warnings: some cheeky hijinks in the closet, tension &amp; some rude remarks▸notes: its starting to heat up!! UGH the next parts will start to have some smutty pieces :3 I’m keen bitches!!!You’d think being mutually duped by your dodgy landlord would be more than enough common ground to bring you together, but somehow, with Hoseok, it did the opposite. You both signed the lease though, so now you were stuck with each other whether you liked it or not. At least he was cute, even if he did spend the better half of his time glaring at you.— posted: 24.11.2018 || — 
 I will reblog with links!Waking up, for you, was never a fun
time. You always wondered what it would be like for morning people— did they
wake up already genuinely enthused for the day ahead of them? Or did they have
to lay in bed and work themselves up to it? Either way, you owed them mad
respect— you’d been lying in bed for the past forty-five minutes on your phone,
trying to muster the will to leave the warmth and comfort of your blankets and
painstakingly collected pillows, and the only reason you were literally forcing
yourself to roll out now was because the clock was ticking dangerously
closer to the time you had to be out the door to meet your friends for a study
date. You’d woken up before Hoseok, but in the time you’d spent procrastinating
your morning and prolonging the inevitable he’d risen and gone the whole nine
miles— you’d heard him pouring cereal and then heard the usual symphony of
groaning pipes in the walls as he went for a shower. Admittedly, the fact that
he had been able to get up with more ease than you was a contributing factor
that drove you to the point you were at now. You really couldn’t stand it when
he was blatantly so much less of a mess than you. You had a reputation to
uphold and he was damaging it simply by existing in such close proximity.So here you were, easing from the
warmth, comfort and security of your bed with all the speed and grace of an
elderly woman well past her prime. You could have sworn you heard your bones
and joints creaking, but dismissed it optimistically as the pipes once more.
How ever had the landlord managed to pass an inspection? This place was falling
apart at the seams, honestly.  Keep reading

            Concentric [19]        masterlistWords: 7.3kGenres: fantasy!AU, angst, fluff, enemies to lovers, eventual smut (?)Warnings: n/aSummary: You had been ready for the end of the semester. You had been ready to spend time away from your best friend, Jimin, and finally move on from the feelings you harbored. Yet, after your friend was forced to reveal a secret, you found yourself in a new world that was chock full of magic, war, and wonder. So, here you were, basically thrown into your own fantasy novel, with your best friend on one side, and six male warriors on the other.A/N: A big squishy thank you to everyone for being so understanding and patient… I hope you engoy! 💙You continued drinking in the world that was so entirely
new, yet also so exactly the same as it had been before.Your eyes drifted over to the sunlight cascading through the
tree limbs like golden waterfalls.Skin tingled as the wind traced cool pathways against your
body.Lungs inhaled to breathe in the dirt, the moss, the sweet
air, and the mind-reeling scent of the male before you.And then your breath caught as Jungkook slowly slid his hand
from your nape to your cheek, his fingers leaving a trail of soothing warmth as
they moved.Bringing your eyes back to his, the burgundy-haired Saeni
grinned at you as he caressed his thumb across your cheekbone once before
taking a step back. While the wind rustled his hair and he crossed his arms
over his chest, a smile slowly overtook your features until you released a
stream of amazed laughter. Turning in a circle, you took in the familiar world
that was now so curiously new with bright eyes, and as you turned, you caught
sight of the kiela smiling fondly at
your wonder. Inhaling, you outstretched your arms and tipped your head back,
closing your eyes and relishing in all the new feelings blanketing your senses. Keep reading

            paddle with me | jjk [teaser 2]        summary; when your camp leader forces you and jeongguk as partners in a team building activity. with frustrations and anger flaring during your journey down the river, how will all this pent-up emotion get released? pairing; jeongguk x readergenre; campcounselor!au | e2l | rivals | smutrating; M(18+)word count; estimated 6k not anymore, i’m not even half way through the smut and i’ve surpassed my estimatewarnings; outdoor smut (detail warning list when complete)teaser warnings; cussing—a/n;i updated the moodboard per a friends recommendation &lt;3i also said this would be done by the end of august, but i forgot i have a two week vacation coming up so perhaps i’ll stick to that. if not, september it is!TEASER ONEMASTERLIST — preview;All of a sudden, Jeongguk moves towards you. He lifts his leg over your body, being the one to straddle you this time. With his hands on your shoulders, he forcefully pushes you down into the sand with a grunt. Your breath escapes you at the unexpected shove. “Can you just shut the fuck up for one minute?”He leans over you, face hovering above yours, fingers digging into the sand on either side of your head. Water falls from the tips of his hair onto your face and the ground beside you. You’re still beneath him, not moving out of shock at his sudden action, he’s never been one to react on impulse. You stare into his gaze, trying to stay calm as he continues his tirade.“I’m done with your attitude and sass. You’ve hit my last nerve and I’m not putting up with your shit.” Now it’s his turn to trail his eyes to your lips, just like you did moments before. Being on top of you like this is clouding his judgment, he knows he shouldn’t be doing this. “You drive me insane with that smart mouth of yours.”Your lips part slightly as you’re about to retort to his insult, but his lips find yours, silencing you. Jeongguk takes the opportunity to slip his tongue into your mouth, practically breathing fire into the kiss as your teeth clash with harsh and desperate movements. He’s rough this time, he has no intention of being gentle as you’ve been nothing but a pain in his ass for years.— all rights reserved © 2020 yoongs-jeontaecopying / redistributing the work is not allowed— taglist; @nottodayjjk @ggukkieland @ooohami @millie-ionaire05 @whalerus @misohime @catastrophe-at-sixteen @fadedforestnymph @vorejeon​ @kookphoria91​

            i hate you too || jjk        ⇁ pairing:  Jungkook x reader⇁ genre: e2l kinda, fluff, crack⇁ warnings: some playful insults⇁ word count: 1.7k⇁ summary: Jungkook made the fatal mistake of eating your cookies.The dark-haired maknae made his way downstairs, ugly Christmas sweater on full display as he approached one of his hyungs in the living-room, taking a seat in front of the fireplace.“What do we have for lunch?” he asked, hunger already making itself known although it was just past noon. Before Yoongi could answer the question, loud yelling was heard from the kitchen.“YOUR HEAD ON A PLATTER, THAT’S WHAT WE HAVE FOR LUNCH, DON’T EVEN THINK OF COMING NEAR MY KITCHEN, JEON.” Jungkook grimaced at that, almost as if the voice was shouting in his ear and Yoongi tried to muffle a laugh at the youngest.“What did you do to get her to threaten you?” he asked when we finally calmed down and Jungkook just groaned and fell back into the couch.“It’s a looooong story.” he signed when his hyung motioned for him to go on. “Well, you see, I woke up second this morning, after Noona. And when I came downstairs, I was hungry and there were these cute little Christmas tree-shaped cookies, fresh out of the oven, sitting on the counter, just waiting to be eaten. And well.. I dug in. Ate about half by the time she returned to the kitchen.” he heard an angry groan coming from the kitchen and he kind of cowered in fear before going on. “In my defense, I just thought they were there for us to eat, because they were unguarded!” he raised his voice so you could hear from the kitchen. “But then she caught me and almost killed me on the spot. So now, I’m not allowed in the kitchen anymore.” he pouted and crossed his arms over his chest, loud laughing echoing through the cabin as Taehyung and Jimin joined them in the lounge area.
