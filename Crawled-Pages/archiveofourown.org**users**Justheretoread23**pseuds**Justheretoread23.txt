    Summary
      I don't want to die. Sakura turns her head towards where she believes her teammates are. I'm going to try. Her hands reach into her pouch as Haku stalks over to her at a slow pace. I can buy Kakashi-sensei some time. Hopefully. Energy seemingly renewed, Sakura rolls over and gets to her feet. Breathing heavy, she falls into a defensive stance.

    Summary
      Give them a bit of experience, Mizuki had said.
Let them get a taste of what they might want to do with their career, he’d insisted.
Iruka stared down at the file - Haruno Sakura, assigned to Torture and Interrogation.
...What the fuck.
