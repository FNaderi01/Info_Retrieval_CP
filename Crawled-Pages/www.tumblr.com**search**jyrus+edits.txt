10I think a lot about Jonah and TJ. About how they seem like¬†such different people, but they actually have very similar journeys to self-acceptance.¬†Both boys were popular. Both boys were jocks. Both boys had an Image they had to maintain: Jonah as the sunshine optimist who everyone loved; TJ as the uncaring, talented captain who everyone feared. Both project extreme confidence.But it is incredibly stressful to try and maintain such a rigid persona. And when something happens within you that contradicts that persona, you push against it. You‚Äôre ashamed of it. How can Jonah be the happy optimist if he gets panic attacks that make him feel nothing but sadness and fear? How can TJ be a respected captain on the court if there‚Äôs something broken in his brain?¬†You fear that this will change the way people see you. Will people see Jonah now as scared, sad, vulnerable? Will people see TJ as broken, less than? Will people pity them? Will people see them as diagnoses, instead of people? Will everything change, now that they‚Äôre different?But Cyrus Goodman. Cyrus, the goofy, non-athletic, Certified Noodle Boy, who wears his insecurity like a badge of honor, is the one who instills the confidence back into these two boys.¬†He tells Jonah: yeah, you get panic attacks. Yes, you might keep getting them, but you can learn tools to deal with them. You are still Jonah Beck. Panic attacks are something you get, they are not something you are.¬†He tells TJ: yeah, you have a learning disability. Yes, that means your brain works differently than some peoples‚Äô, but now that you know that, you can learn tools to work with it. You are still TJ Kippen. A learning disability is something you have, it is not something you are.¬†And they believe Cyrus. Because of course they do. Because Cyrus has been there for both of them, through everything, always, and he shows them again and again that they will be okay. That these things do not make them weaker at all. Everybody has stuff they gotta deal with. They aren‚Äôt alone. It‚Äôs what Buffy said to Cyrus, that fateful day in The Spoon:¬†They are no different.Often times in Kids/ Young Adult TV Shows, the character ‚Äúroles‚Äù that Jonah and TJ fill would be very one dimensional: The Cute Love Interest and the Bully. But Andi Mack rejects that completely. The Cute Love interest deals with panic attacks, financial insecurity, and a rejection of traditional romantic partnerships. The Bully deals with a learning disability, the rocky path to redemption, and the acceptance of his sexuality. The Cute Love Interest ends the show single, and is able to say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù to a girl he now considers a best friend. The Bully ends the show in a relationship with the boy who inspired him to change in the first place. The Cute Love Interest ends the show hugging his friend; The Bully ends the show holding hands with his boyfriend. They are not archetypes. They are not plot devices for the main characters. They are Jonah and TJ: two dirty-blonde, green-eyed athletes who finally learned to let their walls down, and accept every part of who they are.¬†

I know it is difficult to understand the great love that someone can feel for us, especially when we are afraid of being ourselves or when we do not even know with certainty who we are, it is hard to believe that they will not abandon us.Andi mack + Gifs
