Chemotherapy Tuesday, I feel
uncharacteristically hopeful, not necessarily in a cure for my illness, but in
a resolution for that debilitating feeling of disconnect. When you’re
diagnosed, it feels a bit like yielding a very sharp knife, cutting all the
tethers that anchor you to life, to a sense of self and to normalcy. For once,
life is calling me from that place, instead of looming death. When
I enter the room, he is already there, this time cradling his own tablet like an
infant’s head in his big palm. I wave in greeting and he smiles back
momentarily, but keeps reading, thoroughly enthralled. Pterodactyl (small, quirky and slightly unnerving)
comes to plug me in and I expect Jamie to initiate conversation, just as he did
the day before. His eyes are fixed on the screen, wide and still-lake blue, and
by the look on his face he might be reading The
Book of Revelation.I
try to distract myself by looking at the treatment room’s decoration - or lack thereof -, remarkably naked of
gimcrack and gewgaw, with a sole picture of a sunny field occupying the large
wall. I guess there’s no point in trying to make such a place more suitable for
the living; cancer ruins any attempt at proper feng shui. “No
chit-chat today, huh?” I tease after a while, hopelessly eager to be standing
in the sun of his smiling blue eyes yet again. “‘Tis
the most engrossing read, Sassenach.”
He nods gravely and smiles in a way that makes my solar plexus do a full spin,
his handsome face like a pinch in between ribs, straight into the frailty
amidst bone. A dark suspicion that he’s reading the complete works of LadyCurlyWig_1 creeps in, and I’m both
mortified and elated. I
purse my lips, decided to be the coolest
of cool, eyeing the drip of chemo as I tap my index finger against my thigh
rhythmically. My eyes keep seeking his face (the scar on his temple the size of my thumb’s nail, the patches of
blonde stubble on his jaw, the tiny mole on the back of his right ear) and
I notice the puzzled frown of his brows as soon as it dawns, the way his mouth
opens and closes in quick succession.“Your
cogs must be rusty,” I point sheepishly, playing with my earring. “I
can hear them turning from over here.” Continuar a ler
