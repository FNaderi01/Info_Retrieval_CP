    Summary
      “He may be too small for such weight,” she says. “Any decent protection may be too much.”“Not full armor,” he says. “I was thinking vambraces. Enough to show, but not real protection. Thinner, lighter. It would have to be redone if he still grows, but it would be enough.”“Hm.” The Armorer looks at him, then nods. “I see what you mean. I will see what can work.”-----The child receives his first beskar armor.
