    Summary
  'Your handwriting is shit.'
Allen Walker walks into class to find this note on his desk, but on top of homework, devilish professors, and a jerk haunting his workplace, he really doesn't have the time to be exchanging notes with some stranger. Common sense doesn't seem to be stopping him, though.
  'And you're an asshole.'
