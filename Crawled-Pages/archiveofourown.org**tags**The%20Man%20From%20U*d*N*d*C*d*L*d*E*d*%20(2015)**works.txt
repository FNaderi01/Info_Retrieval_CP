    Summary
      “Here it says ‘missing’,” she’d babbled hysterically, five months ago. She kept pointing to the letter Waverly had received from the Russians after Illya had failed to return from a reconnaissance mission to Vladivostok. “That’s not… it can’t mean he’s—"“Gaby,” Waverly had said while holding her hand, “I don’t want you to indulge in any kind of false hope. ‘Agent Kuryakin is missing, presumed dead’ – that’s KGB parlance for ‘We’re quite certain he’s not coming back.’”A few weeks after that, she’d started getting morning sickness.

    Summary
      “Look,” Solo tries again, “this little feud, or whatever, it’s stupid, right? Fuck all these people and their thirst for drama.” He gestures blindly behind him, and Illya can’t help but notice a few of their gawkers looking away, chastised. “Isn’t it time to move beyond all that?”Gaby is looking between them incredulously, clearly waiting for Illya’s response and expecting it to be a vehement fuck off. But the thing is, he has a point, doesn’t he? It’s not like Illya’s been blameless in their war. He has as much metaphorical blood on his hands as Solo does, and honestly it’s getting tiring. They have a lot in common, which is pretty much the problem, but that shouldn’t mean they’re destined to be mortal enemies. Even in academia.(Napoleon and Illya might disagree on pretty much everything, but with looming tenure decisions at their respective universities, the common ground they find leads to more than just an unexpected camaraderie.)
