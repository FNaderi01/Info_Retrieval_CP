    Summary
      Atsushi remembered dying.And now he was here, defending young brunette boys from bullies, practically getting adopted by small mice children, and adopting said small mice children in return. Sure it wasn't heaven or at all what he'd expected, but at least he got away from having to fight the mafia, right? And oh hello, who is this fedora-wearing baby standing next to the mailbox? (Inspired by bonesetblues's 'curiosity kills the cat (but satisfaction brings it back)'

    Summary
      At the age of 4, Midoriya Izuku was diagnosed quirkless. The doctor couldn't be more wrong, though.
After all, that amount of cuteness in only one person can't be usual.

    Summary
      Tsuna’s never craved the spotlight like Ienari does, preferring to keep quiet and stay on the sidelines, so it’s only natural for his brother to stand out so much more. But being different – being himself – means a mother who calls him useless and a brother who bullies him without remorse, and Tsuna doesn’t have enough tolerance to overlook either for very long. He won’t change who he is just to make them like him though so he takes the only option left – he leaves. Three years later, Reborn arrives to train Nari, only to discover that there’s one Sawada missing.

    Summary
      “Belos gave me a choice. He told me to get rid of Luz, one way or another. And I did. Now everyone’s back in the realm they belong in, nobody got hurt and Luz is forever out of danger. It’s best for everyone involved that way.”“Keep telling yourself that, Lily.” Eda glared daggers at her sister. “Oh, and solid job on locking your own protégée out of the Boiling Isles, by the way.”“What are you talking about?”“Amity went through the door after Luz,” Emira chimed in. Her voice was scarily monotone. “Now she’s trapped on the other side of the portal you just destroyed.”—Summer has come to an end, which means Luz is forced to return from ‘summer camp’ and resume her regular life back at home with her mom. When she leaves, she promises she’ll be back soon.Unable to overcome her fear of telling Luz how she feels about her before she steps through the door, Amity finally finds the courage to do it when the door closes behind Luz and makes the rash decision to follow her.Then something goes wrong, and now Amity is stuck in Luz’s realm with her crush, far away from everything she’s ever known.Getting back home might prove more difficult than she’d originally hoped...
