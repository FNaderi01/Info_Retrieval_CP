 ANNEX 2. PERMITTED SUBSTANCES FOR
THE PRODUCTION OF ORGANIC FOODS
 Precautions
 Precautions1. Any substances used in an organic system for soil
fertilization and conditioning, pest and disease control, for the health of
livestock and quality of the animal products, or for preparation, preservation
and storage of the food product should comply with the relevant national
regulations.2. Conditions for use of certain substances contained in the
following lists may be specified by the certification body or authority, e.g.
volume, frequency of application, specific purpose, etc.3. Where substances are required for primary production they
should be used with care and with the knowledge that even permitted substances
may be subject to misuse and may alter the ecosystem of the soil or
farm.4. The following lists do not attempt to be all inclusive or
exclusive, or a finite regulatory tool but rather provide advice to governments
on internationally agreed inputs. A system of review criteria as detailed in
Section 5 of these Guidelines for products to be considered by national
governments should be the primary determinant for acceptability or rejection of
substances.TABLE 1: SUBSTANCES FOR USE IN SOIL FERTILIZING AND
