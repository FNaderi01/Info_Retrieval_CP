                                                                Hi.Okay so I know that my last post or my “explanation” (if you could call it that) was really crappy, and I think that you guys deserve a real explanation.So I met this guy, and as some of you can recall, I’ve never fallen in love before, but I fell for this one. He was funny, sensitive, quite the troublemaker, and has a bit of a temper, and I knew him before, and I just fell for him when we met again, and he loved me back. But then while I was with him, he started making me question everything I believed in, and it scared me…This one person, this guy was scaring the living fuck out of me! So I left. I left him. And I don’t know if it hurt him, but there’s one thing I know… It hurt me. After moping around for a week, I realized that this isn’t fucking Twilight. I’m not Bella fucking Swan. I can’t let a guy control my life. I can’t let him ruin my day. So I pulled out my laptop, and started this blog up again. And that’s how we ended up here.

I was dealing with some problems that I needed to deal with and I got so caught up I barely had the chance to check on this blog and I’m just so sorry… But I’m free and I can write whatever your hearts desire and… I’m also adding a new fandom to write!!! and that is… Once Upon A Time!!! BTW I watched episode 1 of the second season of Riverdale and I LOVED IT! ESPECIALLY THE MUSIC THEY USED FOR THE EPISODE OMG!
