(no subject)I did not finish the thing I started for lupercalia, but then pornday was declared, and since I was in theory spending the evening moving my old writing files to the new laptop, and because I am finally over my long winter sick enough that it seemed doable, I pulled out my second-oldest pwp wip and stuck it over there (it will probably go on my AO3 eventually, although possibly under one of my old pseuds because I don't think any of my subscribers expect pwp anymore.) It is extremely kinky geeky est rel f/f for two one-off characters from a Fourth Doctor serial, because I have to stay on model in some ways, at least:Slow Fire, Vivien Fay/Amelia Rumford.***Anyway here is that trope meme that's been going around DW, via about ten people:Slow burn OR love at first sight: Slow burn, unless the love at first sight is subverted or worldbuilt somehow. Fake dating OR secret dating: Fake dating! Marriage-of-convenience-that-we-pretend-is-real is even better.Enemies to lovers OR best friends to lovers: all possible permutations of these three, please.Oh no there's only one bed OR long distance with correspondence: Correspondence, but only if it's really well done; only one bed but only if it's meta.Fantasy au OR modern au: Modern fantasy AU is usually better than either!Smut OR fluff: Fluff is kind of ill-defined, but if we're going for the all-out shameless versions, good smut is better than spun sugar froth.Mutual pining OR domestic bliss: Domestic bliss! But fewer people know how to write really good domestic bliss, whereas fandom has the mutual pining formula down, so I'm probably more likely to read that.Alternate universe OR future fic: It really really depends on the canon for this one. (...also I tend to wind up in canons where all future fic is AU...)One shot OR multi-chapter: My sweet spot these days is ~25000 words, and at that length either a half-dozen chapters or a one-shot is fine. As long as it's not a wip.Kid fic OR road trip fic: Kid fic if it's good! Roadtrip fic with kids along is best.Reincarnation OR character death: Reincarnation depends a lot for me on the fandom and the setup, but character death I only like if it's clearly temporary.Arranged marriage OR accidental marriage: Accidental marriage, but the "oopsie we didn't realize that was legally valid" kind or the "aliens made us do it" kind much preferred to the "we got drunk in Vegas" kind. I really like political etc. marriage, but prefer the people involved to be the ones doing most of the arranging.Time travel OR isolated together: Both! This is why I want time loops with more than one person in them. Also anything where they get stuck in the Mesozoic together (as long as the dinosaurs have feathers.)Neighbors OR roommates: Neighbors, but mostly because that's way less likely to be a college AU. Don't really see the difference otherwise.Sci-fi au OR magic au: Spaaaace.Bodyswap OR genderbend: Bodyswap, but I like it when bodyswap is used to explore some of the same issues that come up in genderbend but from different angles.Angst OR crack: Angsty crack.Apocalyptic OR mundane: "We are building a new community and family from the ashes of the old world" YES, especially if there's gardening and competence porn. Zombies etc. not so much.

Smut OR fluff: Fluff is kind of ill-defined, but if we're going for the all-out shameless versions, good smut is better than spun sugar froth.Heh. To me this reads like "good smut is better than bad fluff", which, yeah... ;-)Angst OR crack: Angsty crack.Yessss! :-D

I think deep down I believe that of it has any substance whatsoever it's not pure fluff. If becomes just a happy story with fluff in it, or maybe comfort fic. Whereas good smut will have enough substance to be interesting even if I'm not that into the sex.If it's bad smut vs. bad fluff I pick fluff though, it's less likely to hit the embarrassment squick.

I got Enemies to Lovers to Roommates to Enemies to Lovers and I don't know any of those either, but boy is that evocative.

Man, that sounds like it could be an eternal cycle and I want to read it.

If I did, it was probably Loki/(Tony)/Steve post-Avengers fic. Nothing is immediately coming to mind but I wouldn't be surprised if there is one! I've definitely at least read a couple where it's enemies - metamours - friends.

I can never answer this meme because my answer to so many of these questions would be either, "Why not both?" or, "Neither! Both out."

Based on the answers I'm seeing around, I think those are perfectly valid responses!
