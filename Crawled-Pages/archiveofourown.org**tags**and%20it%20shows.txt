    Summary
      Set during/around the concluding scenes of "The Owl of Minerva," this fic explores a version of events in which the relationship between Inspector Sullivan and Father Brown actually does develop in light of the episode's dramatic events, and in which we get to see a little more of what lies beneath the inspector's carefully opaque, sometimes brittle façade, and his frequently merciless passion for order.

    Summary
      What if Alec and Magnus had already met during that Pandemonium scene in the very first episode?
-
Or, how things might have gone if Magnus and Alec had just had a few extra days to get to know each other, before Valentine’s schemes, Clary’s various crusades, Lightwood family history revelations and Clave-Downworld politics made everything more difficult for them than it really needed to be.
It truly might have made all the difference in the world.

    Summary
      Ten minutes to go to ground zero and Artyom was still desperately trying to escape. “I have never attended little girl’s birthday party,” he pointed out repeatedly, and actually pouted, big blue eyes wide and pleading. “Always a first time,” Napoleon said mercilessly, pulling on a charcoal Tom Ford blazer over his loose gray knit. “Mrs Siegfried invited us weeks ago, Artyom, don’t be a baby. You’ve had quite a while to gird your loins. We’re going to a party, not some sort of trench warfare. Smile.” Artyom scowled, which was admittedly normally an adorable look even for a tall, blonde Russian giant of a man. “I do not like Mrs Siegfried,” Artyom declared, clearly intent on being as recalcitrant as possible.
