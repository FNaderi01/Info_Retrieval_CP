    Summary
      Inspired by; Castle on the Hill by Ed Sheeran.~~~~~Anastasia huffed, a smirk twitching at her lips as she gestured towards a classroom down the hall. “Especially because I did detention in there at least once a week. I can’t even tell you how many times I was brought to look at these pictures by teachers I’d irritated and told I’d never see my face up there if I didn’t start conforming and stop pretending I couldn’t understand English anytime somebody said something I didn’t like or assigned work I didn’t feel like doing.”“You still pretend you don’t understand English whenever somebody says something you don’t like or asks you to do something you don’t feel like doing.” She chuckled. “You did it this morning when I asked you why, at your age, you still thought cheesecake was an appropriate breakfast food.”Anastasia blinked at her and when she spoke, she purposely thickened her accent and did her best to look clueless to what she’d just said. “I don’t understand.”All the blood in Kamilah’s body rose to her cheeks and an amused sigh escaped from the back of her throat. “You have no business being this adorable. Stop it at once.”“Either make me or spank me.”

    Summary
      While struggling with nightmares of lives she’s never lived, a shadow from the past looming over her city, and the proposed idea that her life may just be a little bit too weird to handle alone, Nadya makes sure to tell herself that everything is perfect just the way it is. If only. When the self-proclaimed King of Vampires (and Maker of her sometimes-girlfriend and always-boss, can’t forget that little tidbit) Gaius Augustine returns intent on claiming Manhattan as the throne that was promised, she and her friends find themselves forced into the task of saving the world. But with millennia-old vampires and an Order of hunters on their heels as well as allies hiding catastrophic secrets at their backs… it won’t be an easy task. Too bad destiny didn’t exactly ask for her input.Book 4 in the Oblivion Bound series; focusing on Nadya and the events of Bloodbound 2. In Progress.

    Summary
      Inspired by; Tell Me by Johnny Jewel ft. Saoirse Ronan.~~~~~“We’re jumping into the ocean whilst fully clothed, come on,” Adrian said without elaborating on why anyone would do such a thing.“Awesome!,” Anastasia laughed as she looped an arm through hers. It never ceased to amaze her how excited her wife was to do simple things like this, she really had no business being this adorable. It was simply fact.“It was Lily’s idea,” Serafine shrugged. Far be it from her to veto a stupid plan.Kamilah scoffed and looked down at her perfectly tailored suit. When she spoke, her words were really more of an irritated grumble, “I am wearing Armani haute couture.”“Who peed in your Cheerios?,” Lily pouted.She sighed and moved her mouth to Anastasia’s ear and whispered, “This is exactly why you should’ve let me bring my daggers. She has somehow drank twelve cocktails in the past hour and now wants to drown herself and us in the process... this seems like a knives situation.”

    Summary
      Inspired by; Perfect by One Direction.~~~~~“I might’ve been a little jealous,” Kamilah whispered in her ear, all pretense gone. When — like her — people had accumulated so much money that they could do anything, buy anything, be anything, then they started to look around for the things that money couldn’t buy. Strength, courage, nobility... they saw it in others. And they wanted it. And Kamilah wanted her. “Indeed... I think I may have been fairly jealous, now that I stop to really consider the notion.”“You’re the only one I want to kiss like that,” she whispered back, affectionately nuzzling her shoulder and head-butting at her in delight. She truly didn’t mind that Kamilah was jealous, regardless of how some people when their partners felt that way. It was all tied up with what was inside a person. Head and heart, mind and soul. Who they were and what they wanted — that was what fuelled it. That was what shaped it — and it could be hot if it was expressed in a healthy way. “You don't think I'm crazy?,” Kamilah asked hesitantly."Like I'm one to judge another persons sanity.” She kissed her hair and whispered, her voice low and breathy, “I’m yours.”“And I, yours.”

    Summary
      Inspired by; Killer Queen by Queen.~~~~~“Serafine is dating a mortal who claims to be sexually attracted to plants as well as people and she’s just going along with it because she’s getting pussy—““Excuse me?,” she laughed. “When you mute the group chat you miss important details, Kami.”“Her new girlfriend is definitely a psychopath and I forbid this relationship from progressing any further.”Anastasia snorted. “You forbid it, do you?”“I’m putting my foot down. If this continues, the next thing we know Serafine will have run off to join a cult or something, and we all know who will have to go rescue her when that eventually goes south. If I have to rescue one more member of this family from a cult I will not be pleased,” she huffed as she typed out a belligerent text message to Serafine. She was extremely protective of the people she loved, even if her attempts at making sure people didn’t inadvertently get themselves kidnapped or killed could come across as her being overly controlling. “Mortals. Bloody mortals. Sexually attracted to plants. I’ve heard it all. What, does she get herself off looking at those little house plants she has in her bedroom?”

      Inspired by; Life On Mars? by David Bowie.~~~~~“First bubble baths. Then a love for gardening. Now Disney parks. You're shattering every creepy vampire myth I've ever heard, Kami,” Anastasia teased.Kamilah sighed. “This entire thing is utterly ridiculous.”“That’s what you get for thinking you could beat Lily at beer pong. We’d be in Monte Carlo right now if you’d challenged her to any other drinking game.”“It all happened so fast. Important things always seem to, don't they?” She pinched the bridge of her nose and sighed. “We’re vampires! We’re dangerous creatures who are almost always in some sort of life and death situation! Death follows us like a bullet, and they’re on the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad?”“Splash Mountain, actually.”“This place has one too many mountains for my liking. They’re all the same.”Anastasia smirked. “Are they, though?”

    Summary
      Inspired by; The Night We Met by Gavin Mikhail {acoustic version}~~~~~“Shut up!,” she barked as she tore the katana out of Anastasia’s chest, not realising that tears were freely pouring down both of her cheeks. Some had patience. She did not. She turned to Adrian with angry crimson eyes and threw the bloody sword over his shoulder so that it lodged itself in the wall behind him. Under normal circumstances she’d have felt bad about losing her temper to this degree with him but at the current moment she couldn’t have cared less about anyone’s feelings. The love of her life had just bled to death in her arms and unless she woke up... nothing would mean anything anymore. “Don’t even start with me! This is all I can do to make sure I don't lose her. The one thing I should never have had in the first place. When she wakes she can curse me, spit on me, ignore me, and pretend I don't even exist, but at least she will be alive. I will not leave her or allow her to just cease to exist after only twenty-two years on this Earth. I will do whatever I have to do to keep her safe. To keep her here. To see her well. Because her safety, her life... her— she is all that matters to me!”

    Summary
      Inspired by; Safe &amp; Sound by Julia Sheer {Taylor Swift cover}~~~~~It was so strange to her that she was even considering discussing her time in Pompeii. She’d staked men in the chest for even uttering the moniker The Reaper of Pompeii in her presence. She’d once smashed a wine bottle and slashed Gaius on the cheek with a shard of broken glass for taunting her with it... and he’d retaliated, of course. She’d walked away worse than he did, of course. Yet here she was, cocooned in her wife’s arms and crying like a child over her own misdeeds... and despite how much she feared telling her story, she knew that she needed to get it off her chest or it would haunt her for another thousand years.

    Summary
      Inspired by; Nightingale by Demi Lovato.~~~~~“Kamilah, please look at me,” Anastasia said softly as she sat down on the arm of the chair Kamilah was sitting in. Everyone else was dead asleep as Adrian’s jet surged towards Japan, exhausted down to their bones after their night at the bacchanalia. Kamilah, however, had positioned herself as far from everyone as she possibly could and was sitting with her head rested in one hand and a half empty bottle of whiskey in the other — the empty bottle of Smirnoff rested on the seat next to her gave away that she’d been drinking for quite a while. Sometimes the sort of solitude she imposed on herself could be blinding.“I’m no different than he is,” the ancient vampire muttered, more to herself than to her. She didn’t meet her eyes, and that alone told Anastasia all she needed to know about how Rheya’s mind control had fucked up her mental state. Eye contact wasn’t something that intimidated Kamilah Sayeed, she just didn’t want her to see the tears that were swimming there. “I hurt you. My hands were around your neck—“

    Summary
      Inspired by; 100 Bandaids by Faouzia {stripped version}~~~~~“Annie?,” she said softly as she slipped inside the room, freezing in the doorway at the sight of Anastasia. She was hunched over on the bed, clutching a pillow to her chest, her hair messed up in a way that made it look as if she’d been pulling at it, her face drenched with tears. The hurt in her eyes made Kamilah’s ancient heart clench in her chest, how could a mortal endure that much pain and keep on living? Her glacial gaze was starting to eat away at her insides. Razor-blade butterflies whirled in her heart. “Please don’t look at me like this,” the mortal sobbed, burying her face in the pillow. “Its... better if you don’t see me like this. If you can’t see my scars, you can pretend that they don’t exist.” Her voice was hoarse and distant when she spoke, and filled with fear. As if she was repeating word-for-word what someone else had once said to her after seeing her this way. “Please go— you’ll— you’ll never look at me the same way after this. I’m a mess.”

They started out on my floor. Are you fucking Anastasia in the goddamn elevator five minutes after I told you not to fuck my fucking assistant?”“What sort of a friend interrupts another friend’s orgasms?,” Kamilah groaned. “We may have to continue this elsewhere before some mewling mortal calls the fire department.”“He never swears,” Anastasia laughed, breathlessly.“He does it when he is trying to sound intimidating, not realising he sounds like a ten year old swearing behind his mother’s back— are there cameras in here?”“No.”“I was going to flip him off,” the vampire pouted, seemingly genuinely irritated that she couldn’t.

Even if I did like her like that, there could be no real future there unless she Turned... and I would not wish the life of a vampire upon anybody, let alone someone I— Any happiness I could potentially have with her would be little more than an illusion.”“It is better to be truly happy for a short while than to be miserable for all of your days. Happiness is not always where you think. Fear can make you run from it. You must look deep to see what you really want, Kamilah.”“What if I don’t know what it is that I want?”“You’re the smartest person I know, so stop that. You and I both know you’ve known what you wanted since the moment you first saw her. There’s no point in hiding from the truth anymore, no reason to lie.” He sighed. “I grieve my darling Eleanor everyday but I wouldn’t trade a single moment of the life we had together for anything. Happiness is always worth it.”

    Summary
      Inspired by; Bad Dreams by Faouzia {stripped version}~~~~~“How dare you, you foolish mortal—““How dare you!,” Anastasia fired back without even letting her finish her sentence. “It was a vampire who killed my best friend tonight. I didn’t ask for this. Lily didn’t ask for this. The least you can do is have a little compassion after life has effectively pulled the rug, the flooring, and the fucking planet from under both of our feet.”Kamilah scoffed. “It is also a vampire who saved her at a great personal cost, mortal. You will watch your tongue.”“You don’t tell me what to do, vampire. I’m not a child and I’ll do whatever the hell I want, whenever the hell I want.”“What did you just call me?”“If you insist on not using my name, don’t expect me to use yours.”“Do you have a death wish?”“Not necessarily.” Anastasia shrugged. “Casual suicidal tendencies are a generational trait for those of us born in the 90s.”

    Summary
      Inspired by; Born Without A Heart by Faouzia {stripped version}~~~~~Anastasia moved to straddle Kamilah’s lap and hold her properly. The ancient vampire’s grip on her was excruciatingly tight, but she didn't complain — she knew the fact that Kamilah not only felt comfortable crying in front of her, but actually wanted her comfort was a much bigger deal than anyone else would ever be able to understand. They might’ve been in an insanely busy skyscraper in the busiest neighbourhood in Manhattan, with endless cars rumbling past on one side of the specially glazed floor-to-ceiling windows along with a crush of pedestrians, and hoards of well-dressed businessmen and women on the other, but neither of them cared. Kamilah was so frustrated and mentally exhausted that she was shaking violently as she buried her face into the crook of her neck.Kamilah let her hold her in a way she had never allowed anyone else to hold her before. Anastasia let her shake and shudder, and Kamilah truly felt safe in the knowledge that she wouldn’t think less of her for it. Time held no meaning as they existed in each other’s embrace and fed each other with love and togetherness.

    Summary
      Inspired by; Royals by Lorde.~~~~~“You literally do this every holiday,” Lily continued as Kamilah tossed a black Gucci dress that she thought would be perfect for Anastasia to wear to work on top of the pile she was holding. “You bought her Birkins in every jewel tone for the Dark Solstice last year! Hermes had to custom dye the leather three times before you were satisfied—““I’m assuming you have a point.”“Who the hell tells Hermes that their Birkins aren’t good enough?!”“I do.”Lily snorted. “Y’all gonna have to build a new closet for all this stuff.”“Then I’ll employ the best designers money can buy and build my wife a dozen new closets if need be,” she replied absentmindedly as she inspected a Dior handbag, before deeming it unworthy and putting it back on the shelf. “We were thinking of having the penthouse redecorated whilst we are in The Hamptons this summer, anyway— Mathew.”“Yeah?,” Mathew said as he held out her handbag and her coffee like they were some sort of religious offering. “What do you need, boss? Caffeine? Blood? My soul?”“Simmer down, mortal, I shall not be requiring your soul at the present moment.”
