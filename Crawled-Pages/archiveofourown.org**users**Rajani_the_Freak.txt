    Summary
      Reincarnation. Wow. That is real, it seems. Sorry, I'm still a bit in disbelief. I've just recently remembered my whole life before this one. It doesn't help that my eyes are burning for some reason. Now... why the fuck did I get reborn in a world of ninjas that passed off as fiction in my old world? Am I some sort of fucking Mary Sue!?

    Creator Chose Not To Use Archive WarningsColonnello/Lal Mirch the others are to be determined as it goes (this means I'm still open to some input) Ayuzawa Misaki/Uzumaki Naruto in a wayFon (Katekyou Hitman Reborn!) Verde (Katekyou Hitman Reborn!) Lal Mirch Colonnello (Katekyou Hitman Reborn!) Mammon | Viper Skull (Katekyou Hitman Reborn!) Reborn (Katekyou Hitman Reborn!) Luce (Katekyou Hitman Reborn!) Checker Face | Kawahira Fujioka Haruhi Saotome Ranma Sans (Undertale) Ayuzawa Misaki Uzumaki Naruto Harry Potter Teddy Lupin Death (read to see which 'death') (characters will be added)so... you know all those fics of skull-is-harry and so on? yeah - Freeform decided to make it so everyone but Reborn and Luce of the arcobaleno is someone else skull is still harry though this will start to become very AU at some point it is very hard to fit characters from other fandoms seemlessly into an established role but this will be the interesting part anyway ;P If you don't want spoilers for who it who don't read past this tag Ranma is Fon relationship with akane fails (try being in a relationship when you have very determined stalkers) (i DARE you) Coming out about the curse with mom you wouldn't believe who Nodoka Saotome is related to or perhaps you would? Cat Fist actually uses Storm Flames sad but resigned Ranma Sans is Verde How that happen? Science (plus multi-universe time-space shenanigans) Sans is actually forced to work for once I just took away his excuse for laziness and he's not getting it back poor skelly also he doesn't know about chara he thinks that genocide timelines are all frisk's doing he just can't understand why existential crisis (sort of?) Misaki is Lal while studying abroad to become a diplomat she decides to temporarily join the military to learn how to better defend herself (because she doesn't do things by halves) Usui dies (it broke my hear too having to kill him for plot ;_;) she decided to stay in the military after that Naruto is Colonnello He gets slapped with a dimentional travel delayed seal he's in denial over being stuck for a while decided to join the military once he comes to term with it Haruhi is Viper boy if killing Usui broke my heart this one pulverized the remaining bits Haruhi goes to a dark place haruhi also has a daugther Harry is Skull he awakes his flames the DoM wants to study him also someone is gunning for the Elder Wand (guess he shouldn't have openly talked about it in from of a crowd huh) turns out the Hallows do summon Death just... not that universe's Death (if you look at the clues its easy to figure out) (i think) shenanigans will ensue there are three sets of seven when it comes to flames the third one is just too connected to magic for the mafia to learn of them
    Summary
      What if all the arcobaleno but Reborn and Luce are actually people from other fandoms?
What if Fon isn't actually as Chinese and he makes himself to be? What if Verde's greatest successful science experiment was himself? What if Lal Mirch had always been just a nickname and not her real name? What if Colonnello is out of this world... literally? What if Viper's money obsession is just a cover? What if Skull never truly was a civilian)
And most importantly: How will these changes affect the arcobaleno's story?
This is what I came up with.

    Summary
      Things have been weird around Konoha lately. A massive weird chakra explosion just outside the village that had the ANBU teams scrambling for clues, strange big coins made of massive gold show up in pawnshops that the owners didn't remember having bought... (or what happens when you decide to break a powerful magical object with little tought) (PS: I suck at summaries)

No, today you are going to talk to a celebrity robot about and impending attack on the monster ambassador Frisk which you are more than willing to help stop, all because a skeleton that’s going to be there decided to save you’re a month back.

    Summary
      So basically this will be a mix between an AU of Homestuck (in a way) where the extra John on this scene (see page and pester log) accidentally creates a new universe by zapping from place to place and time to time without control of his powers (see this Prologue for more on the subject). In this universe the Sburb and Sgrub games never get used and though the meteors still fall, there are duplicates of the Alpha kids and the Troll race shares the same universe with the humans because of zapping shenanigans. Also, underneath a mountain, monsters exist and, only by rescuing earth like That John did, will they get a chance to come to the surface (decided to use an AU for undertale too, this time Get-rammed's AU of Beastale) This will only show up like halfway through the fic so for now prepare to enjoy only troll and human shenanigans. Also, characters from a fan comic called Madstuck will show up. (see first page here)

    Summary
      Iruka Umino is a beta like the vast majority of Konoha. It makes him a better teacher, a better shinobi, a better friend.Especially when his perpetually-unhormonal alpha friend Kakashi Hatake suddenly returns from a mission, heavily wounded and in heat.So Iruka offers himself to Kakashi as an omega replacement.(As flailinginlove once wrote: A/B/O dynamics but without mpreg, dub-con, and rivers of gushing fluids, also trying to avoid overly stereotyped gender roles.)

    Summary
      Monsters have been a part of human society for nearly two years, and things are balanced between okay and so-so. There's always bound to be resistance to change. Sara was just one human who was willing to work alongside monsters and live a normal life: work, study, and have a social life. But that never makes for an interesting story. It's when she encounters a particular monster that things begin to change for her, and thus her life becomes very...very...interesting.

    Summary
      My name is Isabelle, I'm the last member of the Valentine family, one of the richest in the US, and also known for being the pyromaniacs of the north. A few months ago the monsters got released from mount Ebott, just north of the canadian boarder, and I met a few of them recently. They keep trying to tell me things about SOULs and something called a SOULspark, but it's just not clicking with me. Jeez, I need to smoke another bowl to deal with all this.Please listen to the music I have linked in the notes at the beginning of every chapter (it will make your day happy) ^-^Reader is not main character in this installment. Reader has set forms (see comments on chapter one). Reader transforms between male and female.Grillby/OC

    Summary
      There are 3 sentients in the world. Humans. Monsters. Mythics, or mythological creatures.Humans feared Monsters because they didn't abide by rules. They could not be restrained, commercialized, used as pets, slaves, cash machines.The war happened. Weapons happened. Humans learned the key difference between Monsters and Mythics.Mythics were easier to control.(summary updated 2/19/2016. Don't ask why)
