Obviously there are exceptions and we're getting conflicting and new information about covid-19 all the time but by mid-august, I believe we certainly had observed enough cases for experts to put this together at least.

Like I’m sure people might Not track you down using that information but in 23 years old and I grew up during a time were they made us fear strangers and putting information online.
                                                                        sticky-llama-perfection

Then they went onto asking about ages and personal info. They were never starting the game. They were literally there to get info.I WISH THERE WAS A WAY TO REPORT THIS! ITS A FUCKING GAME! 
                                                                        if-i-had-a-spoon

Not your real name, not your username, not your school, anything. It’s a little different if it’s a private code from somebody, but even then, be smart. If someone is making you uncomfortable by asking those types of questions, leave the server. And if I’m hosting a game and see anyone being a creep like that? You WILL get booted.

Our situation is getting more and more unstable by the day. My best friend has already lost all electronics and any way to reach the world outside  her home. My sister is rapidly approaching the same fate. Our parents are highly homophobic and we are all in in the Lgbtqa+ community, I fear for our safety if we don’t get out soon. My dad has repetitively threatened to shoot my dog, so I don’t feel comfortable leaving her, plus she means the world to me. And he has always made comments about killing/shooting LGBT people. I have no doubt harm will come to us if we don’t get out.But in order to get Them out, I need to be able to be their legal guardian. And to be a legal guardian, I need to be independent. I don’t have a job yet but Im trying to get one, and this is for the apartment. The sooner I get out of here the sooner I can help them out too. I have never done a GoFundMe before, but I’ve seen what these can do. I’ll highly appreciate every donation, Every bit counts. An apartment for the three of us and my dog is around 800 in my area,  I will need around 1600 for the initial payment and around 200 for the  deposit. 250 for gas money and 200 for food. if you can please donate, every cent counts rn. And if you need anymore information my dms are open.,If you cant donate I ask for you to share it.

                                                                        prismatic-bell

Now in practice this law has fallen far short, thank goodness. But if you live in such a place and they start enforcing it, here is how you get around it:Assume everyone who doesn’t speak English is visiting.Never ask about their job, because if they tell you they work here then you know they’re not visiting. You see them a lot for several weeks or months? Hm. Someone in the family must be ill. That’s terribly tough. They always dress in old, ratty laborers’ clothes? I feel you, my dude, I can’t afford new clothes either, and my dad has the fashion sense of an aardvark, so sometimes it’s not even about “affording” them. They say they’ve been here for years? You must have misunderstood. Spanish isn’t your first language, after all. First and last name? It never came up, or you don’t recall–you meet a lot of people.And then, if you’re asked: no, you haven’t seen anyone residing illegally in the United States. Just people visiting.
                                                                        date-a-jew-suggestions
                                                                        Very good very important addition 
                                                                        appropriately-inappropriate
                                                                        Essentially, this is the civil society version of a work-to-rule strike. Don’t do more than is expressly asked of you, and do what you are asked with such an intense attention to protocol that not asking you at all becomes more effective than even bothering. In this case:“Have you seen an illegal immigrant?”“Could you describe an illegal immigrant, officer?”*officer describes a person who is in the country without appropriate paperwork, or who has crossed the border illegally*“No, sir, I haven’t seen any illegal immigrant.” And this is correct. You have NOT seen an illegal immigrant, because you have no way of knowing if Jose Fulano is here legally or not. And since you can’t see his paperwork (or lack thereof), and did not personally see him cross the border illegally, you are only answering precisely the question asked.

From wikipedia:The story depicted a human astronaut, a representative of the Galactic Republic, visiting the planet Cybrinia inhabited by robots. He finds the robots divided into functionally identical orange and blue races, one of which has fewer rights and privileges than the other. The astronaut decides that due to the robots’ bigotry, the Galactic Republic should not admit the planet. In the final panel, he removes his helmet, revealing himself to be a black man.Apparently the Comics Code Authority tried to prevent the author from making the main character black.
                                                                    lakidaa

It took the writer (and the company) threatening the CCA with a lawsuit and telling the guy to fuck off (literally) to get this thing printed: Comic Historian Digby Diehl recounted in Tales from the Crypt: The Official Archives:This really made ‘em go bananas in the Code czar’s office. ‘Judge Murphy was off his nut. He was really out to get us’, recalls [EC editor] Feldstein. ‘I went in there with this story and Murphy says, “It can’t be a Black man”. But … but that’s the whole point of the story!’ Feldstein sputtered. When Murphy continued to insist that the Black man had to go, Feldstein put it on the line. ‘Listen’, he told Murphy, ‘you’ve been riding us and making it impossible to put out anything at all because you guys just want us out of business’. [Feldstein] reported the results of his audience with the czar to Gaines, who was furious [and] immediately picked up the phone and called Murphy. ‘This is ridiculous!’ he bellowed. ‘I’m going to call a press conference on this. You have no grounds, no basis, to do this. I’ll sue you’. Murphy made what he surely thought was a gracious concession. ‘All right. Just take off the beads of sweat’. At that, Gaines and Feldstein both went ballistic. ‘Fuck you!’ they shouted into the telephone in unison. Murphy hung up on them, but the story ran in its original form.[18]
                                                                    lb-lee
                                                                    You know, it’s times like this that I am deeply comforted, knowing that history isn’t just everyone being nice and polite and better than the current generation.  Sometimes it really is just people bellowing swear words over the phone to get shit done.
                                                                    kaylapocalypse

                                                                    a-method-in-it

That is a full year before the Brown v. Board of Education decision, meaning not only was segregation the law of the land, but the process of dismantling it hadn’t even begun. Integration wasn’t even a political topic yet, because there was no integration actually happening, and as far as everyone in 1953 had reason to believe, there wasn’t going to be any any time soon. And yet, in 1953, two white Jewish guys from Brooklyn not only wanted to put out this comic, but were willing to swear at the Comics Code Authority and threaten to hold a press conference – which, by the way, was enough of a threat that the censors did back down; they didn’t laugh and say “Who would care about your press conference?”And, not only that, but in the end they did put out the comic, this comic that at the time all but explicitly said the United States of the day would not be fit to join the Galactic Republic.All of which is pretty damn cool.

Instead, you see him send a small nod in your direction before he leaves the arena. You get his wordless message, of course, and are quick to leave as well.It doesn't take long for you to find him, either, as he's waiting just outside the arena. He seems a lot... calmer than usual right now, but you figure he's just powered out from the battle. When Ike spots you, his face softens just a little. You're always smiling brightly anyways."Ike! Congratulations on your victory! I knew you could do it." Not expecting a response - not that you usually got all that many, anyways - you go on."So, did you maybe have an idea for what you want to do already?"He shakes his head."Really? Because I was thinking," You laugh nervously, suddenly worrying if your idea would seem silly to him. "Um, because there's like, a huge market in town right now, and I've been saving up to go there anyways, so maybe, if it's okay with you-... Would you wanna go there together?""You..." Ike mumbles. "Sure."You had planned this in advance. He feels his chest tighten. "Oh, thank you!" Instinctively, you take his hands in yours. Of course, you are used to touching people - touching him - but that doesn't stop his heart from brutally pounding against his ribcage. He wants to return the gesture - or rather, feel more of you, touch you again, feel your skin, your warmth- But then you pull away again, and he forces his mind to clear up as much as he can get it to.You're quiet for a moment, eyeing him. Your gaze is pleasantly non-invasive, and so Ike finds it suprisingly easy to bear your eyes on him."Oh, before I go... do you want me to take care of your wounds?" Your voice is quiet, conspiratory - It's established knowledge between the two of you that he prefers to avoid the healers - really, he avoids anyone that isn't you, but you don't need to know that much. When you first summoned him, it didn't take you long to notice that he just let all his injuries fester after any given battle, and so it became a routine for him to have you take care of his wounds once he started trusting you to.Ike nods in response to your offer. It wasn't much of a question, really, you just asked out of courtesy - as if he would ever refuse an opportunity to have you touch him, anyways - but once he agrees, you take his hand in yours and lead him to your room. Pushing open the door, you let go of Ike's hand and motion for him to sit down on your bed. He seems even bigger than usual in your tiny, cramped room, and the image makes you chuckle a little.After pulling open your desk's drawers, you take out the small collection of medical supplies you started keeping in your room for Ike.He watches you quietly, your actions barely registering - all he takes in is the small smile on your face, the movement of your eyes as you search for the things you need...He's torn out of his thoughts when you stand in front of him, bandages in hand. "So, where are you hurt?"Wordlessly, Ike pushes his cape to the side, exposing a gash on his upper arm.You nod and then kneel down on the bed beside him, chest turned towards his shoulder. After looking at the wound for a moment, you take a wet cloth and start dabbing around it to clean up the blood. You have long given up on scolding him for just how much he got hurt seeing how it had seemingly no effect on him anyways. Of course, you don't know how excited each injury he got mid-battle could make him, so long as it meant you would take care of him after.When the blood is gone and you can see the injury more clearly, you grab another towel and dampen it with alcohol - you alway have to avoid an infection at all costs, fully aware that you would have no idea how to treat that on your own.Knowing how much it stung to get hand sanitizer into a cut back home, you can't even imagine how this must burn right now. Ike keeps quiet, though, and so you proceed to lift his arm and wrap it in bandages. "Alright," You speak up. "Anywhere else?"Ike lifts his shirt. The first few times you had to treat a wound on his chest or stomach, you were terribly embarassed, but by now, you had adapted a somewhat professional attitude about it, and if anything, you appreciate him trusting you enough in the first place.He has a rather long, but shallow looking cut on his waist, and besides that nothing but a few bruises. As you get to work again, Ike watches you silently. Really, he barely feels the stinging of the alcohol on his open flesh or how it burns when your fingers brush against his bruises - all that matters is that you're touching him.He can't tell how long it takes you to fix him up. All he's able to focus on is you. The feeling of your hands against his stomach, how soft your skin is and how carefully you touch him, how good you smell-"I'm done!"Your voice wakes him from the haze once more."Ah..." Ike clears his throat. As much as he loves you, you're... hard to be around - a constant fight for him to keep it together, restrain himself and whatever it is that has been burning inside of him since the moment he first laid eyes on you. He won't be able to keep that up for much longer, not with you so close to him."Thanks.""No problem!" You smile. "So, we'll meet tomorrow morning, okay? For our date." A laugh escapes your lips. You're joking, of course, it's not actually a date, he knows... and yet the word makes Ike's body heat up anyways."Yes... Tomorrow.""And please go get some rest now, okay? It's been a long day, and I'm sure you're tired."Ike isnt tired, not really, but he knows it's time to leave anyways - his head is still reeling from how close you were to him earlier, and if he doesn't calm down soon, he can't tell what his pounding heart may make him do.—The next day,  Ike arrives to find you already waiting at the gate. For just a moment, he's taken aback by your beauty, the way the morning sun caught let your skin glow even more than usual, how silky it made your hair look, the way the illumination let you look like a deity ascending from the clouds... His chest tightens. "Oh," You spot him. "Good morning! I hope you slept well!"Ike nods absentmindedly, coming closer towards you."So, since the town isn't far from here, I thought we could just walk there! I hope that's okay with you?""Yeah." "Alright!" You take his hand again. Whatever part of him that still holds on to some remains of his sanity wants to pull away, fight for control over his urges - but, like some kind of bad omen, that part gets drowned out by absolutely everything else in his head and so his hand only tightens around yours.The town really isn't far from the castle, and so after a little walk you've already arrived. You want to run off immediately and take a look at all the merchant's booths and goods, but you wouldn't want to leave Ike alone amidst the crowd, and so your hand remains in his and you gently tug him along.The hours pass with you constantly showing Ike whatever catches your attention. He doesn't pay any of the items much mind, but the image of you excitedly staring at all the items and stalls in the market is enough to make this day worth it for him.As the day moves along, the two of you have lunch in a tavern in town before taking one last stroll through the market.Remembering a pendant you saw at a stall earlier today than you thought about getting for Ike but hadn't been able to with him constantly beside you, you stop walking and turn to him."Um... There's something I still want to buy. But it's... a suprise, so you have to wait for me while I get it, okay?" You smile, excited at the prospect of getting to get a gift for your friend. Ike nods and lets go of your hand - but of course he has no intention of letting you walk through the darkening town's streets on your own. As soon as you're out of his sight - meaning there's enough distance for you not to spot him, as well - he starts to follow your steps. You don't walk for long, the booth you seem to be aiming for not far from where you'd left him. Ike watches as you talk to the merchant and pick something up from their table before dropping a few gold coins into their hand. As you stuff it into your pocket, Ike catches a glimpse of the item you bought - it looks like some kind of brooch, perhaps, a dark blue stone held by ornamental flames around it.As you turn around to return to Ike, unaware that he's hiding around the corner - by now, the streets were empty and there was no crowd for him to hide in - someone stops you.Ike can't hear what they're saying, but he feels his blood begin to boil. How dare they try and talk to you? He was waiting for you. They were wasting your time.He watches as you respond to the man in front of you, clearly looking to get away. You smile awkwardly before turning and walking away again, much faster this time. The man doesn't allow you to get far, however, as he quickly catches up and grasps your wrist. You freeze, clearly scared and uncomfortable.You want to get away, but there's no saying what he might do if you shake him off."Let go of me, please-..." You're quiet, scared to speak at all. Maybe Ike would notice you taking too long and come to look for you? You weren't even armed right now. If the man decided to hurt you...He lets go of your wrist, only to firmly place his hands on your shoulders and push you into an alley, against the wall. His breath smells of alcohol. Maybe that gives you an advantage, you think.In your panicked state, you don't hear the fast, heavy footsteps approaching - the moment he saw the man touch you, Ike took off in your direction. He doesn't- can't think straight as his surroundings become foggy, the only thing remaining clear in his head being you. He has no idea how long the street is, how long it takes him until he reaches you. Everything is blurry around him, and nothing in his vision seems clear or important until he sees you, pressed into a wall and still anxiously fighting against the man's advances. He doesn't have time to think before his sword is lodged inside the man's back. As he falls, Ike can see your bloodstained form in front of him. His vision seems to clear, foggy, burning gaze growing conscious again as his eyes settle on your face.You stare blankly for a moment, bringing your hand up to feel the warm liquid splattered across your face. Then, the shock begins to set in. Tears start streaming down your face, and your desperate attempts to wipe them off only end up in your shaking hands spreading the blood across your face. You stare at the corpse lying at your feet, chest rising and sinking rapidly as you take in panicked, shallow breaths.Ike wordlessly sheathes his sword again.Before Ike can think to say anything, you've already taken his hand."Follow me!" You order. An unexpected reaction.You pull him along, away from the town and towards the woods nearby. He can tell that you're shaking, but it's clear you aren't giving yourself time for any feelings right now. You're acting the way you do on the battlefield - logical and clear, obviously figuring out how to get you two out if this situation.When you enter the woods, you pull him along further. The sun is sinking as it is, and the trees only darken your surroundings further.It isn't until you reach a small stream expanding into a pond that you halt your steps.You sink to your knees, quickly shrugging off your coat and holding it into the water. You're still shaking."Come here, please." Your voice is quiet and hoarse, much less cheerful than usual. Something is wrong with you.Ike kneels down beside you, and only then he can see the tears still running down your face, mixing with the blood and staining your skin all the way to your neck. Your chest is heaving and your arms are shaking so hard he has to wonder how you're even able to control them at all.You look... beautiful, like this. How is it that you didn't seem to be mad or disturbed at all? Your first instinct was to get you two out of there, to protect him. Ike feels his chest tighten again. He wants to touch you. What an intimate moment to share, sitting beside you as you wash the blood of a man he killed for you out of your coat. Perhaps you see it that way as well?"...Why?" Now he can hear that you're crying."Why did you- We weren't on the battlefield, he wasn't even-..." You sob."I did it for you." "What?*" Your voice breaks, chest heaving heavily."I was protecting you.""No-.." For a moment, nothing but your sobs fills the air. "You can't do that! I-... I don't want people to die because of me! Why? Why did you have to...?" Ike reaches out to touch your shoulder. Your warmth comforts him, clears his head, but you tense up so much that you can barely move anymore."Because I love you."You look at him in shock."Wh-what?""I love you." He repeats.Your mind is racing. He loves you. He loves you. Why? If he did this for your sake, is he really to blame? Would it be right to be upset? You know the battle he's fighting. You can see it in his burning red eyes, in the purple mist always enveloping his form, in the way his gaze fogs up completely whenever he fights and how his head never seems clear at all unless he's... around you. Of course. You could- No, should have known. You knew he was struggling, you knew he was full of rage and grief and loss and fear and rage. You should've helped him earlier. This wasn't his fault. He couldn't control it. You couldn't blame him. In the grand scheme of things, that wasn't the first man that died for you, was it? Had you not watched countless soldiers die on the battlefield, killed by your allies, for your sake? How was this any different?"I'm sorry..." You whisper.Ike wants to say you have nothing to be sorry for, the only one who was at fault tonight was that fool who decided to corner and harass you - but maybe it wouldn't be too bad to have you feel indebted to him in some way or another. Maybe this would make it easier to swallow for you.You let go of your coat, still stained with blood, and bring your hands up to your face to wipe away tge blood and the tears. "I'm sorry." You repeat, reaching out to him.Gently, your hands cup his face, and Ike instinctively grabs your wrists. His grip is tight, mind still burning from seeing you be harassed earlier. You let him touch you."I'm sorry." Again.Ike's chest is painfully tight. His lungs are burning, his heart is beating rapidly against his ribcage. It's pounding so worryingly hard he has to wonder how you aren't hearing it."Thank you-" Your voice breaks again. "Thank you for protecting me." You speak through the sobs. You sound like you've given up, while the feeling of the fire inside of him finally calming down makes it clear that he just won.Ike lets go of your wrists to tangle one of his hands in your hair, the other moving around to press into the back of your neck. You stumble fowards, towards him, and have to hold onto his shoulders to steady yourself. His face is close to yours now, so close you can feel his breath. Before you can say anything, he leans in and presses his lips against yours. You tense up and hold your breath, fingers nervously digging into his shoulders. The kiss tastes of sweat and blood, and you don't want to wonder who's lips are carrying which taste. When he pulls away, you're both panting.You don't know what to say, so you just stare at him quietly. What is there to say, anyways? You lean back a little and look up into the night sky. Behind you, your coat is laying in the grass. It's still stained, sadly. Blood is painfully hard to wash out.——————————————————————notes: oh my god this was SO hard to write!! bcus of a lot of factors tbh!! like the fact that i had a lot of ideas for this, the fact that its a bunch of action-descriptions which i suck at and that its like 3k words and mainly also that this is basically for a friend of mine who really likes ike so i ABSOLUTELY want this to be as good as it can possibly be!! oh also the title feuertaufe is german for baptism of fire!! i used the german word cus the translation sounds really clunky imo!!u CANNOT imagine how nervous i am to post this dude full on flapping my hands and everything rn.... aaaa i rly hope ppl like this &lt;33
