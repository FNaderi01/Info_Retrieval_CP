                 Mini Bio
                "All the artists are copying their fans, darling."Fan Riot is a project by Owen G. Parry with contributing artists and fans. It includes original research, public events and performances, and the development of a new stage show for theatre and concert venues in 2015.Fan Riot explores the phenomenon of fandom at a time when distinctions between the professional and amateur, the artist and fan are diminishing. Fans who self-publish emotionally driven, cross-form, elaborate fan works now have the tools and abilities to upstage those cultural figures around whom they rally. But would such a move only be at the cost of their own existence? Fan Riot contemplates the ways artist and fans are negotiating these cultural shifts, and making way for new, unusual and imaginative forms of creativity and collectivity.Twitter _fanriotFan Riot is supported by Arts Council England.
