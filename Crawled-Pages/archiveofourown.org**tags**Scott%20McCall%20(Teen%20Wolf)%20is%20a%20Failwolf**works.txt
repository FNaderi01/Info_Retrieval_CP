    Summary
      Stiles is bitten by a rogue alpha whilst out patrolling alone as Scott has bailed on him. Somehow, something has gone wrong with the bite and Stiles isn’t reacting in the normal manner. Frightened and alone, he runs and hides from the Pack.
Will anyone within the Pack be able to find him and help him regain control of himself?

    Summary
      Stiles growls as he pushes Scott: “You need to tell me where Peter is right now so I can clean up this mess you have made. And no games Scott. I don’t have time for them right now.”
Scott looks like he wants to be anywhere else than right before fuming Stiles. Good, Stiles wants him scared and desperate. Stiles has always known Scott doesn’t like Peter but to sacrifice a pack member like that is unforgivable. Peter has been good ever since he came back from the dead. Stiles has made sure of it.

    Summary
      He’d been trying unsuccessfully to track down Malia and Lydia before he had to meet Scott, and then the Jeep hadn’t wanted to start again, and he just hoped that the goddamn rain wasn’t a further metaphor for this fucked up day, because he was already past his limit.       Scott came out of the clinic and Stiles didn’t know how he always looked so pulled together and calm with everything that was going on. It was one of life’s real mysteries, way beyond werewolves and the murder doctors.        “Hey, he said to his best friend, “sorry I couldn’t get the jeep to start again. It’s barely holding on and I couldn’t get ahold of Malia or Lydia.” His voice trailed off as Scott stepped into the light, and there was a look in Scott’s face, something he’d never seen there before.                “Scott?” He said, though what exactly he was questioning he wasn’t sure, but the look left him unsettled and on edge.        Scott didn’t say anything, he just tilted his head up slightly and raised his hand, a gleam of something catching Stiles’s eye before he could see that it was a familiar wrench.

    Summary
      Peter pushed Stiles out of the warehouse, with all intentions of following right behind him. That was not going to happen however when a bullet pierced his leg. And another one goes through his side. 
He could hear Stiles screaming his name but it was all too much as the hunters surrounded him. Only him. The last member of the pack still inside the warehouse.

    Summary
      Stiles can’t take it anymore. It has been going on for weeks, months even if he is totally honest with himself. He can’t take the nightmares. He can’t take the looks the pack gives him every time they see him. 
The pity in their eyes. 
Or hatred, depending on a person.

    Summary
      It's been 8 years since the McCall Pack decided that Stiles wasn't strong enough to run with wolves - that he was just a useless little human whose body was too fragile and mind was too weak. It's been 8 years since Stiles packed up what little he deemed worthy and disappeared. When John Stilinski is injured in a battle against the newest supernatural entities threatening Beacon Hills, Stiles comes back to town accompanied by new friends and an entirely new life. Forgotten wounds are reopened. New family meets old friends. Now fighting against threats closer to the heart than ever before, Stiles and the McCall pack have to fight together once more. Now, who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?

    Summary
      Derek has had enough.Stiles and Scott, whoever they meant to be to him, were hiding something, lying to him—more than they had already lied to him.Hadn’t his so-called older-self—and he still wants to cry bullshit, still wants to insist that this is some fucked up nightmare or some cruel joke, that his family weren’t dead, that his house wasn’t just wood and ashes—ever tell them that it was impossible to lie to a werewolf?So, the moment he is alone with Stiles, away from Agent McCall—and what type of Alpha leaves a human packmate with a foreign wolf?—he moves, slamming him against the door.He’s going to demand answers, a growl a few threats Uncle Peter had taught him and the added growl that he practised with Laura, that Derek made a mistake—he breathed in.

    Summary
      Theo Raeken’s world hasn’t changed. Thoughts of the Dread Doctors and Tara still filled his mind, he was still homeless, and he was still hated by the pack. Well, most of the pack, at least. There was one thing in Theo’s world that had changed- Liam Dunbar. His  relationship with the blue-eyed beta was different. It took up most of Theo’s headspace. How could it be different in a world that hasn’t changed? But in Theo’s effort to find out about Liam, he slowly figures out parts of himself he could never have imagined to exist. He realizes, it’s not the world that changed, but rather himself.

    Summary
      “I am the alpha”, Scott growls, eyes flashing red as he stares at Peter trying to act intimidating but failing miserably.
Stiles scoffs silently as he watches the power fight between the two. He knows how the blot of this will go. Scott will act all mighty true alpha he is, refusing to listen to Peter’s advice and later, a day or two later blame the man for everything he has done. It is always the same and quite frankly Stiles is getting tired of it.

    Summary
      Derek Hale is confused by Stiles Stilinski, or at least Derek's sexuality is confused. He knows that Stiles feels some kind of way toward him, but a discovery on Stiles' laptop leaves no question to HOW much Stiles likes him. 
This would be fine, if they weren't also fighting Big Bads, Bad Alphas, and age of consent laws. Add to it the pressures of learning magic, graduations, and a Sheriff for a potential father in law, things just aren't going to be easy.
But they'll definitely be worth it.

    Summary
      Cut off from the pack, Stiles remembers one very important thing. He doesn’t need anyone. Not since his mother branded him as devil. Not since his father, struggling with the death of his beloved and a hyperactive kid who asked all the wrong questions, found comfort in the bottom of a bottle. Truth is, he’s been alone longer than he’s had someone. And if the latest imposed solitude has been good for one thing, it’s that he’s finally remembered this. That Stiles has lived in the grey since his father handed him a gun and his mother showed him how to shoot. That despite recent events, he is strong, has been shaped and moulded by the cruelty and hardship of carrying the Gajos line. So, when pack loyalties vanish, he does what he was taught. He disappears.
