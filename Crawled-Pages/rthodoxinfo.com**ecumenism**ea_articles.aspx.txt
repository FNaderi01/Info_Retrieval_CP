Ecumenism Awareness: General Articles on Ecumenism
	Introductions and Overviews
        Ecumenism: by Metropolitan Vitaly; presented
        to the Sobor of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia. This is
        not just another diatribe against ecumenism. Met. Vitaly offers a very
        unique and historically-based perspective that is highly worth reading.
			"The attempt to align the Orthodox Church with such a movement does not benefit
				the Orthodox in any way. With the disdain that the 'Orthodox' Ecumenists
				show for Tradition and the very provocative manner in which they trample
				on the sacred Canons, they scandalize the Orthodox people and cast many
				down into the abyss of unbelief and perdition." 
			Orthodox Tradition and Modernism (Etna, CA: The Center for Traditionalist
				Orthodox Studies, 1992), p. 34.
	 The Missionary Origins of Modern Ecumenism: Milestones Leading up to 1920, by Fr. Peter Heers. A talk delivered at the Academic Conference "The Mission of the Orthodox Church and The World Council of Churches", Athens, May 15, 2005.

        A Sorrowful Epistle: (1969), the first of three
        by Metropolitan PHILARET of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia
        (a.k.a. the ROCA). This is especially helpful for tracing the historical
        development of the Ecumenical movement. Fr. Alexander Schmemann, in his
        1970 reply to this epistle, called it a "perfectly canonical and
        traditional stand."
        The Price of Ecumenism: How Ecumenism
        Has Hurt the Orthodox Church, by Fr. John Reeves, an OCA priest. A clarion
        call to Orthodox about the dangers inherent in mid-1990's Ecumenism as
        expressed by the WCC and the NCC. Fr. John Reeves writes how it is a shock
        to see how the original Protestant Christian emphasis on traditional Trinitarian
        theology has devolved into a catch-all of current trends in earth-goddess,
        great spirits, non-Trinitarian, undoctrinal, eclectically mixed "liturgical"
        communion services that evidently mean something different to each participant.
        Behind his gentle and restrained presentation of degrading incidents toward
        Orthodox clergy, one senses a heartfelt call that Orthodox clergy should
        withdraw completely and at once from these organizations that have given
        up all pretense of being Christian. Fr. John also gave a similar 
        version of this article as a talk at the 2004 conference in Thessaloniki entitled Ecumenism: Origins, 
        Expectations and Disenchantment.
        The Orthodox Church and
        the Ecumenical Movement: this article first appeared in the November 1996 edition of "Diocesan
        News For Clergy and Laity" (Volume 4, Number 11), printed and distributed
        by the Greek Orthodox Diocese of Denver. As you can see, there are many
        in the GOA who take issue with ecumenism and the Balamand Agreement, though
        the latter is defended on the official GOA website (see Balamand section).

        scholarly treatise outlining the historical road of Constantinople's fall
        to the heresy of ecumenism.
        BEM and Orthodox Spirituality: by [Arch]bishop
        Chrysostomos. This is one of the most important articles about ecumenical
        issues and orientation that I have ever read. He clearly and patristically
        lays the foundation for true ecumenical outreach and argues that
        first and foremost this outreach must be grounded in an authentic
        Orthodox self-awareness. It is a must-read for anyone interested
        in the problem of ecumenism.

        work that is related to the ecumenistic spirit of our age and the true

           "A result of [modernism] is the confusion and disturbance which exist among 
            the Orthodox, the disregard and disdain for Tradition on the part 
            of many, and the projection of mistaken, dangerous and subversive 
            views. It is urgent, then, that this topic be studied very attentively. 
            Only when this happens, and the correct answers are given and 
            passed on, will it be possible for mutual understanding, unanimity 
            and peace to come about among the Orthodox, and for the great danger, 
            which Orthodoxy faces today from all kinds of plotters against her, 
            to be put off."

	The Official Conclusions of the September, 2004 conference "Ecumenism: Origins, Expectations, 
		Disenchantment", sponsored by the School of Pastoral Theology, The Aristotelian University, Thessaloniki, Greece. Among the concluding proposals of the conference 
		participants we read:
		 "That it be made manifest to church leaders everywhere that, in the event that 
		they continue to participate in, and lend support to, the pan-heresy of 
		Ecumenism - both inter-christian and inter-religious - the obligatory salvific, 
		canonical and patristic course for the faithful, clergy and laity, is 
		excommunication: in other words, ceasing to commemorate bishops, who are 
		co-responsible for, and co-communicants with, heresy and delusion. This is not a 
		recourse to schism but rather to a God-pleasing confession, just as the ancient 
		Fathers, and bishop-confessors in our own day have done, such as the esteemed 
		and respected former Metropolitan of Florina, Augustinos, and the Fathers of the 
		Holy Mountain (Athos)."
