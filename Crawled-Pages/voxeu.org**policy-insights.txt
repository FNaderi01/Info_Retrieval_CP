Policy Insights
CEPR launched its Policy Insight series in 2007 and since then over 100 have been published. Policy Insights are tightly argued policy essays aimed at economists working in governments, international organizations, the private sector, academics and the media. The series encourages serious researchers to participate in the policy debate by reflecting on the policy implications that flow from their research, the research they read, and their general understanding of the world.
