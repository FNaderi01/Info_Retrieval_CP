Brand formula[edit]
Formula Holden? Toyota Racing Series? --Falcadore (talk) 20:26, 23 April 2009 (UTC)
or NASCAR or V8 Supercar? --Falcadore (talk) 16:36, 2 May 2009 (UTC)
Or IndyCar?  And 'Brand Formula' seems like an unnecessary distinction.Kenhullett (talk) 14:16, 25 July 2009 (UTC)
Series - car categories/cars[edit]
I think directing to the series should be 2nd nature to articles about the cars/categories, why, this template should be about class of race cars more than class of race series.
But you need to bear in mind that not all race series are notable enough to have an article written specifically about their car. It makes more sense to link to the series page itself, which I feel is what people would actually want to be reading about, and if they would like to find more imformation about the car itself, they can follow a link from the main page itself.

What goes where[edit]
If you are splitting "One-make formula" from other series, you need to decide whether you mean make of car or make of engine.  Formula Super Vee had a spec engine but the cars were built by different manufacturers.  In that respect it's the same as Formula Vee but you have Formula Vee in with F1, F2 and F3.  (Why is the link to Formula Vee called "Formula First"?  That's just a regional name for FV.)
Formula Challenge Japan is definitely a one-make formula; as is International Formula Master.  Formula Ford (incl. FF1600 and FF2000) used a spec engine but cars from multiple manufacturers so they should move in with F1.
A split makes sense but maybe the split should be between spec formulae (where engine and chassis are fixed) and non-spec formulae (where any chassis and engine can be used as long as it meets the defined specification).
The order seems a bit odd in places.  It's partly alphabetical, partly grouped and partly order by position on the hypothetical "ladder".  Has this been the results of great debate or is it up for grabs? Allen Brown (talk) 09:30, 9 August 2010 (UTC)
I totally agree that categories such as Formula Ford should not be classified as "One-make formulae". GTHO (talk) 10:13, 2 June 2011 (UTC)
Touring car racing[edit]
Should Scandinavian Touring Car Championship (STCC) be included here? Oskar Liljeblad (talk) 17:02, 2 November 2012 (UTC)
I realize now that there are too many of them listen on Touring_car_racing#Series_of_competition... Oskar Liljeblad (talk) 17:04, 2 November 2012 (UTC)
To answer your original question, the answer would be no. This is a template listing classes, for example Next Generation Touring Car, not the series they compete in. --Falcadore (talk) 17:19, 2 November 2012 (UTC)
Where does Super GT's GT500/GT300 goes then? 110.20.158.200 (talk) 07:36, 10 January 2016 (UTC)
See "Grand Touring". Donnie Park (talk) 11:45, 2 June 2016 (UTC)
