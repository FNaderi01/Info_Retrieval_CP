My friend Phil who works in the Computers department at Best Buy once said he gets happy whenever we work the same shift because he knows he'll laugh at least once that day. I mean, it doesn't take too much to make Phil laugh. But it was one of the better compliments I've gotten at work or anywhere.I've bought more presents for myself than for anyone else this Christmas, including this. I don't feel bad about it either.
