    Summary
      Connor would like to get through the shittiest time of the year without a fight, a mistake, and a cute boy with a cast on his arm getting in his way. Michael just wants things with his best friend to get back to normal, regardless of unrequited feelings. Zoe isn’t even sure why Alana Beck is dead set on making her life a living hell right now or why it’s getting so under her skin. Jake has fully realized that being strong enough to protect the one person he cares about means falling into a mess himself. And Evan is really just hoping Connor can see he’s not scared of him after all. One season, six interlocking stories, and the very hard to deny proof that love is actually all around.

    Summary
      Thirteen is too young to gain eight years of memories that might come to pass--especially when you don't even know what to do with yourself in the present. But when the future is that bloody and dark, do you have any choice but to try to change it?  He remembers the absolute agony of the doctors trying to save him, which finally sent him into blissful unconsciousness—  —except he doesn’t remember any of that. Tsuna’s last memory is of putting his head down on his desk and falling asleep to the sound of the teacher’s droning, thirteen years old and tired of not understanding a word, not of being twenty-two and beloved and dying.
