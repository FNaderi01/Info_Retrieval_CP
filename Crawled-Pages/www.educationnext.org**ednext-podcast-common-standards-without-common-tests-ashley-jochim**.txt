EdNext Podcast · Ep. 46 – Aug. 3, 2016: Common Standards without Common Tests
			The Common Core standards initiative was launched in 2009 but by the time new tests aligned with those standards were rolled out 4 to 5 years later, there was mounting opposition to using those tests to evaluate teachers and schools. To preserve support for the standards, many states began throwing the assessments overboard. Will abandoning the tests in order to save the standards actually work? How will teachers and parents react to new state tests, and what will happen when these new tests are used for accountability purposes?
In this podcast, EdNext’s Marty West talks with Ashley Jochim of the Center for Reinventing Public Education, who is the co-author of “The Politics of the Common Core Assessments: Why states are quitting the PARCC and Smarter Balanced testing consortia.”
The EdNext Podcast is available on iTunes, Google Play, Soundcloud, Stitcher and here every Wednesday.
