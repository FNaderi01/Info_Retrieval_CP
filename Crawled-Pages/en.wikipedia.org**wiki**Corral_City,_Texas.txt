History[edit]
A woman named Geneva Helton and her husband decided to form an incorporated municipality to get around Denton County's liquor laws. The Heltons bought over 20 acres (8.1 ha) of land from a family friend. The two then installed a sewer system and established a liquor store. Corral City incorporated in 1973. Afterwards doublewide trailers and recreational vehicles appeared in the city limits. Candace Carlisle of the Denton Record-Chronicle said that Corral City "prospered" for a decade, but after the early 1990s retirement of Geneva Helton's and the death of her husband, the town, in Carlisle's words, "began a slow decline. Soon, all that remained was a graveyard of rotting doublewides."[10]
According to Carlisle, by 1993 "Corral City looked in every way like a vanquished 'ghost town'." James "Eddie" Draper became the mayor and owner of Corral City. Carlise said that to Draper "it was a boomtown waiting to happen."
In October 2016, Corral City was renamed to Draper, Texas in honor of  former mayor James "Eddie" Draper.[1]
Cityscape[edit]
Draper is located halfway between Denton and Fort Worth. It is in proximity to Interstate 35W and Farm to Market Road 407. Most residents of Draper live in mobile homes; in mobile home parks, permanent structures are not allowed to be built.[10]
Culture[edit]
In 2008 Candace Carlisle of the Denton Record-Chronicle said, "In Corral City, neighbors share their homes and their lives with each other. They keep their RV doors open at all hours to celebrate the good times and mourn the hard times with their neighbors."[10]
Education[edit]
The Draper area is located the Northwest Independent School District.[11][12] Residents are zoned to Justin Elementary School,[13] Medlin Middle School,[14] and Byron Nelson High School.[15][16] Before 2010 residents were zoned to Pike Middle School.[17]
