    Summary
      Shoyo and his family leave for summer break. They planned on moving to Europe, but as the second semester of school starts, Shoyo falls ill, extremely ill. So the family of 3 packs their bags and head back to Japan. Shoyo didn't want to go back to Karasuno, so his mother enrolls him in Aoba Jousai High School. He knows what he's getting into when he goes there but anything is better than facing his old teammates.

    Summary
      “I see that we’re still in love” Kei says with dry humor. He's sitting in the bed with his glasses on and a book resting on his lap. “Very convincing.” Once again, Kuroo wonders why he isn't sensing anything a little more antagonistic from him. “We need to talk,” Kuroo says abruptly and Kei closes his book. Kuroo takes a deep breath before blurting out his wish. “I want a divorce.”

    Summary
      Hinata Shouyou is good at acting, good at being a big brother, and good at being a mother in the absence of an actual, functioning mother.Or, although Shouyou might have hair and a personality the same as fire, all fires burn out.
