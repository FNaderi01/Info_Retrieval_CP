      Alternate Universes Collapse

          Summary:
              So basically this will be a mix between an AU of Homestuck (in a way) where the extra John on this scene (see page and pester log) accidentally creates a new universe by zapping from place to place and time to time without control of his powers (see this Prologue for more on the subject). In this universe the Sburb and Sgrub games never get used and though the meteors still fall, there are duplicates of the Alpha kids and the Troll race shares the same universe with the humans because of zapping shenanigans. Also, underneath a mountain, monsters exist and, only by rescuing earth like That John did, will they get a chance to come to the surface (decided to use an AU for undertale too, this time Get-rammed's AU of Beastale) This will only show up like halfway through the fic so for now prepare to enjoy only troll and human shenanigans. Also, characters from a fan comic called Madstuck will show up. (see first page here)
  Notes:
      AUTHOR NOTES MOTHA FUCKAS!: 
It's going to be a slavetale/petstuck/slavestuck AU. While it wont be all darkness and hopelessness (really, i don't think I'm capable of a completely dark or majorly dark story) there will be moments where said darkness with rear it's head. People will suffer. People will have bad things happen to them, maybe even horrible things. People will die (you can vote on it but I have some I want to survive and some I'm going to kill so those wont be counted on the votes, but everyone else I haven't decided on is fair game so vote away). It won't happen very often, but it will happen.
As for pairings: OC/ElizaxSans for sure. Jake and Dirk because they belong together. Same with Alphys/Undyne and Rose/Kanaya. Marisa/Lynxis was always going to be a thing in Madstuck so, it'll remain so here as well. 
As for the others... well... Regular!JohnxRoxy will probably be a thing since I do like the pairing. 
I am considering KarkatxJade because canon Karkat and Dave got their chance at being together but JadeXKarket got punted to the side before it even starting (dude was trying to confess to her when she got killed by explosive shaving cream for Christs sake! And I pronounced sake as the Japanese alcoholic beverage  because at the time I was a big shipper of the thing but it never happened unlike almost every other ship. Even ghost!Nep gets to date a ghost!Karkat, according to some vague words pronounced by a sprite of a two-named cat. I'll admit, though, I'm not as big of a shipper of the pairing as I used to be, so if there's enough opposition, I'm might not do it. 
Feel free to suggest other pairings, though.
There will be a chapter count at the end notes so feel free to visit there to read it. Also, there'll be a thing I like to call 'half-chapters) which will be a sort of interlude to other characters that aren't a part of the main story, and it'll even have flashbacks thrown in between.
    (See the end of the work for more notes.)
      Chapter 1: ACT 1: Trolltale// Prologue – β(beta) Timeline
    Chapter Text
ACT 1: Trolltale
    Prologue – β Timeline
Once there was one main timeline named α timeline and every other timeline that deviated from that one was a doomed timeline. Doomed, because it was destined to fall into oblivion. No timeline was supposed to exist aside from the α. And then a glitch happened.An anomaly with enough power to alter the α timeline at will, breaking fate to suit itself. That Anomaly could alter its own fate and meet itself making other versions of itself irrelevant. One of those irrelevant versions, still unable to control its own power, jumped across time, altering the timeline in such a way that it caused a break.
Usually the α timeline was associated with a game. Its name varies across people. In some it was called Sburb, in others Sgrub, but it was always linked to the α timeline. It was the sole reason the timelines even existed.  What distinguished the α timeline from the doomed ones was the rate of survivals. The α timeline was always the one with more survivals. Those were the two main attributes to the α timeline.
But the Anomaly changed that. It brought someone to a time where they weren’t supposed to exist. It teleported planets, whole solar systems even, across the void to places where before there was nothing. All the changes it caused saved several lives, many more than any α timeline ever had before… but it disconnected that timeline from the game completely and that caused a paradox.
It saved more lives than any other timeline so it should become the new α timeline. It wasn’t associated with the game so it couldn’t become an α timeline. If the lives saved had been an extra few lives it would have been a no brainer for whatever entity that could choose to elect the α timeline but when the lives saved amounted to two whole planets, an entire universe, even, the two conditions were definitely at war.
It eventually settled by creating a whole other timeline apart from the α, one that wasn’t doomed. It could even be called another universe altogether. That was when the β timeline was created. Because of all the irregularities due to the glitch the Time factor on that timeline was twisted, another anomaly created. And even another one stronger than the second.
And the first anomaly, finally able to control their power somewhat, finally stopped altering reality and the new timeline finally settled down, always and forever apart from the other one.
