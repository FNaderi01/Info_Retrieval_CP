Your body collapsed beneath him in a disheveled heap as the insufferable appetite of your lover abused your dwindling remains. Every thrust had made your shoulders wrack with the onslaught of sobs that stained your pillow.  You feel Seokjin pulse inside you as the warmth bursts inside your gut. That’s when his personality flips. He can be so rough with you one second and then retreat back into the man you fell in love with in no time.Seokjin’s hand pats down your hair, lips pressing to your heated skin as you try to come down from your orgasm. Your mouth agape continues drooling pathetically onto the pillow your cheek rests on, unable to phantom the little death he inflicted on you. All the while, your heat is still harshly clenching around him as his words drone out any other sound. “Did Daddy make you feel all warm inside,“ Seokjin asks, the proud grin on his face could be heard through his tone. You mewl your response, unsteady hand reaching back blindly to find the one brushing through your hair. He fucked you so roughly yet actively made sure you felt adored and cherished afterward. "You made Daddy feel so good, princess,” Seokjin’s hand slips through your fingers, brushing his lips against the backs of your knuckles, “it’s okay. Daddy’s going to keep you safe”一Yoongi “You’re so fucking good,” Yoongi groans, feeling the warm suction of your mouth sucking him in as your mouth moves off his shaft. Tongue swirling around the tip of his cock, you swear you see his eyes rolling back as you give him your all. “No one gives head like you,” he swears, hands trying to find purchase at the arms of the chair to prevent himself from yanking your hair like a catfight. Yoongi has busted his ass for too long to get his hands on you. He’s tried every way possible to get closer to you, working up to this moment in his mind for so long and building it into something unrealistic. This was better than anything he fantasized about when jerking off. “I love you so fucking much,” Yoongi grunts, chest starting to heave as he nears his high. It feels so much better like this when he has officially made you his with a diamond ring on your finger to prove it. You’re the fucking prude that made him wait for it, but it’s so good that he would wait all over again to feel your throat constricting around his dick. You squeeze your eyes shut as you feel the warm spurts of cum onto your face. Yoongi grunts out curses above you, managing to squeeze in a ‘good fucking girl’ in between his near incoherent mutters. That’s when you feel it run down your chin, neck, and stains your wedding dress. 一Hoseok Mechanical whirring and clicking noise sounded out from the black rectangle, resting heavily in Hoseok’s hand. The frame of the image capturing the way your body moves from the force of his cock drilling inside you. Your body travels it’s way up the bed with every needlessly unmerciful blow to your pelvis, but the frame doesn’t show the way your hands push against the headboard to prevent you from banging your head.“You like that, huh,” Hoseok questions, tone as condescending as usual. All you do is mewl out your response, a cry that doesn’t take much longer for Hoseok to mock with faux praise. “Oh, darling,” he says, “you deserve this. You deserve to feel so good that you’re fucking braindead.” Hoseok’s voice alone fucks you up in ways that no other man has. It’s gruff yet at the same time fails to convey anything besides mockery, and in times like this, it’s gravelly calmness only submerges you further into the pleasure stimulated by his touch. His voice makes sure that all your senses are drowning from his intent. You watch as Hoseok leans in closer, moving the camera to capture both of your faces as his big hand holds your jaw open. His pointer finger presses down on your tongue as he spits down your throat. “Swallow it,” he orders, palm pressing under your chin to hold your mouth shut, “that’s my girl.” 一NamjoonTo Namjoon, there’s nothing more pleasing than watching his angel obeying his orders. No matter what the command may be, it gives him a boost of authority and control. Namjoon has always had a strict set of rules in place for you. From the beginning of your relationship, you had caught on to his unaddressed discipline and reward system. As your relationship progressed, the discipline and reward system shifted into straight out law and order. You indulged in this discipline and reward system quite often, seeking out different ways to do good that would grant you the opportunity for praise. Your hands cup his cheeks, keeping Namjoon steady as you place frenzied and despairing kisses all over his face when he comes home from work. The eagerness you show to please him is on the verge of annoying, but the tender brush of his lips along your neck calms you. A soft chuckle strays from his lips, lulling you into his arms. “My girl missed me, huh,” Namjoon muses, letting you wrap your legs around his waist as he walks with you to sit in his chair. Eyes brightening from the most simplistic form of possession he used, you couldn’t help giggling proudly at your title. “You’re so patient. It must be so hard to wait for Daddy all day,” Namjoon murmurs, brushing your hair over your shoulders, “well, now that I’m home, Daddy can show you how much he missed you.”一Jimin Your hips jolted and squirmed as you attempted to sit still on the hardwood floor until you heard the clicking of Jimin’s tongue and snap of his fingers to signal you to come closer. Hands and knees moving you across the room, the pathetic quivering of your lower body never stops. The light buzz of the vibrator stuffed inside you fills the room with a faint hum. A high-pitched mewl escapes your lips now and then, but that’s part of the fun in Jimin’s eyes. Jimin watches from his chair as you kneel in front of him. He had lost focus of the work on his desk and needed a break, so what better thing to entertain him than his dumb puppy?“Good pup,” Jimin comments,  fingertips brushing up just under your chin to watch you curl into the touch. You love it when he talks to you this way when he is so kind and in a good mood. It makes your belly flip, but you can’t enjoy his pleasantries at the moment. The heat that continuously ruptures inside your gut is far too distracting. “Wanna treat,” your master asks, to which you furiously nod your head, tongue out like a dog in a car on a sunny day. Your shallow, quick panting fills the room, adding a little woof at the end. In each expression of your limited vocabulary, Jimin finds a different sentiment you try to convey. It makes him grin as he gives the order, “rollover.” You obey, following through with every demeaning command Jimin gives to you. He pats your head. “Look at my good girl,” he praises, lowering his head to meet your eyes as you pawed at his shoes. His hands fall to rest on his belt buckle. “Let me give you that treat.” 一Taehyung Despite the praises that spill from Taehyung’s lips, the frilly, pink dress he forced you in, only makes the situation degrading. The seed of embarrassment he plants inside you blooms upon your cheeks in an efflorescence Azalea hue. White ribbon cascades around your face like a waterfall from the pretty bow he tied in your hair. He manipulates your body into different positions as he forces you into the lolita dress while you obey the command to stay perfectly frozen.The only movement you make is blinking when your eyes begin to water. Every demand Taehyung makes after that provokes your temper; but, how do you have the right to be frustrated when you have already committed? You have already given yourself up to him, surrendered into submission long ago.  “My dumb doll can’t even speak,” Taehyung mumbles, speaking more to himself rather than you. A faint, whimsical grin dances across his lips as he places you up like a display on the other side of a glass container. It’s not like you can hear if you’re a toy anyway. Being light to hold in one’s hand is the only comparison you possessed to a doll, shrunken down from lack of food Taehyung was failing to provide. Taehyung holds you in his hands as if you’re the most delicate thing in the world. One wrong move and you’ll shatter to pieces. “My obedient babydoll.”一Jungkook Gut-wrenching, heart pumping, cold air bit into your lungs as you thrust your heavy legs forward. You were desperate for a break, eyes closing as you ran blindly through the empty alleyways in hopes that it could somehow give you the same energy that sleep would provide you. On the other hand, Jungkook was warming up. The thuds of your footfalls coming closer with each bound forwards. A rush of pure, mind-numbing adrenaline pumped through his veins with the liveliness of the chase. Jungkook’s strong arms caught you by your waist, tackling you to the dirty cement. It was laughable how easily he caught up to you, considering he had given you a headstart. You were beginning to regret agreeing to this obscene form of roleplay when you felt a warmth trickling down your brow. “You were doing so well, angel,” Jungkook heaves, the weight of his chest resting on your back, “I bet if we keep this up, you may be able to outrun me for a bit longer.”Relief flooded through you, while your sore limbs were rewarded a momentary pause from pushing themselves to the limit. Feeling Jungkook’s big hand pressed into the small of your back to push himself up, you knew your body was going to submit to a different form of exertion. You hear the sound of his belt. “Too bad you have to pay for your faults,” Jungkook says, low and unhurried, “remember, angel, you agreed to this.”

Smut scene (Oral m. and f. receiving, Fingering), Yandere Namjoon, Stalking, Drugging, Kidnapping 
Pairings:  Namjoon x Reader, Mention of Seokjin x Reader Summary: Kim Namjoon, famous author and your childhood friend has been keeping a secret from you. His new book treads on such dark themes that he’s finding it difficult to write. Excited by the prospect of a sinister plot you offer him a piece of advice, “Let the villain win…” …You look to the building pile of manuscripts on your desk, curling your lip over the prospect of reading them. You’re sure that some of them will be good, a couple of them might hold your attention, but none of them are the story that you truly want to read, the one that you are waiting for, the one that was due three days ago…“I’m going to kill him.” You mutter to yourself while taking a sip of tea. Kim Namjoon, one of the finest thriller authors ever to be published, and your best friend since childhood. You have the privilege to represent him as his literary agent, but that comes with its setbacks. Namjoon never seems to take you seriously when you set a deadline. Even now he’s off gallivanting somewhere, refusing to answer his calls or texts until he returns from his ‘creative space’.  Keep reading

anonymous asked:Can you do an idol!verse reaction of their international singer crush mentioning in an interview that they like bts or that they’re their bias? For Namjoon, Yoongi, and Jimin please. Thank you in advance!💜Reaction to Idol Crush Noticing ThemAdmin: @nomnomsik 🎉Trigger warning: yandere themes, physical violence, unhealthy obsession, and member violence. Please read with caution. YoongiOriginally posted by kimnamtaejin“Yoongi!” called his manager as said idol hunched over his piano, his fingers playing away and eyes closed in a tranquil state. Despite the call of his name, Yoongi paid the man no attention, continuing to play Fantaisie-Impromptu Op. 66. His manager huffed, walking over and tapping the idol’s shoulder, agitating the pianist who just glared at him while his hands stopped moving, moody. “What?” He spat out roughly, clearly not interested or caring for whatever his manager intended to say to him. His manager sighed at the disrespect, letting it slide this once because of the info he had that would have the idol in his debt. Yoongi softly played a few more piano keys, raising his hand up to pick another note, only to come to a rigid halt as the next words slipped out of his manager’s lips. “You like Y/N L/N, right?” He spoke quickly, immediately earning Yoongi’s attention as his eyes shot open, wide awake and his head snapped up to stare into the manager’s eyes. “I’ll take that as a yes then.” Yoongi slowly stood up from the piano chair, far more interested in where this conversation was going, and why you were even being mentioned to him. His manager slowly handed his phone over to Yoongi, a clip already loaded into YouTube as Yoongi watched it. “So, Y/N, are there are groups you like or want to collaborate with?” The interviewer had asked into his mic, question cards in his lap. “Of course!” You had chirped, Yoongi’s heart slowly increasing in pace, his ears picking up the tune of your voice and how smooth it always seemed to sound. He was mesmerized with your casual outfit, an oversized shirt and ripped jeans that seemed to make a parallel with what he always wore. “I really want to work with BTS. I love their music so much! I really like their rapper Yoong- I mean, Suga, hehe. He’s really my type too. Ahh, but they’re really popular so I mean-” You laughed nervously afterward, the video turning to black.  Yoongi could barely keep his feet standing as he seemed to stumble backward, hand catching himself on his desk as he stared in a trance. Y/n likes… Y/n likes me…? I’m Y/n’s type? “So…” his manager coughed purposely, grabbing the idol’s attention as Yoongi quickly handed back the phone in an embarrassed manner. His face was red, mouth open and breath slightly faster. He could hear his heart thumping into his chest and his legs giving out for the second time. “What’s your thoughts?” “Collaboration immediately,” Yoongi ordered, dead serious with his tone and gaze. “I want y/n in my studio immediately too.” His manager gave a slight nod, letting himself out and closing the door, lock sounding. “If I’m y/n’s type…” Yoongi murmured to himself. “And if I like y/n, then… then, our feelings are mutual and I-”“I can make y/n mine…”NamjoonOriginally posted by hope-filmClick ClickNamjoon stood in front of several cameras, giving his best poses as he smiled brightly, dimples always showing before the flashes went off. It went on for an hour, the idol finally sitting down in a groan and having time to relax. He scrolled through Twitter on his phone, internally laughing at some of the ridiculous tweets as well as memes, always amused how his fans seemed to make the best content. Tapping on the home icon, his feed refreshed, loading more content to consume, but before he zoomed past the top tweets, his eye caught a video of you, your face apparent in an interview-like video. Namjoon looked confusingly at his phone, wondering why you appeared on his feed when he wasn’t even on his private account, but the main twitter handle for the band.He popped in his airpods, playing the video and staring intently, knowing how you were always well-spoken and seemed to open his world up further and further. You were an endless source of information for him, always expanding his viewpoints and addressing issues that were important to you. In the end, he would be dedicated as much as you were to issues, immediately accepting your word as truth. “Y/n, are there any artists that you’ve been listening to recently? Anyone you want to work with in the future even if it’s unlikely?” The male interviewer asked, to which you smiled, nodding your head gracefully.“I’ve been listening to a mixtape- actually it’s called a playlist by the artist. Anyways, that’s beside the point.” You laughed, Namjoon’s heart thumping as if wondering, “Can it be? Could it actually be my…?” “It’s a playlist called Mono by RM and I’ve been listening to it a lot at night after a long day of work. It makes me feel vulnerable and it’s as if the artist is holding my hand and telling me it’s okay to feel this way.” You laughed again and Namjoon almost dropped his phone onto the ground, his hand growing weak as if his phone suddenly weighed 100 kilos. “I wish I was popular enough or, I don’t know, respected enough? I would like to work with BTS, but then again…” You sighed afterward, but still giving a warm smile to the camera, melancholy in your eyes. Namjoon could see straight through your facade, understanding that such a possibility would never be possible. “Manager-nim,” Namjoon called, taking out his airpods and grabbing the attention of the male who watched over Jungkook’s shoot. Namjoon handed over his phone, showing the video and gauging the reaction. “I want to work with Y/n. Someone finally gets it.” Namjoon insisted, clutching his chest. “Mono means so much to me… From this interview, Y/n seems to be here for the music. I want to work with someone like that. Please, I would do anything. Even if I have to suffer through a hundred more terrible interviews.”Pleading was something Kim Namjoon never did. If he ever wanted something, he always worked hard for it. But this was different. He wouldn’t be able to live with himself if he let this slip from his grip, this was his chance.“Please… I’ve never wanted something so badly in my life.” JiminOriginally posted by dailyjeonsJimin was squealing like a child, his phone in his hand as he sprinted around the BigHit office and into the dance studio, interrupting the other members who were practicing diligently in the mirror. “Guys, guys!” Jimin called excitedly, shoving his phone into each face of his members. “Y/n wants to work with us, mostly me though!” The members looked at him nervously, giving a small and timid nod, knowing how Jimin could get if the wrong words were spoken. The last time it happened, Taehyung was crying terribly, Jimin strangling him in the dorms. It was only a small joke that would’ve really been brushed off, but Jimin took it seriously, growing angry at the younger for disrespecting one of his favorite artists. Taehyung got startled by the slightly older’s searing rampage, deflecting the insults thrown at him, to which Jimin grabbed him. It wasn’t until the other boys interfered that Jimin calmed down. But they all knew not to mess with him and you. Anything said about you must be met with immediate positives, if not, they would face Jimin’s wrath. Taehyung seemed to shuffle in the back of the room, turning the other way and trying to have no part in the conversation. Namjoon and Hoseok quickly caught the growing tension in the room, immediately chiming in. “Go ask the manager,” Namjoon spoke softly to which Hoseok added. “We don’t have a problem with it anyways. Just get approval.” Jimin smiled brightly, running out of the room again to which all the boys sighed in relief, a storm had passed without anyone getting hurt. Jimin hummed to himself as he skipped, hopped, and jumped around the building, calling out for the manager. “Manager!” Jimin called, running up to the male and immediately spitting out bucket loads of words to which flustered the manager. Jimin noticed the manager’s initial confusion, growing upset. “Manager!” He pouted, crossing his arms. “I said I want to work with Y/n. Y/n told me that we should work together! Make that happen!” “Ohh~” The manager understood, clapping his hands together and smiling, which immediately brightened up Jimin’s demeanor. “Okay, I’ll get into contact with them for you.” As the manager turned to leave, Jimin stopped him by holding onto his shoulder. “No, manager,” Jimin spoke, his grip only tightening. “I meant, a vlive, to which I announce the collaboration.” “J-jimin…” His manager whispered in a hush voice. “We can’t do that without the other side’s approval from Y/n’s agencyfirst.” With a flash of rage, Jimin screamed, pushing his manager hard into the wall. “What do you mean approval?! Y/n told ME! If Y/n wants to work with me, then approval from the agency shouldn’t matter!” “I u-understand that Jimin, but it’s basic procedu-”“You clearly don’t understand.” Jimin seethed, grabbing hold of the man by the neck and pushing him into a secluded corner. “Do things have to get ugly or are you going to listen to me, manager-nim?”

            Persephone (Namjoon x Reader)        Pairing: Namjoon x ReaderWord Count: 18.3kWarnings: Yandere, Stalking, Obsession, Non-Consensual Touching, Kidnapping, Blood, Violence, Massacre, Organized Crime, Trafficking, Hard ManipulationI do not condone the acts displayed in this story nor do I believe any members of BTS would actually engage in this type of behavior. This is simply written for entertainment purposes and should not be taken as a reflection of my own values, opinions, or morals. Preview: That night was when the first rose arrived. After he had left you with a knowing look and your confused brother at the front door, abandoned for the night, you went to bed. When you entered the small bedroom you froze. Settled in the middle of your comforter was a single burgundy rose, the petals immediately taking you back to that night in the basement. They were a dead ringer for the shade of blood, bile burned in your throat as you spun away from the sight. You could swear you were going to vomit, you fucking hated red. Anger was burning through your veins as you flung your window open, violently ripping the crimson petals from the stem and throwing them out the window.The entire room was stark white, the lights so bright they reflected off the sterile surfaces, blinding you. Your hands trembled beyond control as your head twitched and jerked sporadically. Something was wrong but you couldn’t pin down exactly what it was, it was on the tip of your tongue, the thought dwelling in the back of your head, so close yet so far out of reach. The silence in the room was deafening, setting you on the edge of your seat as you gently began to tap the tips of your fingers against the barren table top. You could feel their eyes on you, drilling into your back and scanning every inch of your curled form. They needed you. You didn’t know why they left you there, alone amidst your thoughts and the static silence that aggravated you. They needed you, that much you were sure of.A metal slot in the wall screeched open, slicing through the quiet air. On a little tray there were scraps of paper and a sealed pack of markers. Instantly your trembling hands snatched the markers from the tray and violently ripped the packaging open, the tubes spilling out and rolling down the table. Automatically you reached for the red cap and yanked it off, quickly scribbling the pigment onto the piece of paper with no rhyme or reason. Soft clicks disturbed the silence again, cap after cap being removed and replaced, removed and replaced in a steady rhythm. The sheet of paper was decorated in swirls of purple, slashes of red, and soft pulls of blue uniting into a composition only you could comprehend at the moment.You could still feel them watching you, their presence never left you. Your right hand reached out once again for the next color, hesitating as you heard the steel door slowly begin to creep open. One of them had finally decided to come and visit. Your hand clamped down on the green marker and swiftly uncapped it, pressing it harshly into the paper and making quick strokes. He closed the door, in what he assumed to be a gentle manner, but every noise made in the room echoed in a disharmonic likeness. You tried your best to ignore him, eyes burning as they refused to blink until you finished your work. You only stilled when he pulled the chair out beside you, it screeched in an ungodly tone and he sat down; slinging his arm around the back of your chair. He was almost unbearably warm, alerting you to how cold the room truly was. The silence that passed between the two of you was uncomfortable, another brand of quiet you were accustomed to.“Will you show me what you saw?” He whispered, the tone of his voice deep in his chest as he leaned close. His warmth seeped into your side forcing you to stand up and the chair to screech back. You swept the papers and the tray from the table, their clattering piercing your ears as you snatched another marker. As soon as it was uncapped your hand flew to the blank surface of the table, violently sketching out what you had seen the night before. Blue, black, and red.Blue and black.Black, more black.Red and black. Red.Red.Red.And more red.Your breath came in harsh pants, tears blurring your vision as you forced yourself to keep scribbling down what you had witnessed. Red, red, red, and more red. The silence was deafening and his breaths cacophonous. Red, red, red and more red. Your head was hurting and your heart pounding against your ribs, trying to break free. Red, red ,red, and more red. Their screams still echoed in your mind. Red, red, red, and more red. The gunshots still rang in your ears and the glass still sliced your skin.They were all dead.

            Beastly Gods (M)        Pairings:  Hybrid!Taehyung x Reader x ???Word Count: 8KRating: MGenre: Hybrid AU, Thriller, DramaWarnings:  Smut scene (Unprotected Sex, Exhibitionism, Voyeurism, Fingering, Cum Play), Blood, Captivity, Themes of Obsession and Ownership.Summary: ‘Don’t leave the forest,’ a rule that you’ve been forced to follow since birth, but you are tired of living in this wooden cage. Out of desperation you cut a deal with Taehyung, who claims to be the only one who can get you out safely, even though he might be just as dangerous as the god you’re trying to escape.AN: Not your typical Hybrid AU. At first I was going to release secondary love interest information, but then I thought, fuck it, you’ll guys will just have to wait until the end to see who watches over the forest *Cackles*. Story is dedicated to @lovelesscherry​ who reblogged a cabin room photo that started this whole mess of an idea. …A large oak stands in front of you as your best method to reach the sky, the only tool you have for your small calculated rebellion. You’ve been taught since birth, ‘Don’t leave the forest. As long as you remain within the woods you are safe, but  anything which goes out beyond the line of trees is his to take. ’ The lessons refer to the so called protector of your forest, a self proclaimed god, and the one you live to hate. Some have made attempts to leave over the years, to go past the tree line but none of them have returned. The people of your village believe them to be dead but you hold out hope that maybe they found something better. You grab the first branch and haul yourself up. The first step is always the most difficult, with such a large distance between it and the forest floor. Going from there is only too easy, stepping from limb to limb as you make your rise to the top.    Three generations of your people have resided in this place. Some call it home but to you it is nothing more than a cage. The branches creating the bars which entrap you in this life. You wish to see the open sky unobscured by the reach of the trees, so everyday you make the climb to the highest tree top you can. Those that had made previous attempts to escape left the forest perimeter on the ground, but you take your brief moment of freedom from up high. You delight in having found a weakness in his pen, one god surely would have difficulty watching all sides of the forest, why would he even bother to check the treetops? Up here you are safe, you are free. It may seem like a pointless rebellion but to you it’s everything, reaching beyond the branches has become your way of showing that you are not complacent.

Kim Namjoon] [Reader-Insert]        Originally posted by ariescultsThe only reason I’m publishing this early is because I can’t stand looking at it anymore or writing for it anymore.  I really hate how this turned out. I haven’t done Namjoon justice :-)Warning: As this story contains yandere themes, the characters display behaviors that can be triggering or uncomfortable to read. Read at your own risk. This work is purely fiction. I do not believe any of the mentioned members would display any sort of this behaviour irl. Word Count: 2.9KIt was medieval times where almost every person had blood on their hands, and dark circles from stress and trauma permanently visible under their eyes. In this World Of Wrath, terms associated with peace and tranquility were long forgotten and humans and dragons hunted each other without mercy; it was an endless cycle. Each side always focused on the hurt they experienced, the ones they lost, and used that as a reason to justify their actions for fighting. No one tried to understand or think about how the other side felt the same hurt, loss, trauma, and emotions from killing and being killed. No one ever tried to make amends with the other except for one woman.She was a beauty among her kind and had courage to face a beast that no one would ever dare to face in their wildest dreams. She showed sympathy and understanding of an angel, and catered and helped others selflessly in a world where it was each man for himself. Despite the threats she received, the wounds she was given so she would fear him, and constant cold treatment, she remained selfless and warm. She was a holy being that existed like no other, and even though she was a human, her kindness had touched the dragon king’s heart and soon, she was accepted as one of their own. The love between her, and the previous dragon king allowed a creature like no other to exist. On the twelfth day of the ninth month, the next heir of the dragons was born; he was named Kim Namjoon. Due to the uniqueness of his existence, he was prophesied to be someone who would lead the dragons into a new era of triumphs, and do many great things in his lifetime. During his childhood years, Namjoon discovered abilities that were unique only to him. He was a shapeshifter; he was able to shift into a full dragon and into a human whenever he pleased. Once he had better control over his abilities, he learned to shift only one, or multiple parts of himself into his dragon form while the rest of him remained as a human and vice versa. He had a great future ahead of him especially because he was part of both worlds that seemed to want to annihilate each other. He had values of kindness, sympathy, and love he learned from his mother. His strong political, persuasive, leader, and powerful fighting abilities from his father. He was the perfect blend because he was believed to be the bridge that could exist between both worlds and help end the conflict. Namjoon was going to be the change and he was bright enough to believe in a peaceful future  that did not seem to exist. After meeting his mother and seeing the kindness she had, the other full-blood dragons had begun to change their perspectives on humans little by little as well. In their fights, dragons had started to spare more humans, and not attack without a reason. The Dragon King ordered his kind to stop hurting human children. After he had one of his own, he had began to develop sympathy for other parents. A shift was starting, and the amount of blood shedding was decreasing. The dragons were showing mercy, but humans perceived it as a sign of weakness. They thought the dragons were weakening. They saw this ‘weakness’ as their chance to end the fighting for once and for all, and make it end well in their favour. Other humans found out about the human the Dragon King had wedded and his new born child. At first they thought he wedded a human against her will. A group of few human men with excellent stealth skills sneaked into the dragon’s terrority to “rescue” Namjoon’s mother. However,  when they saw that she was actually happy in the presence of the Dragon King and her abomination of a child, they were extremely shocked. They perceived her actions as a betrayal to her own species. They failed to understand that she had married the Dragon King in the first place so she could show him the kindness that humans had, and prevent as many battles as she could between the dragons and humans. Her strategy was working. She had spend many months turn her plan into a reality. However, it was all ruined with few actions.  When everyone had begun their slumber for the night, the humans sneaked in and kidnapped the Dragon’s King wife and his child. Once they finish their preparations by binding his wife’s and child’s hands and legs to a tree, they started a huge rukus in order to grab the Dragon King’s attention. They waved torches of fire around Namjoon and his mother signalling to burn them as a threat if he did not come on time. The Dragon King had appeared in front of them in no time, and his enormous gigantic form loomed over the humans. With the loud and harsh air he exhaled, it was more than obvious that he was beyond pissed. His intimidating presence terrified the humans who had dared to mess with him, but they held their ground. With torches raised high, and smirks plastered on their faces, they spoke. “Kill yourself Dragon King, or watch us kill your wife and child,” They claimed, as they viciously whipped the fire close to Namjoon’s and his mother’s faces and she trembled in fear. The Dragon King narrowed his eyes at the lowly humans that had dared to challenge him. He spoke in a booming voice. “I will do no such thing. You’ll be the ones who will put down that torch and leave my family be if you want me to spare your lives,” Dragon King warned. While his threat caused some of the humans to tremble in fear, it did not phase one of them. Said human smirked, and threw the torch in his hand towards the Dragon King’s tied up wife. Everything seemed to be happening in slow motion as the flame torch flew towards Namjoon’s mother; she gasped, and the Dragon King’s eyes widened. The person who had thrown the flame started to raise his hand and signalled another human to make a move, who was hidden from the sight. Then, all of a sudden it was fast paced as the hot flames licked at the woman’s skin and started to burn her, causing her to scream out in pain. The Dragon King bellowed and was about to fly out towards the offenders to kill them but that never happened. “Shoot him now!” One of the humans screamed, and from behind where another was hidden, an arrow that had been dipped in lily poison harmful to the dragons, was shot. The arrow dug right into the life vein at back of the Dragon King’s neck. He screamed out in pain and his loud growl caused Namjoon, who had been unconscious so far, to jolt awake. He woke up to see his mother being burnt to death, and humans stabbing his father and digging various sharp weapons in him. It was on that day when Namjoon lost control to his dragon form, and killed ruthlessly for the first time that will lead to many more murders to come in the future. It was that one event that changed him for the rest of his life, and the boy that was supposed to be the change and be the bridge of piece in between worlds, was the change. But it was a change of horror, because the blood shed and battle between dragons and humans that existed for centuries, morphed into blood baths and wars under Namjoon’s reign.                         _______________________________________  Keep reading

Yandere! bts reactions — You’re scared of a bugOriginally posted by taeminesNamjoon “Namjoon-oppa!” Namjoon glanced up at you from the file he was perusing to see your eyes blown wide with fear.“What’s wrong, darling?” He asked, already standing up. “There’s a bug under a cup in the kitchen… can you get rid of it? Please?” Namjoon smirked at your desperate tone.“Of course I will, darling, but first, let’s negotiate what you will do for me in return.” “Oppa!” You whined, “Please just get it out of the house! I really hate bugs.”“If you hate them so much, then surely you’ll be willing to do something to ensure I get rid of them properly.”“Um… I could… make dinner for us tonight?” “I’m expecting something a little more than that.” “…I could give you a ‘thank you’ shoulder massage?” Namjoon sighed.“I mean of a sexual nature, darling.”“Oh!” Your lips formed into a circle as you blushed, and Namjoon was inspired.“Perhaps you can put those sweet lips of yours-“ he muttered, reaching a finger up to tug your bottom lip downwards, “to use, huh, darling?” “And you’ll get rid of the bug if I do?” You tried to say, though it was difficult with his finger in your mouth. “I promise, darling.” You took a deep breath, steadying yourself, before sinking to your knees. Namjoon smirked. He always got what he wanted in the end.Keep reading

            [Yandere Namjoon x Cat Hybrid Reader Headcannons: SFW and Lemon]        since I’ve been preparing for my upcoming exams, I’ve been super busy studying, so I’ve only been posting headcannons! Hopefully when summer break starts in a month, I’ll have time to release an actual fic lol- Instead of being sad that Rose Bowl is postponed, I decided to put my sad hours energy in writing lmaoo which is why it’s a lil long but anyways eat the rich except for rich boy Namjoon warnings: dubcon smut (sex toys, penetration, bondage, edging), yandere themes (normalization of toxic relationship values), confinement, brief mentions of past abuse and symptoms of PTSD, dehumanization, mentions of pain (shock collar)SFW:Namjoon doesn’t know what loneliness is; after all, he’s lived a pretty solitary life ever since he left his rich parents’ mansion for his own penthouse apartment. Even back then, in the mansion he should’ve called home, he was mostly by himself. His parents were too busy sealing business deals overseas and lavishly spending money on luxurious products to even take a proper look at their son.At least, he doesn’t know what loneliness is until he comes over to Seokjin’s house–Seokjin’s a friend he made back when he was studying business in an ivy league university overseas–and he notices how comfortable Seokjin is with the fluffy sugar glider hybrid he’s bought. Namjoon can’t seem to take his eyes off of the moment when Seokjin leans over and playfully presses a kiss to his hybrid’s forehead, and he especially can’t take his eyes off of the moment the hybrid chitters in pleasure and pushes her head into Seokjin’s embrace. Namjoon’s driver is surprised when Namjoon orders him to stop at the nearest hybrid shelter; Namjoon’s surprised by himself too. Namjoon is convinced you’re perfect for him. You’re so pretty, curled up in the corner of your cage at the shelter, looking at him with wide glossy eyes and practically trembling. The owner of the shelter tries to guide Namjoon to a different section of the shelter, the section reserved especially for those with big pockets where beautiful glossy rare hybrids pranced and preened, but Namjoon refuses to move from your more poorly maintained section, his eyes glued on you. You only snivel pathetically in response, tucking your puffed tail further between your legsKeep reading

            Level of Restraint (M)        Pairings: Jimin x Reader, Namjoon x Reader, Taehyung x ReaderWord Count: 13K Rating: M Genre: Thriller, smut, office AU, BDSM AU Warnings(contains spoilers): This story contains very dark themes and may not be suited to all readers, protected sex (vag+anal), threesome, double penetration, bondage (including partial suspension), dom/sub roles (reader is a sub), praise kink, mild degration, sensory deprivation, spanking, fingering, cum feeding, mild breathplay, sex toys, exhibitionism, voyeurism, discussion of safe word, Namjoon is a professional dom/sex worker, referenced discrimination of sex workers and those who participate in BDSM, public outing of sexual practices, inappropriate workplace relationships, referenced death of minor character, yandere character, misidentified sexual partner, manipulation, bribery, blackmail, implied stalking, violence.Summary: As a co-founder of a consulting firm you can’t afford to be caught in a scandal. So flirting with your secretary, Jimin, would be out of the question. Giving your client’s son, Taehyung, a reference for a sexual partner would be reprehensible. And having regular paid BDSM sessions with your dominant, Namjoon? That would be a career ending disgrace. It’s too bad the only restraints in life you approve of are the cuffs that bind you to the bed, because there are those hiding in the dark waiting to take advantage. A/N: A huge thank you to everyone who supported me while writing this story. It was hard not to question the level of darkness this tale descends to. In the end your assurances and aid are the only reason this fic made it to fruition. Upon reading you might notice several thematic references to the ‘Fall of the House of Usher,’ by Edgar Allan Poe  and the Greek myth of Tantalus. They are two of my favourite tales, and together they greatly represent the darkened desires depicted in this oneshot.…8:55 amKNJ: Good girl.Your heart races upon receiving the response you’ve been waiting for all morning. The sender had requested proof that you were wearing his last minute gift, and you were happy to oblige with the lewd photo. Finally seeing his simple praise for your efforts makes you grin from ear to ear, as you enter the front door to your workplace’s building. The message will be enough to get you through the day, high on the thought of his praise while his present is wrapped tightly around your ribs. Though the garment may be confining, you’ll endure anything to receive those two simple words.Reluctantly glancing up from your phone you look ahead to see the elevator closing.“Hold the door!” You call out, making a run for it. Mercifully the gap between the doors widens allowing you to climb in before it begins the long haul up. Glancing over to your savoir, you find your secretary standing at the panel. “Thanks Jimin.”“No problem,” he responds with a warm smile. “What floor do you need?” Joking as he pushes the button labelled 14. You playfully shove his arm while trying to catch your breath. Had he left you down on the first floor there’s no telling how long it would be before the elevator returned. The building in which you work has been down to one lift for a couple days, with no promise of when the other will be fixed. It’s not a surprise really, ever since you moved into this complex three years ago you’ve been plagued with breakdowns and shotty utilities. Considering how opulent  the tower is, with it’s gilded elevators and halls adorned in finery you expected better, but people often overlook flaws when they have something pleasant to stare at. Allowing the management to slack on some of the failings of the structure.  Keep reading

anonymous asked:Can I get a Yandere!Namjoon reacting to finding Y/N two years after she had escaped and he finds out that she was pregnant at the time and is now raising their child with somebody else?Originally posted by namjjoonsWord Count: 1.8KA/N: Thank you to @chinkbihh for coming up with the idea for this ask! I had a really bad headache while writing this, but I hope it came out well. [UNEDITED]Trigger warning: yandere-themes, unexpected pregnancy, single mother. Please do not read if you are sensitive to these topics. “Namjoon, it was a one-time thing. I don’t do second-times. We agreed that there would be no strings attached.”You grew irritated at the man that stood in front of you, your foot tapping onto the concrete. Your arms were folded in front of your chest as if to subconsciously protect yourself for something to come. His face was worn out, fatigue evident on his face from his sleepless nights. He had missed you terribly, often drifting into his thoughts on the park bench thinking about you. His daydreams varied often on a spectrum from somewhat believable to impossible. From date ideas to planning out your entire wedding with him, Namjoon had been through it all. He was tempted and captivated by your charm, unable to get enough of you. “Y/n… I just love you. I can’t help myself-!” He groaned, squeezing his eyes shut somewhat ashamed of not being able to control his emotions. Why did he have to feel this way? It’s like he enjoyed hurting himself. “Well, that’s cool, thanks for flattering me. But I have to go now, Namjoon. Cya, I guess.” You nonchalantly waved a hand, walking in the opposite direction. He was giving you a headache, a real pain in the ass to you. “You’re such a bitch!” He yelled as you walked away from him. “I care about you so much you wouldn’t be able to fucking understand. You’re such an overconfident whore!” He sneered, turning his heel in a fit of impulsive anger, stomping away. Just because you get all these men to sleep with you… You think you’re better than me, don’t you? You think I’m pathetic. Just because you’re so pretty and can get any man you want. I hope karma bites you fucking back. »»————- ————-««The door to Namjoon’s apartment slammed closed as he threw his boots off, his hair wet from the coming storm that poured over the time. The sky was crying with him for another failure for today. Thunder and lightning shook the ground as Namjoon watched the droplets slide down the glass like on his own skin. He grew frustrated as he sent his bag flying into the air and onto his couch. He took a seat on his comforter, folding his hands neatly on his lap. Rain droplets fell off the strands of his hair, onto his hand and clothes as he stared at the ground. It was a habit he had developed over the months of searching for you again… how long had it been? He brought a hand up to his forehead, difficulty in remembering your beautiful features. How long as it been since he had seen you? Was it in late spring? He had remembered seeing you quietly take a seat in the auditorium as you waited for your diploma. Although the space was filled with over hundreds of students who wore the same graduation outfit, he could quickly identify you from the way you walked and sat. Your back stood fully straight as if to show you overwhelming confidence in yourself. He remembered the way you crossed your legs, one of them aimlessly rocking in the air. That was the last time he had seen you. He missed you desperately, wishing to hear his name escape your lips one more time. How much had your hair grown? Did you cut it? Maybe you replaced your nail extensions… Ah, he was getting carried away again. With a shake of his head, he stood up, flicking on the bathroom lights as he stared at his reflection. Forgot to shave again.He sighed, prompting to pull up his shirt over his head and undress. When the temperature of the shower was warm enough, Namjoon once again lost himself in his thoughts. As the water attacked his skin, he had wished it was hundreds upon hundreds of kisses that were bestowed upon him by you. Or maybe, it was your touch that sent several shivers down his body, never having enough. “Why can’t you love me…?” He choked, a fist coming up to the tile wall of the shower. As he opened his eyes, he wasn’t sure if it was the shower or if he felt tears slip out of his eyes. »»————- ————-««Namjoon loved days like this. The weather screamed spring, the air sweet as honey but filled with pollen that killed him a bit inside. The sky was a beautiful coral blue with an abundance of white clouds that floated with it. The trees were finally blooming, their small buds popping up and announcing its arrival to the outside world. Namjoon felt the corner of his lips curl up as he resisted the urge to wave at the pink flower buds that poked out of the branches. His feet carried him to his favorite park, at the center of the town. Children roamed around it, running around and circling the large fountain that stood proudly at the center. Namjoon dodged a wild kid, sitting down on one of the old park benches as he enjoyed himself. It was a rare occurrence for him to experience this level of happiness. But it was days like this that made up for everything. As he stared at the kids that goofed off, his eyes landed a certain peculiar couple that stood near the trees. They took had a stroller with them, but there was some familiarity with them that he couldn’t truly grasp. It was until he saw the woman turn around, that he realized why they had caught his eye. He blinked several times, a hand also coming up to his face as he rubbed his eyes. Was he really seeing this right? He swore he saw your face, your features adorning a small smile as you looked down at the inside of the stroller. You were utterly beautiful, your hair cut the shortest he had ever seen it. Your style of clothing did a complete 180, instead preferring a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. He felt his cheeks heat up as he stared, your features showing a new maturity that left him speechless. It was only a year since he had seen you from graduation and yet, you were a new you. You were–His eye twitched, broken from his thoughts as he saw a man approach you, giving you a kiss on the lips. That’s right. You had a stroller with you. A child. And that man, who was he? »»————- ————-««“This can’t be happening!” You screeched, grabbing your hair as you stared at the pregnancy tester, the second line appears. “Nonono, this… This!!” You cried out, your hand shaking as you held onto the tester. Looking down at your stomach, you fell onto your knees of your bathroom, tears streaming down your face. “What do I do… Someone, p-please.” You sniffled, rubbing your eyes, the tester still in your hand. “Someone help me. What should I do?” You couldn’t go back to Namjoon even though you knew he was the father. He would be ecstatic. You knew that once you told him, he would definitely accept you, a smirk plastered on his face. Your gut knew it was wrong to stay with that man. He was no good. You threw the tester onto the ground. “Bastard probably fucking planned this…”The first two months were the worst with the constant throwing up and morning sickness that made you want to give up. But in that time of desperation, you had reconnected with a longtime friend of yours, only able to confide to him. “Hoseok… I need help. Please.” He had come swiftly to your side, immediately rushing over to you. The moment you opened the door for him, he had wrapped his arms around you, careful of your stomach. He had sat next to you, listening patiently as you broke down in front of him with your constant fears. How would you be a single mother? How were you going to tell this baby in the future that he would never meet his father? How were you going to face your parents? “We’ll get through it together. I’ll always be here to help you, y/n.” He smiled, opening his arms up to embrace you. “Do you want me to be with you?’You had told him, yes and he had stayed. Your feelings slowly blossomed, no longer feeling the need to hook up and fool around. Hoseok had given you the security and stability you needed in your newly changing life. It was not long until Hoseok had asked you to marry you. It confused you when he had suddenly proposed. A part of you wanted to reject him, knowing he had done it to help your situation. You wondered why he went this far for you to which he had responded because he wouldn’t mind living with you forever. He was constantly happy, always lifting up the mood. But some days, you would see a frown plastered on his face as he watched you cry your eyes out. Scared, cold, and terrified of this baby that was in your stomach. He was always fine in raising someone else’s child. “Why would it matter if it’s not mine?” he asked when you had woken him up one night, on the verge of another breakdown. You never understood why he had stuck with you, no matter how many times he had told you that it was because he cared about you. It never made sense. How could someone care for you to this extent? To give their life to you for a mistake you had made? Hoseok had never touched you, only opting to kiss your lips and cuddle you. His eyes lit up the first time he had felt the kick of your child that he would have the honor of raising. It was moments like this that maybe you two indeed loved each other. »»————- ————-««“Hoseok, I’m going to be right back. I need to use the bathroom.” He nodded, gently rolling the stroller back and forth as he sat on the bench. He let out a sound of delight as he looked up at the birds that flew overhead and out to the port of the town. “Excuse me?” Hoseok looked over at a man who had shyly taken a seat next to him. “I hope you don’t mind.” “Of course I don’t.” He smiled, his eyes peering at his sleeping child. “Oh wow, she’s beautiful. Congratulations.” He heard the man compliment. Hoseok shook his hand, trying to remain modest. “Thank you… Though, I’m sad to say she’s not mine.” Hoseok still sent the stranger a smile, not seeing the dark undertones that the stranger hid. The stranger stood up, brushing himself off as he extended his hand. “Hi, I’m Namjoon. You?”“Hoseok.”“Nice to meet you, Hoseok. Hope to see you soon. Tell y/n I sent my congratulations.”“Of course. Thank you, Namjoon.” Namjoon walked off, smiling up as he left the park and back to his apartment. When you had come back, Hoseok opened his mouth to speak. He frowned as he recalled the encounter with Namjoon. When did he tell him your name?

            The Hierophant - Yandere! Namjoon x reader        The Tarot Series“He’s one of the best in the country. Trust me, (Y/N), you have to go to every lecture, even if you don’t want to.” The girl beside (Y/N) rattled on, only stopping every once in a while to take a sip of her Red Bull.“If you don’t want to go, I’ll gladly take your place, you know.” Her friend continued. “I swear, he’s like… perfect. Gorgeous, smart, rich… I would gladly hop on that, ya know?”“Oh come on, don’t degrade yourself like that. He’s going to be some musty professor that’ll talk about Sigmund Freud for far too long then set us three chapters to read for tomorrow.” (Y/N) was dreading meeting her new psychology lecturer, no matter how enticing the ideas her friend was feeding to her may be. “If you say so. But you better run now, or you’ll be late.” Her heart dropped when she checked her watch, seeing as she had two minutes to get to a classroom four minutes away. In a matter of seconds she gathered all of her leftover lunch together and shoved it in her bag, not even sparing a moment to say goodbye to her friend before dashing off, heart pounding as she ran.Just as the clock-hands of her watch hit one-thirty, she made it to the classroom, swinging open the door and making her way to the first available seat her eyes landed on, which just so happened to be in the aisle on the first row.However, once she’d dumped all her bags at her feet, she found that the professor wasn’t there. All of the students were just talking amongst themselves.“Today was the one day that it’s okay to be late.” The guy next to her chuckled, watching her catch her breath. “What kind of example is he setting for us?”(Y/N) chuckled breathily, but as if like magic a tall, lean man entered the room, a pile of books and papers stacked on top of each other impressively.“Good afternoon.” His deep voice reverberated around the room, immediately silencing all the small murmurs. “I apologise for not being punctual, but I had to help one of our more senior members of staff find her keys.”Kim Namjoon was far from the crumpled old man she’d expected him to be. His face didn’t show a single sign of ageing, despite him having an aura of maturity and expertise that put him high above every other person in the room. His face was neatly combed out of his face, his black rimmed glasses were stylish and perfectly clean. He was the epitome of a perfect man, if such a person could exist.He smirked seeing the stunned expression on his students’ faces.“I’m sure that you had very different first impressions of me. But I would like you to hold back until you know more about me. I hope that we can all develop a good relationship.” As he spoke, his eyes drifted across the room, until they met with (Y/N)’s own curious eyes, with something unreadable in his eyes that sent a shiver down (Y/N)’s spine.Once he’d started the lecture, (Y/N) felt as if she was in another country. The technical way he spoke, his hypnotising good looks. It felt impossible to keep up with him, and before she knew it everyone was packing away their notes. She was stunned for a few seconds but followed suit, unfortunately ending up as the last person in the classroom besides the professor.“What’s your name?” (Y/N) jumped when she noticed Namjoon in front of her, his large hands resting on the desk.“(Y/N).” She replied quickly, standing up and ducking her head so she didn’t have to make eye contact.“(Y/N), if you don’t mind me saying, you seemed to be quite unfocused for the majority of the time. If you need me to slow down my talking pace for you, you just need to ask.” The young woman felt her face flare up in anger at his patronisation. Sure, what he was saying was true, but there was no need to talk to her as if she was unique. Surely the other students were struggling to concentrate as well?She chose not to respond, slinging her book bag over her shoulder and leaving without a goodbye, determined to study as hard as she could and prove him wrong.*.·:·.☽✧    ✦    ✧☾.·:·.*Yet no matter how many hours she spent pouring over textbooks, podcasts, any kind of material she could get her hands on, none of it seemed to work for her. In a moment of desperation she’d downloaded a few of the books written by Kim Namjoon himself, only to give up a few chapters in due to the overly sophisticated language that made every sentence feel like a chore to read. (Y/N)’s severe lack of understanding was reflected in her grades. Constantly failing tests or just barely scraping by for the entire year. It wasn’t until the end of the year that she decided she would have to sacrifice her pride and talk to Namjoon.She knocked on his door, waiting for him to call out ‘come in’. Sure enough, she heard his voice - a little raspier than usual - invite her to enter.The inside of his office was different. It looked messier than usual, and the man himself looked slightly ruffled, his tie undone and suit jacket lying on the back of his chair.“(Y/N)! How can I help?” He asked, sitting up to look slightly more composed than his surroundings.“Is something wrong, professor?” She asked, concerned about how the usually neat and proper scholar had fallen.“Oh, it’s… nothing (Y/N). But thank you for your concern. What brings you here, anyway, besides the pleasure of my company?” Namjoon asked, running a hand through his slightly damp hair to smooth it down.“I think it’s best that I withdraw from this course, professor. I keep on failing the exams and there’s no way for me to catch up and pass this year. I just can’t afford to keep studying a subject I don’t understand.” He sighed. “Take a seat for me, (Y/N). We can talk about this.” (Y/N) wanted nothing more than to run, to leave this university and all the pain it had caused her behind, yet she ultimately had no choice but to sit down and shut up.“So you’re worried about failing? That’s why you want to drop out?” Namjoon queried, brows furrowed as if he was deep in thought.“Yeah. There’s no point in me paying nine grand a year if I can’t understand what I’m studying.” “What if I offer you extra credit? From what I can recall, your exams weren’t too bad so we could probably get you a passing grade.” The scholar offered, reaching for his laptop and opening a spreadsheet with a single click.“We can get you an extra 5%, which should bring you up to Third if your grades don’t improve in the summer exams. I’ve got a range of topics, and I’ll tutor you on whichever ones you choose when you have free time.” His words could not have been sweeter music to (Y/N)’s ears, knowing that passing was not just a fallacious dream and that she wasn’t a hopeless case.“Thank you so much Namjoon, I’m really grateful for this opportunity!” She smiled, but before she could leave he spoke again.“Of course, I don’t have to help you if I don’t want to.” (Y/N) froze as he continued. “This will cost me a lot of my valuable time, and I’m under no obligation to tutor you outside of work.”“Please…” (Y/N) whispered, tearing up.“You don’t have to pay me, if that was what you were thinking.” He stood up, approaching her until he had her backed up against the door. “I’d rather you pay me with your company. Tonight, you can come to dinner with me. Just one date, so we can get to know each other more intimately, and I can find out about the student I’m giving up my few spare hours to help. Does that sound good?” “This is sexual harassment… if I reported you you’d be at least suspended by the school board…” (Y/N) choked out, trying to appear tough when her insides were jelly from such close contact with Namjoon.“You can.” He chuckled. “But then you’ll fail and drop out. You don’t really want that, do you darling?”(Y/N) swallowed and nodded, breathing out as Namjoon stepped away from her.“Be ready at seven tonight. And wear something nice, darling. Don’t make me regret my offer.”*.·:·.☽✧    ✦    ✧☾.·:·.*The feeling of Namjoon’s eyes lingering on her figure was bittersweet. She was slightly flattered, but slightly intimidated. This man held her academic career in his hand, and she had to play along with his game if she didn’t want to fail.‘Maybe it isn’t so bad that he likes you.’ A voice was whispering in the back of her head. ‘He’s “gorgeous, rich, smart”… right?’She glanced over at Namjoon, immediately meeting his eyes. His hand settled itself on her exposed thigh, the cool metal of his rings contrasting with her warm skin. It stayed there until the taxi pulled up outside some esteemed restaurant, Namjoon pulling out his wallet to pay the driver and telling him to keep the change as he helped (Y/N) out.She felt slightly awkward as he led her in and asked their water about the booth reservation, feeling the judging eyes of people around her. No doubt criticising her for going on a date with an older man. They were already labelling her as a gold digger, a whore. “Don’t look at everyone else.” She jumped slightly when she heard Namjoon whisper in her ear. “Just keep your eyes on me, darling.”Namjoon was clearly more comfortable in this environment than (Y/N). Easily pronouncing the name of some expensive Italian wine for them, along with a dish that she’d never heard of for them both.But (Y/N) followed his advice, and just kept looking at him as he poured two glasses from the graft of wine, observing the slight bob of his Adam’s apple of he drank from his own glass.“(Y/N), you should try some.” He indicated towards her glass. “I-I don’t drink.” She said, but after a few moments of awkward silence, she decided to take a sip. She hated the taste, but refused to show it on her face, giving him a small smile before setting down the glass.“Now, (Y/N). Tell me why you decided to take Psychology when you don’t understand the subject?” Namjoon asked. “I just want to understand people. I thought maybe if I understand why people are the way they are, I can help them.” She explained, taking another sip from her wine. Now that her tongue had adjusted to the bitter palette, she was pleasantly surprised by the taste. “I see. Not many people take the subject for such a noble cause.” He commented. “Most of my students take it since they want to learn about serial killers or social experiments.”“And why did you choose psychology as your profession?” (Y/N) retorted.“There’s something about it that spoke to me. Jungian ideas on how we present ourselves - our persona - versus who we really are - our anima, if you will. I feel like there’s more to a person like you, (Y/N), and I want to see that.” The young woman felt like her head was spinning, from the lights all around her to the alcohol in her system.“I’m sorry, I need to go to the bathroom. Where is it?” “Just through that door.” Namjoon smiled watching her walk off. It was so fascinating to talk to her one-to-one. Her mind was something that wasn’t quite captured on her social media, no matter how many hours he spent pouring over her Facebook or Instagram, desperate to see who she really was, and why she drew him in like a magnet. But now, being in a more private environment with her and seeing her real self rather than what she presented online, Namjoon felt that she was even more enticing than before. Of course, he’d jumped at the opportunity to privately tutor her, but he had an idea for things to be more permanent. He didn’t want to just be her quick fix, he wanted to be her everything.And so, with a glance to make sure no waiters were going to enter, he pulled a small vial out of his pocket, tapping its contents into (Y/N)’s water glass. It wasn’t a particularly strong drug, nor was it fast acting. He would be able to enjoy the rest of their night, and then by the end she would be his.“Sorry. I don’t think I’m good with alcohol.” (Y/N) gave him a weak smile as she slid back into her seat.“Don’t worry about it, Darling. Just have some water, okay?” Namjoon said smoothly, as she gave him a gracious nod. As the meal progressed, however, (Y/N) felt her headache getting worse and worse.“Namjoon, this has been a lovely evening and all, but I need to go home. My head is killing me and I need some ibuprofen.” (Y/N) groaned after they’d finished their desserts.“Of course. Let me pay the bill and then I can take you home.” Her professor said, rubbing a hand on her back to soothe her as he beckoned their server over.Just as Namjoon was helping her into the car, (Y/N) felt her mind slip away, collapsing onto the seat.Namjoon simply explained to the driver that she was unwell, sitting her upright and giving him the address to his own house. The driver didn’t question anything, although with the slight twitch of his lip it was clear how he saw (Y/N), as some rich man’s whore who’d had too much to drink. Evidently, (Y/N)’s image was nothing compared to her professor, and she still had much to learn on how he worked. Luckily, he was more than happy to teach her, to train her mind, for his own, more personal price.

            Out of Pity        Originally posted by parkjiminerSummary: Namjoon has loved you ever since he was a kid. Despite looking after him, he was a young and immature burden. Hoping that one day you’ll finally realize his feelings, he spends years pursuing after you. But how long will it take before he is no longer the childish boy you remembered so many years before? “There’s no amount of roses I can pick from out the ground to make you love me, again.” - Honne’s Forget Me NotPairing: Namjoon x FEM!ReaderWord Count: 3.2K A/N: Special thanks to the loml @kimseokmomjins for giving me advice on the plot for this one-shot. Trigger warnings: yandere-themes, intense pinning, obsession, manipulation, noona-kink, bleeding, unhealthy relationship. Please do not read if you are sensitive to these topics. “Ouch! Fuc-” You mouthed the curse word, holding onto your leg. “Ow, ow, ow!” You winced in pain as rapid footsteps hurried towards you.“Are you alright, noona?” The small and clumsy male crashed into several Amazon boxes that sat on the floor as he held both hands in the air, desperate to help you but nervous he’d only make the situation worse. His eyes darted back and forth as you held onto your leg. His arms hesitated before he said “screw it” and dragged you from your feet to lay you down on the nearby sofa. “Are you bleeding?” “Ahh, fuck fuck.” Your body shuttered as pins and needles shot from your foot up to your body. “Ahh, Joonie you better move before I accidentally punch you in the face because-!” You choked, body hunching as you grabbed your leg again. “I’ll get some ice, noona.” His small legs carried him over to the freezer, going on his toes and grabbing an ice pack. With delicate motions, he folded it with a white cloth and handed it to you.“T-thanks…” You muttered before squeezing your eyes from the pain. “What’d you even do?” He asked, taking a seat next to your sprawled out figure. You were breathing heavily, turning to your side with the cold pack on your leg. “I think… I sat on the toilet for too long…” You whispered. Namjoon stared at you before breaking into a laugh. As he propped his head on his elbow, he gave you a smile. With his young and still growing features, his gaze held an immature and naive feeling that made you want to protect him.“You’re so ridiculous sometimes, noona.”“Only sometimes? Wow, I think I deserve b-better.” You choked out a laugh, the stinging pain once again shocking your body. “Also, noona, mom told me that it’s not good to curse.” “Ahh, sorry about that Joonie.” You smiled, ruffling the top of his head as his doe eyes stared back at you. He closed his eyes, enjoying the petting feeling. “Haha, do you like this Joonie?” “Yes, noona…” He blushed, his cheeks emitting a small pink color. “I also l-like you, noona…” “I like you too, Joonie~“ You attacked him, the two of you rolling onto the wooden floors as you giggled. Namjoon laughed along, his cheeks sticking out as he stared back at you. “A-ah… Noona are you walking with me to school?” Namjoon whispered, his fingers fidgeting with each other. “Aww, Joonie, you know noona can’t. I’m in high school now.” Namjoon wrapped his arms tightly around you, not wanting to let go. He pouted cutely and his immature actions made him adorable. You smiled and sighed, looking down at the younger boy. “How about, noona will pick you up when school’s over since she gets out earlier?” Namjoon’s head shot up as his eyes sparkled. He nodded his head vigorously in delight, squealing with excitement.“Alright then! C’mon let’s get ready. It would be awkward if you were late even when your mom dropped you off here early.” You stood up, brushing yourself off as you grabbed your bag and waited at the door. Namjoon waddled over, sliding his sneakers on. The two of you walked out, Namjoon waiting for you as you locked the front door. You walked together in the beautiful weather before parting ways at the next street. You waved him off, finding his pouting face amusing and his glasses that barely fit his face slowly sliding down. He tried not to show his major distaste at the separation, but there was no hiding he was upset. Alone, you walked silently to your high school, your mind reminiscing about your past with Namjoon. You had met him when he was only eight years old, a shy baby who couldn’t even speak properly when he addressed you. He was a stuttering mess, hiding behind his parents with his face as red as a tomato.His fragility gave you a sense of belonging to protect and look after him. His happy eyes and the way he smiled brightened the world around you like a hundred stars gracing down at you from above. The poor kid always followed you around, refusing to part ways unless it was an absolute necessity. You were lucky that you were moving on, looking forward to the future. You were in high school, nervous but excited for the next step, the next path. You surrounded yourself with good people, those who supported you and shared similar beliefs as you. It was those people that made you remember how good it felt to have friends. Did Namjoon ever have a social group? At the age of 12, you still couldn’t believe how he immaturely wanted to be where you were all the time. "I wanna be older like noona!” He would whine. “It’s not fair!”He was truly an adorable kid that you couldn’t help but wonder how he’d grow up. Would he still be shy and flustered? You laughed at the thought, thinking of how he would still hide behind you even when he grew up to be an adult. While you were spending time with the most important people in your life, it was days like these that Namjoon would often find himself alone, his nose stuck in a book. He was always studying, researching. Even at the age of twelve, this habit would progress in the future. However, today was different. You kept your promise and you walked to the middle school. But, you couldn’t help the chill running down your back as if something was wrong. You entered the gates, watching as all the youngsters screamed and ran out of the school in excitement. Your eyes scanned the groups of kids who came out, looking for the shy and reserved boy. But even after all the classes were dismissed, he never came out. You told yourself not to worry, he was probably running late. But, after the twenty-minute mark, you entered the building and walked into the main office. “Kim Namjoon?” The secretary repeated. “Oh, he said he wanted to see the garden.”You thanked her, walking toward the back of the school where they had their garden. See nothing wrong. You’re just being paranoid.  Keep reading

            Recrudescence (1)        Originally posted by jungkookpdSummary:  It’s nearly easy as breathing (for six of them, at least) for BTS to pretend to be just like everyone else - humans with big dreams and aspirations. But one person brings the façade crashing to the ground and for some reason, they just can’t let her go.Tags: @fandomstoryteller @justapotatonowComment if you want to be added to the tag list!PrologueChapter One There are few chances for I - ARMY to interact with their beloved boys and, depending on where they lived, no chance at all. Those lucky enough to get to see them are limited to concerts where they scream their hearts out, their idols just close enough to be out of reach. K - ARMY, on the other hand, have it much easier. Fan meets, regular performances, appearances on commercials, hell, they might even see them on the streets.But this is an exception. When Big Hit announced the internationally open songwriting competition, it sparked pure mayhem. Millions upon millions of entries in all sorts of languages flooded in despite the contest only running for two weeks. It took Big Hit months to sort through them all and choose the finalists, six songwriters who get to come to Korea to work with the producers and the boys themselves, the best song being recorded and placed on the upcoming album. Y/N had submitted on the very first day. It couldn’t have taken more than fifteen minutes of effort, a simple song about the pure and innocent happiness of childhood summers. She knew when she wrote it that she wouldn’t get in. She hadn’t submitted with the hope that she would. She did it because she wanted to look back at her youth and say she lived it to the fullest. She wants no regrets.So what the hell is this email?YN stares at the unopened email named “Congratulations” in her inbox, hand shaking slightly.This has got to be a prank, right?But just as she gets ready to delete the email, a twitter notification pops up on her screen. It’s from Big Hit’s official account. The tweet links every contest winner’s account and low and behold, her very own is listed at number six.With a gulp, the girl reopens her email, reading the mail from the company in disbelief. One month later, YN stands in front of Big Hit Ent in awe, not believing that she’s really here. The meeting she and the other winners are required to attend doesn’t start for an entire hour, but restlessness keeps her from relaxing in the very luxurious hotel room she’d placed in. Before she arrived in Korea two days ago, YN read the lyrics to the other constant’s songs and they were all far superior to hers. She can’t understand why she’d been chosen as a finalist when her song was rudimentary at best. She’s not unconvinced that there’s been some sort of mistake, that someone mixed up her song and some else’s.It’s that fear of being offered an apology and sent home prematurely that has her here so early, the girl determined to soak up everything she can while she has the opportunity. Meanwhile, deep inside of the company, Taehyung has his face buried in the crook of some faceless woman’s neck, a low, deep moan escaping his throat as he takes another pull of the tantalizing liquid slipping down her skin.“You’ll kill her,” Seokjin says, tone dry and uninterested.Taehyung pulls away from the dazed women only to shoot a glare at the man across the room.“And?” He asks, licking his lips. “And I don’t feel like getting rid of another body. I’m tired of having to clean up after all of your messes,” Jin replies, shooting a cold glare at the other man.“Fucking drama queen,” Taehyung says, rolling his eyes before licking a long stripe up the woman’s neck, sealing her wounds. “What did you just say?” Jin asks, pushing off the wall threateningly. “Why do you always have to whine so damn much, huh? Stop breathing down my neck,” Taehyung says, rising up as well.“Both of you, chill out. If you’re going to fight, do it later. We’ve got to meet up with those contest winners soon. We don’t have time to deal with your nonsense,” Namjoon says, annoyed.They couldn’t go ten minutes without a fight breaking out. You’d think after six thousand years together, they’d be more civil with each other. If anything, they seem to get more hostile every millennia. Jin leans back against the wall and Taehyung gives a smug smirk before Jin raises his finger and sends him across the room, Taehyung hitting the wall with a deep thud. On a couch on the other side of the wall, Jimin sits cross-legged, flipping a coin up into the air over and over, eyes glazed over. Jungkook sits beside him, humming music with headphones over his ears. He flinches when the coin suddenly smacks him in the forehead, causing Jungkook to slide his headphones over his ears.“Shut up. No one wants to hear your annoying ass voice,” Jimin snarls out before grabbing the coin and resuming his actions. Jungkook glares at the man, catching the coin in the air and throwing it across the room where Taehyung lays cursing in a heap on the floor. Jimin’s up in a moment, reclaiming the coin and flipping Jungkook off, who returns the gesture. Hoseok stands next to Namjoon, the two watching the scene in disgust. They can’t stand being around the four of them, but they don’t really have another choice. As much as they’d like to leave them, they know they’re better off sticking around. “How much longer until we have to get to the meeting room?” Taehyung asks, standing and brushing himself off.By now, the girl’s unconscious, and will most likely remain that way for a day or two. Taehyung’s venom takes the human system a while to overcome, making it easy to subdue and kill them. A person can’t survive getting poisoned with it more than once. “About ten minutes,” Hoseok replies.“Yoongi better get his ass here then. We don’t have time to be waiting around,”Just then, through a cloud of suddenly appearing black smoke, the man in question appears.“Speak of the devil,” Seokjin says, only to receive a cold look.“We missed you,” Namjoon and Hoseok chime, causing Yoongi to smile a bit.“I missed you more,”“Oh, barf,” Taehyung says, sticking his finger down his throat.As if he even has a gag reflex. “Whatever,” the three say in tandem.“I got everything straightened up down there. The problem’s been solved and the boss is already doling out punishments. He said he won’t need us for the rest of today, though we should check in tomorrow,”Namjoon and Hoseok nod. Just then, one of the coordi noonas knocks on the door before sticking her head in.“Come on up, boys. They’re ready for you,”She doesn’t see the passed out chick on the couch or the blood on Taehyung’s too long teeth.“We’ll be right there,” Hoseok says, flashing her a smile.The human leaves and the supernaturals follow, Taehyung licking the remnants of blood from his shortening canines. “Who even came up with his dumbass contest again? Why do we have to do this? I hate having to play dumb in front of the Int ARMY,” Jimin complains, rubbing the coin between his thumb and forefinger. “PD nim. And yeah, it’s tiring, but if you want to keep playing with those shiny things of yours Jimin, then we have to keep them happy,” Jimin blows his bangs out of his eyes, annoyed.Jungkook chuckles.“Who you laughing at?” Jimin snaps.“You,” Jungkook mouths. Before they can fight again, the seven of them make it into the large meeting room, all slipping inside. It appears that everyone is here already, but Bang PD nim is giving some speech about specifics and rules and yadda yadda, all of the fresh meat contest winners facing away from the boys. None of them notice the boy’s entrance as they all pay rapt attention to the presentation, but the CEO is quick to point them out, six sets of eyes drilling into them.And then the world is white, bright, blooming color exploding in their brains as time grinds to a halt, their senses overrun as they take her in, some low, primal instinct of theirs clawing its way up to the surface, the desire to take her into their arms and never, ever, let go overwhelming them.All seven, eyes seeing only her growl out, lowly but undeniable one single word:“Mine,”Chapter Two

            The High Priestess - Yandere! Namjoon x reader        The Tarot Series “Again, I’m so sorry for your loss.” The deep voice led (Y/N) to raise to her tear-streaked face to meet the gaze of the speaker. The detective sighed, taking a seat next to her, a little too close for (Y/N)’s liking.“Yoongi was one of the best men that I have ever had the honour of working with. I’ll do anything to find justice for him, I swear.” (Y/N) just sniffed.“What do you know so far?” She asked, rubbing at her bloodshot eyes.“We’re still working on the autopsy but it looks like he was killed with a six inch blade, with little signs of struggle. Must have been a surprise attack.” Namjoon sighed. “Is there anyone else who has a copy of your keys?”“Our next door neighbour does. Why? Surely it must have been an intruder, it couldn’t possibly be someone we know?” The words got caught in (Y/N)’s throat.“There’s no signs of a break in. Your husband must have let them in.” Namjoon was watching her closely, observing the way her teeth nervously grazed at her lips, the way her eyes were shaking from intense emotion. Something about her grieving was wrong, too obvious. He was determined to find the truth, no matter how grim it may be.*.·:·.☽✧    ✦    ✧☾.·:·.*The investigation had hit a dead end it seemed. There were no witnesses to say they’d seen someone leaving the scene of the crime, there was no sign of the incriminating murder weapon, there was no apparent reason to kill a young police officer who’d only ever made arrests for petty crimes. But Namjoon knew better than to dismiss the case as impossible. In fact, with the scenario becoming more and more complicated, the truth that he dreaded was becoming more believable. His theory, whilst being unbelievable to his heart, was the only credible line of reasoning he could follow. Thus he took it into his own hands, within his own time, to investigate the Min household once more.It wasn’t at all proper for a senior detective to be breaking into the victim’s house, not whilst the widow was once again sleeping in the bedroom. Yet, he’d done it before, and he was happy to do it again.His lust for the wife of one of his trusted officers was not something Kim Namjoon was proud of. He tried hard to keep it under wraps, not once making a move on her or looking at her in a less than innocent way at dinner. But occasionally, in the witching hour, he would allow himself the luxury of using a copy he’d made of Yoongi’s keys to enter their house, to stalk up to their bedroom and to watch her for a few minutes. To see the deep rise and fall of her chest, the scrunch of her nose as she dreamed. He didn’t even mind seeing her snuggled up next to her husband, imagining himself in the other man’s position with (Y/N)’s soft chest pressed against his body, her warm breath fanning his skin.But on this occasion, Namjoon wasn’t going to stare at the woman he craved after, as much as he wanted to. He was looking for evidence, something that had been missed, or even hidden away. But everything was eerily neat. No knives were out of place, nothing tucked under a bookcase or hidden behind a book. Yet, just as he was about to give up, he decided to risk entering the master bedroom.He didn’t let himself get distracted by the peacefully resting (Y/N), nor the space on the bed beside her. Instead, he quietly starting sifting through the drawers, looking for something.And he found it.Tucked away at the back of her undergarment drawer (something that had made Namjoon blush greatly as he searched through) was a plain cotton dress. It seemed like nothing out of the ordinary, just a plain, everyday dress. But the front was speckled with ruby red blood. Now confident in his conjecture, he placed the incriminating item of clothing in the plastic bag he’d brought with him, ready to confront the killer.*.·:·.☽✧    ✦    ✧☾.·:·.*“Inspector! How can I help!” The widow gave him an empty smile, the door only half open.“I need to talk with you, Miss (Y/N). May I come in?” Namjoon smiled, clutching his briefcase tightly as if to brace himself.“Inspector, it’s very early. I’m still in my nightclothes I’m afraid. And you look positively exhausted. Maybe it’s best if you come later.” (Y/N) tried to close the door, only for Namjoon to jam his hand on the doorframe, keeping it open at the cost of a severe crushing pain.“This is a very important matter to be discussed. I just thought you’d prefer to have it here, rather than down at the station.” The young woman gulped, nodded, and opened the door just wide enough to let Namjoon in.“Would you like some tea?” (Y/N) offered once he was seated at the kitchen table.“That would be wonderful. Thank you.” He answered. There was nothing but mirth in his body as he watched her bustle around anxiously, finding the tea leaves and the expensive tea set that was only used when they had special guests.Once the kettle had finished boiling, and the tea was brewing inside the overly decorative pot, Namjoon decided to speak.“I’ve discovered who killed your husband.” At his words, (Y/N) smiled just a bit too falsely, picking up the pot with shaking hands. “Really? Who was it, Inspector? Has he been arrested?” She asked, as she poured the tea into his cup.“I know that it was you, Miss (Y/N).” (Y/N) appeared calm at first, still pouring the tea into her own cup, but Namjoon could see past her facade.“Inspector, that’s ridiculous, I mean how on earth could I-” She started, only to be cut off.“Please, call me Namjoon. And the only way that this case makes sense is if you are the culprit. After all, why would your husband let a stranger into the house and then turn his back blindly?” Seeing his suspect completely speechless, he continued. “I have no doubt you used one of those knives and cleaned it thoroughly after the incident. I’m sure we don’t need to send it off to be tested for traces of blood, but I’m happy to do so if you’d like.”“This is all b-baseless thinking with no real e-evidence behind it.” (Y/N) stuttered.“I do have some evidence, actually.” Namjoon said, opening his briefcase and pulling out the bloodstained item of clothing. “This is yours, is it not? Whilst I haven’t sent it to the lab yet, I think we both know who this blood belongs to.”(Y/N) face warped from one of confusion to utter anger in a matter of seconds as she processed what was in front of her.“How did you get that? You don’t have a warrant, that’s illegal evidence-”“So it is yours.” Namjoon smirked, neatly. “I think your reaction is an admission of guilt to me, though we can continue this useless debate if you would like.”The widow was completely broken, defeated. “You don’t know what he was really like.” She shivered. “He was so cold, uncaring. But he wouldn’t let me get a divorce, no matter how many times I tried. S-so I did what I had to.”She couldn’t help herself as tears started rolling down her face, preparing herself for being arrested and sentenced to death.“I understand, (Y/N).” Namjoon said smoothly. One of his hands reached out to her, running over her cold fingers. “That’s why I’ll help you.”“What?”“We can keep this between us. This case will go unsolved.” Namjoon offered, giving her a warm, inviting smile as if he hadn’t just exposed her as a murderer. “I will only ask one thing of you.”“And what is that?” (Y/N) asked, her stomach flipping over in uneasiness.“Well, you’re a widow. I’m a single man. I think we could make each other very happy.”“With all due respect inspector-”“Namjoon.” He corrected“Namjoon, I just… can’t. I can’t just be in another relationship so quickly.” His smile dropped off of his face instantly.“So you’d rather spend your life in prison than with me?” He said threateningly. “(Y/N), I’m rich, I’m successful, I’m in love with you. I can treat you better than your former husband ever did. Just give me a chance.”Namjoon’s threat lingered in the air, (Y/N) choosing to take a sip of her lukewarm tea rather than respond to him.“I’ll give you until tomorrow afternoon to decide.” Namjoon said lowly, standing up. “If you haven’t given me a “yes” by Noon, I’ll put out a warrant for your arrest on suspicion of murder.”As he walked past her towards the door, one hand ran over her shoulder, as he leaned down to whisper into her ear.“Have a good day, my darling.” And with Namjoon gone, (Y/N) could finally breathe, yet with her predicament she knew the next twenty four hours would be her last taste of freedom.

            One more        This is the smut I said I was going to write the other day.Namjoon (not yandere that I can see)Warnings- pretty smutty. Forced orgasm, daddy kink, maybe a bit of ambiguous consent. I think that’s it.“Just one more baby, you can do it.” Namjoon cooed.  You turn your head to the side and wipe your sweat on the pillow.  “Uh-uh, I can’t. I don’t want to~” you wined breathlessly.  “Well I’m telling you, you will”  Namjoons large hands held your legs open as his head dipped between your thighs once again, “you always said nine was your lucky number” he mumbled into your pussy.  The friction was agony after the eight orgasms he has forced you to have already. You were spent after number three but namjoon wanted more, he licked and sucked at your clit aggressively, wanting to taste even more of you.   Keep reading

            Day 4 | Office Party        Synopsis: Namjoon is the office scrooge while you are always happy and jolly. But when you’ve had enough of his torment, you only give gifts to everyone else but him.The 12 Days of Black Christmas Event MasterlistPairing: Namjoon x Female ReaderAdmin: @chimchimsauce​Trigger warnings: sadism, physical violence, yandere-themes. ⊱ ────── {.⋅ ✯ ⋅.} ────── ⊰Namjoon’s eyes flick over to the clock hanging on the wall of his office, his heart beating quickly. Any minute now, YN will be here. The CEO pushes away from his desk and spins his chair in circles. He’s beyond excited. Not that he isn’t excited every time he sees the love of his life, but today is special.Today is the office holiday party and YN, as the newest team member and Namjoon’s personal assistant, was assigned to bring presents for everyone. Namjoon’s heart flutters just thinking about it. What will his sweet YN bring him? Undoubtedly it’ll be something he didn’t even know he wanted. YN’s so kind and considerate. It’s what gives him such pleasure making her life hell.At first, her ever-persistent smile irritated him to no end. Did she not understand how serious her job was? The firm they work at is one of the biggest in the entire country. There’s a tremendous amount of pressure on every employee’s shoulders, but somehow YN always smiled. Taking that smile away sent shivers of pleasure down Namjoon’s spine. It was a way to work off stress. Frequently, the elder would just snap at YN for no real reason, send tears sliding down her cheeks just because he could.But recently, Namjoon’s irritation has shifted to something else entirely. He often finds himself thinking of her for no apparent reason, even when he’s with prettier, richer women. Is this love? It must be!The sound of high heels clicking on the marble floor drags Namjoon out of his thoughts and causes him to rush to the door and peek his head out.“YN,” he says, hiding behind his mask of indifference, “You’re late.”“I apologize,” she says cooly, holding a cardboard box filled to the brim with small presents, “It took me longer to come up the stairs carrying this.”The box is so large, he can’t even see her face.Namjoon grins slightly. He forbid YN from using the elevator, even though his office is on the top floor.“You know I don’t tolerate excuses,” he says, taking his seat once more.YN gracefully finds her way to her too-small desk right next to Namjoon’s, sitting the box down beside her. She dives right into work, not sparing him another glance.The day seems to drag on forever to Namjoon. He barely gets anything done, always finding himself staring at the presents, dying to open his. Finally, after what feels like a millennium, the normal office day is over and it’s time for the Holiday Party.Namjoon stands by himself in the corner of the large conference room as his employees mull about and socialize, all giving him a wide breadth. No one ever talks to him unless absolutely necessary. He doesn’t mind. They’re all beneath him. The only person he wants attention from is YN.“Excuse me, everyone!” YN says, making herself the center of attention.Something about it unsettles Namjoon.“It’s time to open presents. I only got everyone something small, so please don’t be too disappointed.”Her eternal smile is brighter than the sun.Murmuring breaks out, everyone telling her that it’s okay.And with that, YN begins handing out presents. Namjoon pretends to be patient, but he taps his foot, wondering what’s taking her so long to give him his.“That’s everyone!” YN announces after giving the final employee their present. First, pure shock erupts through Namjoon before quickly being replaced with anger. Seeing red, Namjoon grabs YN by the wrist, yanking her into his office harshly, stunning everyone.“What are you-”The woman is slammed against the door of Namjoon’s office, her eyes wide with fear.“Do you think you’re clever, YN,” he asks, hands tightening against her skin with every second that passes, “You think you can just forget about me?! Dismiss me?!”YN is paralyzed with fright, completely terrified.“I’m the one in charge, YN, not you. Never forget that,”He lets go of her suddenly, YN’s legs giving out and leaving her a crumpled mess on the floor.“I’m a good boss. I deserve a present,”His smile is wicked and terrifying, looking more demon than man.“Since you failed to get one for me, I’ll pick it out myself,” he says, squatting down beside her, “I’ll take you for Christmas,”“W-what?” YN stutters out.“You’re mine now, YN-ah,” Namjoon says, twirling a lock of her hair around his finger, “Forever and always,”He yanks her hair harshly, watching as pain flits across her features.“I’ll ruin you like you’ve ruined me.”
