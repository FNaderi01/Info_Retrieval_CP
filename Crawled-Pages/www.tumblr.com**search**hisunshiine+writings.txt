You, his assistant, are new and bumbling and your mistakes, as well as your skirts, are driving him crazy.OR The one where Taehyung can’t survive without getting you out of your skirt.wc: 10,557warnings: smut. smut smut smut smut. a little bit of fluff because tae is fluffy. power dynamics, subtle dom!Tae/sub!reader (like blink and you miss it), unprotected sex (please practice safe sex), office sexual harassment (if this happens to you in real life please report them), lots of growling, spanking, fingering, edging, threat of orgasm denial, lite bondage (blink and miss it), “punishment”“Kim, report back to me after the 11 o'clock tomorrow.”The CEO’s voice was firm but quiet, not needing to be loud to command attention. CEO Kim Namjoon had recently taken over for his aging father, and Taehyung was thankful to be working under the younger man; the vibe in the office had shifted to one that was more relaxed, though still respectable.“Sir.” Kim Taehyung bowed his head before standing up from the large table, gathering his folders and the papers falling out of them, dismissed from the office after the morning briefing.Taehyung left the briefing room, walking down the hall to take the elevator down to return to his office, which was a beautiful glass windowed corner workplace. The elevator opened up to the 48th floor, and Taehyung stepped out.“Um, sir? Mr. Kim?” Your soft voice came from behind Taehyung as you followed him dutifully back towards his office. He paused his walk mid-stride, turning slowly to look back over his shoulder at you, an eyebrow raised into his blonde hair. He was tall, lean, and had the face of a model; easily the most attractive person you had ever had the pleasure of working under in your entire life. Keep reading

            |j.jk|Breakfast, No Bed 💦 🥰        AN: fluff, smut | oral (f receiving), unprotected sex, creampie, (sorry this is very vanilla)|*you know the deal, wrap it up, I am not responsible if you get pregnant*The counter in the dorms were covered in the pancake mix you accidentally spilt when you were pouring it into the oversized measuring glass. It was Chuseok, and the dorms were empty, just you and Jungkook were left before he was heading out to go home to Busan. You lived in Seoul, so you didn’t need to travel far to see your family for the holiday.“Shit,” you said, scooping the pancake mix across the counter into your other hand to dispose of in the garbage. Jungkook was still in bed, and you had wanted to surprise him with breakfast to hold his hungry ass over before he made the trip home.You dusted your hands on the oversized crewneck you were wearing– his of course. You loved to wear his clothes any chance you could, in this case, just the oversized sweater, nothing underneath. You didn’t want to make too much noise because it would ruin the surprise breakfast, and you hadn’t been able to find your panties in the dim morning light of his room from where he had discarded them sometime last night.You added the water to the powder mix, using a large fork to whisk the batter into a thicker consistency for cooking. You were so enthralled in the action of mixing that you didn’t notice the shadow approaching you.“Need some help?”Jungkook had padded into the kitchen, barefoot and only in grey sweatpants, hung low on his hips. His black hair was sticking up at odd angles, but cute, like his head had sprouted little hair stalks, while his elegant hands were balled into slight fists, rubbing at the sleep in his eyes. His voice, low from sleep sent shivers to your core. You could barely keep your eyes from staring at the shape of the V of his abs leading down into his grey pants. He walked up to you, stepping between the island and the counter where you were working on his meal.“You look like you’re struggling, but you look so cute like that,” Jungkook smiled sleepily at the face you were making, tongue poking out between your teeth as you struggled to whisk the now thick batter. You looked up at him, feigning a glare, as the batter had grown a bit more difficult to mix as it thickened. He came up behind you, wrapping you in his warmth as his hands wrapped around yours, one holding the bowl steady and the other holding onto the fork. His strong arms flexed as he helped you mix, getting all the leftover powder mixed in well.Once done, he let go of your hands, placing his palms on the edge of the counter, but still leaning onto your back. You turned around in the circle of his arms, tilting your head up to look at him, his face already angled towards you with his dark eyes meeting yours.“Morning,” you said shyly, always taken aback that this strong yet sensitive golden maknae was your man.He leaned down, his mouth capturing yours sweetly, mint toothpaste lingering on his tongue that teased at the crevice between your lips. He kept the kiss light and soft, like the sunlight streaming through the dewy windows, morning condensation clinging to the glass panes.“Mmm,” you let slip a quiet sigh, happiest when you were with him. He pulled back gently, lifting a hand to run his fingers through his bed head.“So, were you planning to surprise me?” he grins, wrinkling his nose cutely.“Yea, but you know, you kind of ruined that.” You poked your tongue out at him.“Brat.” He took his hand and dragged his finger across your cheek, leaving a line of pancake mix across your face.“Hey!” You frowned, furrowing your eyebrows at him as he stepped away from you to go to the sink behind him.You smirked, grabbing the yellow box of pancake mix to scoop a small amount into your palm.Jungkook didn’t feel the powder until it started to fall from his now white hair and onto his shoulders, dusting his golden shoulders.“You didn’t.” He turned to face you slowly, a playful glint in his eyes.You pretended to be innocent, making your eyes wide and doe-like, looking up into his face.“Didn’t what?” you asked, twirling your hair with your left hand, the flour covered hand hidden behind your back to avoid incriminating yourself.Jungkook reached a hand up to his head, feeling the flour as well as seeing it fall as he shook his locks with his fingers.“You are a bad, bad girl baby.”Jungkook lunged for the yellow box at the same time as you reached for it, causing the box to tilt over, spilling the mix onto the counter and floor. He didn’t miss a beat, grabbing handfuls to throw at your shocked face, taken back by the box spilling.The next few minutes was spent with the two of you laughing as you ducked and dodged flour; hiding behind the island in the kitchen, crawling along the floor, all the while tossing pancake mix at each other. Finally, out of flour mix, Jungkook sat with his back against the stove, in an attempt to hide as you crawled along the other side of the island. You saw he had no more flour ammo and moved quickly to entrap his face in your hands, rubbing the flour that was on your hands onto his cheeks.Both of you were breathing heavily as he stood, taking your hands to pull you up after him.“What a mess.” He looked around the kitchen, before his eyes rested on your face. “But what a beautiful mess it is.”You blushed, heat rising to your face as he continued to look at you in a way that felt like you were truly being seen.He closed the space between the two of you, lips enveloping yours, this time with a little less control than earlier. His hands moved from your hands to your waist, where he lifted you up and placed you on the countertop of the island. Your hands wrapped around his neck, feeling his pulse speed up as he kissed you longer. Jungkook moved closer, stepping between your legs as his hands moved to your exposed thighs, slowly running his fingers up them. He breached the hem of the crewneck and kept going, letting out a moan into your mouth when he felt that you didn’t have anything on underneath. His lips traced kisses down to your neck, and you shook your head slightly to move your hair out of his way, extending your neck to give him better access. He dusted wine colored love bites along your collarbone, marking you as his, as your body responded to him, hips rutting forward to find friction from his clothed member. Feeling you move, he pulled away, looking at your eyes lustfully as he dropped to his knees between your legs, never breaking eye contact. He pulled the crewneck up higher, sliding you closer to the edge of the counter so that he can taste you.As his lips touch your sensitive mound, he flicked his tongue to separate your lips so that he can suckle on your clit. You throw your head back, bucking your hips at the sensation, wanting to be closer to his warm mouth. He responds by devouring you, placing his mouth fully on you, tongue diving in and out of you as you squirm under his grip on your thighs. You look down between your legs to find he is already looking at you, getting turned on by your reaction to him. He languidly runs his tongue around your leaking core, avoiding your clit as you shiver, wanting pressure on your bud. He leans you backwards on the counter, pulling your thighs up, placing your calves on his shoulders. Jungkook took his hand and put it up by your face, his thumb pushing into your mouth. You sucked his thumb, your tongue swirling around and sucking as you continued rolling your hips further into his face before he removed his thumb and placed it on your clit, now that it was free of any pancake mix.“Fuck, baby f-fuck…” Your thighs trembled, and you could feel yourself circling higher until you fell apart, orgasm taking over your senses. Your hands that had tangled in his hair were now shoving at his head, trying to move him away from your oversensitive core.“Jung- fuck.. baby please, I can’t-” You moaned out, but he continued to lap at you, swallowing every drop of your slick that dripped out of you.You were a trembling mess when he stood to his full height, panting with eyes shut as you caught your breath from how hard you came. His presence disappeared and you heard more than saw the sink running, before Jungkook returned. He leaned down over you, bracing your arms around his neck to pick you up and carry you, legs wrapped around his waist. You heard the rustling of his sweatpants and then he lowered you both onto a dining room chair, his hard member touching your thigh. His hands slid up the sweater and to your waist, and you brought your lips to his, biting his full bottom lip as he hissed from the quick pain. You could taste yourself on his lips, his face still wet from his dive between your thighs. He gripped the hem of his crewneck, pulling it up and over your head, leaving you as naked as he was. His hard cock twitched, and using your toes, you lifted yourself so you could position him at your entrance.Slowly, you lowered yourself onto his throbbing member, letting him fill you completely.You moved slow, wanting to savor the feeling, your lips moving slow and sloppily as you consumed each other, his hands roaming your body at leisure. You rolled your hips, meeting slight thrusts, as his hands found purchase at your breasts, perky nipples rolling between his agile fingers.You moved your kisses to his jawline, hearing his gentle grunts every time he bottomed out in you, his musical moans lightning strikes to your heart. His head was tilted back, adam’s apple bobbing as he swallowed hard, arousal evident in the sounds he made.“Uh, mmm, huh,” he sighed out, with every thrust, the last one with a little more force, causing you to bite down on his neck. A shiver went through him, and you sucked at the skin on his neck, still tasting a minimal amount of the pancake mix that had clung to his glistening skin. You stopped bouncing on him, sitting fully on his muscular thighs to rut your sensitive clit against him. You went back to his lips, kissing him hard, wanting more of him, all of him, feeling insatiable. He picked you up, standing, his hands under your thighs so he could hold you as he began to thrust in and out of you. The head of his erection teased your g-spot, building you to your second orgasm. His eyes watched as your breasts bounced with every thrust, before dropping his lips to the swell of your breasts, leaving small love bites.“I’m gonna- fuck, I’m gonna cum babe.” Jungkook breathed into your neck as he pumped in and out of you.“Cum for me, please Jungkook,” you begged, wanting to feel him release his load into you. “Ah, like that baby, fill me with your seed, sh-shit,” you moaned.He moved towards the wall, pressing your back to it as he sped up, his thick thighs slapping against the bottoms of your own thighs, your hands pulling at the nape of his hair as you gasped from pleasure.“I’m- ahhh, I’m coming,” you breathed, walls contracting hard on his rigid dick, sending him to climax as well.You could feel him fill you up, and as he slowly pumped into you, milking it all inside of you, you pulled his hair to bring his face back to yours, your eyes on his beautiful face, lips red and puffy from kissing, eyes glassy and dilated, skin flushed a golden red tint from exertion. He took in your appearance as well, your maroon markings across your décolletage, skin with a sheen of sweat, your eyes hazy with love for him.Once he was empty, he pulled out of you and set you on your feet, though he didn’t let go of you, knowing how unsteady you would be from your double orgasms.“My bad, bad girl,” he said, looking down at you like you were the most interesting thing he had ever seen, “I think you need a shower. You’ve got flour all over you.”You smirked; eyes still low from the sated feeling of euphoria.“So do you, you dirty, dirty boy.”“Mmm, should we go take one together?” he asked, nuzzling his face into your neck. “Wash this breakfast off our skin?”You laughed, thinking about how breakfast in bed turned into breakfast, no bed.“I really wanted to surprise you with breakfast.” You pouted.“Oh baby, trust me, you are the best breakfast I could ask for. Plus, we still have the batter in the measuring cup if you’re actually hungry…”“Aka, you would love it if I finished making your surprise breakfast…”“If you insist.”Jungkook picks you up as you giggle, carrying you to the bathroom so you could clean up the mess you both had made on (and in) each other’s bodies, and make a few more messes while you were at it.끝MASTERLIST

He had been the new kid in tenth grade and had sat down at “your” table outside of the cafeteria. He had on a blue hat and a green shirt, the bold colors of his clothes caught your eye as you sat down with your lunch tray. You looked at him questioningly, and he introduced himself, “Kim Namjoon, I’m new here.”He had looked down, unable to hold eye contact with you for long, but when he glanced back up and smiled, he flashed the most beautiful dimples you had ever seen in your life. A quick salute, followed by a devastating smile that made his gorgeous half moon eyes disappear and you were a goner. Would have fallen to your knees had you not already lowered yourself onto the metal bench. Keep reading
