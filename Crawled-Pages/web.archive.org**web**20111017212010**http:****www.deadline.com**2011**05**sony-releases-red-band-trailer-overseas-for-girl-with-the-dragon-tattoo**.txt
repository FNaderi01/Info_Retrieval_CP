	    I hear the red band trailer for David Fincher’s Hollywood version of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo for Sony Pictures just debuted in Sweden and France today and is playing widely across the world this weekend and in select theaters in the U.S. Unfortunately, it’s not online yet, only in theaters. The green band version will launch next Thursday (June 2) online and widely in theaters next weekend.

			Just finished watching the trilogy. I am sure David Fincher did a good job but I feel kind of sorry for Rooney Mara. She is going to be compared to Noomi Rapace. Noomi’s portrayal of Lisbeth was iconic and I’m sure there are many young women with posters of her Lisbeth Salander adorning their bedroom walls.

			Following Noomi Rapace is like following Queen at Live Aid.

			Well said!!
			Comment by jake — Wednesday May 25, 2011 @ 3:28pm PDT  Reply to this post
			Yeah didnt think repace was that good looking forward to Rooney Mara

			Can’t wait! Let’s hope the international red band is released too. The trailer is an art itself, and working beyond strict parameters of a militant MPAA benefits greatly from more lenient standards.

			Cannot wait. Love Fincher after ‘Network’. ‘Tattoo’ will be a huge hit, for the older audience anyway.
			Comment by Gerard — Wednesday May 25, 2011 @ 9:59am PDT  Reply to this post
			the older audience already saw the original

			what film do we think it will be attached to?
			Comment by TT — Wednesday May 25, 2011 @ 10:21am PDT  Reply to this post
			Sony is not releasing anything this weekend so maybe it’s in front of Tree of Life? Since it says select US theaters. I doubt it’s in front of Hangover or Panda.
			Comment by Matthew Starr — Wednesday May 25, 2011 @ 10:33am PDT  Reply to this post
			Are they really keeping the Swedish names?
			Comment by ILDC — Wednesday May 25, 2011 @ 10:52am PDT  Reply to this post
			I mean, let’s be honest here, the Swedish films weren’t that amazing. Yes, Noomi did a terrific job, but that’s about it. Rooney’s going to be fantastic.
			Comment by Rena — Wednesday May 25, 2011 @ 11:24am PDT  Reply to this post
			It’ll be attached to Hangover II.  And it’s AMAZING.
			Comment by BadHatHarry — Wednesday May 25, 2011 @ 11:51am PDT  Reply to this post
			Excellent book. Really looking forward to the film!
			Comment by Tanya — Wednesday May 25, 2011 @ 12:07pm PDT  Reply to this post
			I’ll agree the Swedish sequels weren’t the best, but neither were the books.  I actually think the Swedish filmmakers improved upon the excesses of The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet’s Nest.  But the first one directed by Nils Oplev?  Fincher will bring more style and an auteur’s eye to the story, but I don’t know if he can do it better.  I feel sorry for Rooney, because no matter what nominations she’ll get, she will always be compared to Noomi Rapace’s amazing work.
			Comment by Raine — Wednesday May 25, 2011 @ 12:08pm PDT  Reply to this post
			If its red band, then theaters can only play it in front of an R rated movie…and there’s only one big R rated movie opening this weekend. Kind of an odd pairing though.
			Comment by dinovelvet — Wednesday May 25, 2011 @ 12:27pm PDT  Reply to this post
			ya know the more i think about it putting it with H-O2 makes sense. Dudes and more dudes for a film with what they will see as Bond running around with a smart hot chic. That works.
			Comment by TT — Wednesday May 25, 2011 @ 2:01pm PDT  Reply to this post
			Yes, Mara will be compared to Rapace but I’m looking forward to the remakes and think they will do well. I know a lot of people were offended by the idea of a remake, but it’s been good for Rapace’s career too. I’d never heard of this book series until all of the controversy surfaced over the movie re-make.  I read the books and rented the Swedish versions of these movies because of all the press surrounding the remake.  As a result, I now follow Rapace’s career because I thought she gave a good performance. Everyone involved with this franchise should see this remake as a financial/career boost for anyone involved with the previous films.
			Comment by JR — Thursday May 26, 2011 @ 11:45am PDT  Reply to this post
			Saw a leaked redband trailer today. The scenes I saw were exactly like the ones in the original. The American casting is spot on except for Mara. I’m hoping her performance makes up for the styling and look of her character.
