    Summary
      ~“Thank you.” Remus ran a hand through his soaked curls. “Sirius, I-” Come on, Lupin. “I-” Remus walked in, past Sirius, and shut the door. “Sirius, I- Can I kiss you? I’ve wanted to kiss you again for an eternity.”Sirius stuttered a little, and dragged a hand over his face. “Remus?! What-” he put his hands on his hips, his cheeks a little flustered. “What?!”“Oh my fucking God. I ruined it.”~Remus Lupin is a 27 year old junior-associate at lawfirm Slughorn &amp; Fortescue. For three years, his hard work and dedication have gone unnoticed. He lives in a shabby flat, with mountains of student loans, and has already accepted his fate of being stuck in his little cubicle forever when senior partner, and court-room legend, Kingsley Shacklebolt calls him up to his office. Remus then meets Sirius Black, the embodiment of beautify and grace, and from that moment on his life changes. He gets to work with the big-shots, and prove his worth as a lawyer. Although... However his plea against work-place relationships and too handsome men may be, he can't help but fall for his boss' secretary. **WEEKLY UPDATES **

    Summary
      There was always the underlying fear that something would go wrong, that one of us would slip up. We had never expected it to happen so soon. It was the night of the full moon and everything had been going almost according to plan, except the fact that Sirius was late. The moon was almost at it’s highest when Sirius came bursting through the door, he desperately tried to change into Padfoot. But he was paralyzed in fear, because he stood before a monster. It’s gnarly jaws snapped at him and it’s heady breath wafted into his face. He turned to run, a desperate attempt to escape the threat of death that surely looked above him. But he was much to slow, the monster pounced on his back and pinned him to the rotting floor. He cried out but was quickly silenced when the beast sunk its teeth into the sensitive flesh of his neck. The beast snarled and growled as he struggled against it’s hold but there’s no use. He can already sense the reaper lurking in the corners, waiting for him to take his last breath. “Please” he mutters with his final breath, before the world goes dark.

    Summary
      Harry like usual is caught up in everything. Fourth Year turns out to be one of the best years he's had (read: the worst). It gave him the opportunity to be himself, for once he wasn't living up to anyone else's standards. He makes new friends and finds a few truths that shouldn't have been hidden from him. Of course, anxiety and trauma decide that they won't be leaving him alone.

    Summary
      Sanctum Sanctorum - the holiest of holy places. A very private or highly secret place or area of activity.Around two years ago, the laws in America changed. It is illegal to exist in the country as an adult without being registered as an owner, or as property. Other countries have been protesting the bizarre laws since they were first proposed, and things are quickly changing in the country since they were passed.Sirius Black, newly famous lead singer of the rock band Grimm, keeps a lot of secrets. No one knows he's trans, no one knows he's gay, and no one in the world knows that he's a submissive. Well, apart from Remus Lupin, a wealthy young fetish company owner and dominant he met at a party in LA four years ago. A dominant who he's been talking to secretly ever since, and a dominant who Sirius wants nothing more than to be owned by.When Sirius suddenly leaves home and flies to the states without telling anyone, no one understands why. But Sirius's life is about to get far more interesting than he's ever dreamed.
