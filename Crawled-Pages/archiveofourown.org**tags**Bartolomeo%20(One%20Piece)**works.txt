    Summary
      1. Law soothes the wounded ego of his crew and the Straw hats crew by making origami flowers out of bounty posters and lives (just) to tell the tale to Marco. Some bounty posters and Bartolomeo's pride were injured in the making of this tale. (full/main one shot)2. Marco and Law talk about Ace. pre Law/Ace not Mar/Law—ficlet3. Law and Killer and then Killer and Kid talk about ships—can be read platonicallyLink to index.Origami Mana Re-uploaded and backdated, hence the low stats. 2 and 3 are new works.

Luffy he just wants to be king of the pirates Doflamingo needs therapy Lots and lots of therapy Dubious Consent Fluff Lust at First Sight overfed snails
    Summary
      Doflamingo wasn't expecting much when he has to stay on an island for a bit because of major storms. Instead of a nice relaxing time off like he was expecting he ends up with a baby to raise. One that's going to require a hell of a lot more responsibility and patience than he or his crew ever expected to have to deal with! He isn't really sure how he ended up with such a defiant hyper spaz of a brat, but he loves him anyways and can't stand even the thought of him ever leaving! Much to his annoyance someone's been filling his baby's head with stories about pirate kings and adventure. Now his Luffy was hell bent on becoming pirate king!
When Luffy finally does manage to run off he ends up making far larger a name for himself than Doflamingo ever wanted, catching the attention of handsome guys far and wide. 
Not only does he have to keep Luffy from wandering off on him he needs to make sure his beloved Crocodile understands that they are just so right for each other! How can't he see that they were perfect for one another? Why was his beloved family always being so difficult? They acted like, him wanting their constant love and them to never leave him, was unreasonable or something! It was ridiculous!
