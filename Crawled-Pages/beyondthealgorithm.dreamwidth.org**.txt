Rules, Schedule, IntroOct. 9th, 2020 03:16 pm
beyondthealgorithm_modHello and welcome to Beyond the Algorithm! If you are tired of inaccurate computer-generated recommendations, this may be an event for you. In Beyond the Algorithm, participants will receive at least two personalized recommendations for new canons to try out. This is a fest inspired by crossing over reccing comms like recthething and fancake, and giftbox-style events like fandomgiftbox and fandom_stocking. Some of the rules, particularly regarding fills, have been adapted from fandomgiftbox's ruleset. ( Rules )( Schedule )
