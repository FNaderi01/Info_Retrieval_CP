                 Mini Bio
                A wanna-be writer with a fascination for the unexplained. Spends most of her time doodling, "thinking out loud" (ie, talking to herself), looking up useless information, and imagining she's famous. Also enjoys writing about herself in the third person and, for some reason, making herself appear to be slightly insane.She leads a rather boring life, so she often embellishes the stories of her day. She also has a tendency to let out the characters running rampant in her head, allowing them to post every once in a while.Friending info n stuff This journal is seme-friends only. My fics are public and everything else isn't. I'm pretty chill about it, though. Feel free to add me, no strings attached. And if I add you, don't feel obligated to return it.
