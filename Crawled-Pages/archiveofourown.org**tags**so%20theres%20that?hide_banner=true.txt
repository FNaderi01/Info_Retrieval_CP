    Creator Chose Not To Use Archive WarningsHarry Styles/Louis TomlinsonHarry Styles Louis Tomlinson Liam Payne Niall Horan Oli Wright Julian Bunetta Original Female Character(s)Breaking Up &amp; Making Up Fluff and Angst Angst with a Happy Ending Angst ok i know i excessively tagged the angst but like YIKES So much angst enough to exceed three tags worth but i PROMISE this one has a happy ending so just suffer thru also this kinda started out as a songfic for somebody else by the 1975 but it morphed into something a bit different hence the title being from can't help falling in love so theres that eh whatever just read it if you want
    Summary
  "What will hit me?" Louis snapped, taking two steps off the wall towards the opposing man. "That you were a waste of my time?""No, that I am," Harry said simply. "I am a waste of time-- a massive one. I will waste all of your precious time, every single moment until your very last breath is wasted on me, and you'll die hoping that Heaven is made of the fabric of my t-shirt that you never gave back." He took another step forward. He was only a breath away, the colors of his eyes separating into green and gold from where Louis stood. "It will hit you and you will realize that it's me," he said, smiling at Louis in the eye of the storm, eerily calm in the wake of mass destruction. "It's always been me."
or the one where harry makes a promise and stays true to his word but maybe he'll change his mind.

    Summary
      Like what the title says, its a bunch of self indulgent writings. That includes me throwing my two Overwatch Oc's into relationships with canon characters, and, ya know, some more of the popular ships *cough*McHanzo*cough*. I literally have no self control. So, enjoy these writings from my mind. Also, it's rated teen and up due to some swearing and some content that may or may not pop up.

Fluff extra character: the fae in brooke brooke is essentially part water fae!! i love my daughter she needs more love also uhm warning the fae is kinda a dick as most fae are bc theyre of the opinion theyre above mortals and also kinda self centered so theres that but they care for brooke!! just in a very fae way rich jake and jenna have lines but theyre not as important as the others!! this is brooke centric and i love her so much Pining POV Third Person Limited bc thats all i write in Pining Brooke Pining Michael Playride but yeah enjoy!! i fixed a few grammar and tense errors too!! i kinda edited this so its playride now but hey follow ur dreams kids
    Summary
      Brooke knew her whole life she'd been on a no-salt fad diet her mother advocated for because her whole family had allergic reactions to salt, and thought that was normal. I mean, plenty of families couldn't eat salt because of random, long forgotten heritage to some supernatural being. She never thought it was because she was fae, though.She supposes she was wrong.

      "It started with some sort of commotion related to confessions."
In the Neath, there is no such thing as predictability. Sometimes the best and most interesting relationships can blossom out of the most meaningless encounters. This is one of those stories.

    Summary
      "Do you know why people come from the furthest corners of the world to come here?" Aurora asks. She takes an apple in her hand and plucks it off the branch. Without waiting for an answer from Castor, she continues. "It's because they fear death. The uncertainty scares them." She holds out the apple. "And you know what this does."
"It prolongs life." But it's much more than that. It can make the fear seem less real. By pushing it back they can forget for a short time that there was anything to fear at all. It can give them power. Makes them think they're invincible for out-smarting death. It can give them hope. Hope that maybe they can use the extra time to change something, that the world will be a little better when they do leave.
For these golden apples do give people a sense of immortality, eating one can also give something far more precious: possibilities.

    Summary
      Christmastime was always special for Bruce and Selina. They first met around Christmas, discovered one another’s true identities, and made the bold choice to start their lives together around Christmas. Selina almost walked away. She was the one saying hours earlier “does this mean we have to start fighting?” The look on her face from then on broke Bruce’s heart. He wanted to make things work. He knew they could both be better for it.This is the first of a series of one sets based off the premise that Selina chose to go with Bruce and try to make a life with him. These will not be in chronological order but will all be interrelated.

    Summary
      If you slap a jester's hat on the monster in the closet it ceases to be scary but to itself, it will still be a monster. If Jeongguk opens his palms he closes them instantly because he doesn't like the ugliness he sees. The neon light leaks through his pores and he ceases to be bright.Pain changes people. It certaintly changes Jeon Jeongguk.
