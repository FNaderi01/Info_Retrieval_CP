TSLint
‚ö†Ô∏è TSLint is deprecated.
See this issue for more details: Roadmap: TSLint ‚Üí ESLint. If you're interested in helping with the TSLint/ESLint migration, please check out our OSS Fellowship program.
TSLint is an extensible static analysis tool that checks TypeScript code for readability, maintainability, and functionality errors. It is widely supported across modern editors &amp; build systems and can be customized with your own lint rules, configurations, and formatters.
TSLint currently supports:
an extensive set of core rules
custom lint rules
custom formatters (failure reporters)
inline disabling and enabling of rules with comment flags in source code
configuration presets (tslint:latest, tslint-react, etc.) and plugin composition
automatic fixing of formatting &amp; style violations
integration with MSBuild, Grunt, Gulp, Atom, Eclipse, Emacs, Sublime, Vim, Visual Studio 2015, Visual Studio 2017, Visual Studio code (alternative: use this extension for TS &lt;3.2), WebStorm and more
Installation &amp; Usage
Please refer to the full installation &amp; usage documentation on the TSLint website. There, you'll find information about
configuration,
core rules,
core formatters, and
customization of TSLint.
inline disabling and enabling of rules with comment flags
TSLint Playground
There is a sandbox environment for TSLint at palantir.github.io/tslint-playground, which can be used to test rules and see how TSLint works. Issues can be filed against tslint-playground here.
Custom Rules &amp; Plugins
Custom rule sets from Palantir
tslint-react - Lint rules related to React &amp; JSX.
tslint-blueprint - Lint rules to enforce best practices with blueprintjs libraries
Custom rule sets from the community
If we don't have all the rules you're looking for, you can either write your own custom rules or use rules implementations developed by the community. The repos below are a good source of custom rules:
ESLint rules for TSLint - Improve your TSLint with the missing ESLint Rules
tslint-microsoft-contrib - A set of TSLint rules used on some Microsoft projects
codelyzer - A set of tslint rules for static code analysis of Angular TypeScript projects
vrsource-tslint-rules
tslint-immutable - TSLint rules to disable mutation in TypeScript
tslint-consistent-codestyle - TSLint rules to enforce consistent code style in TypeScript
tslint-sonarts - Bug-finding rules based on advanced code models to spot hard to find errors in TypeScript
tslint-clean-code - A set of TSLint rules inspired by the Clean Code handbook
rxjs-tslint-rules - TSLint rules for RxJS
