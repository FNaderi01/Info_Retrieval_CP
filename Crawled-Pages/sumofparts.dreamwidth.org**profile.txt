                 Mini Bio
                I'm on LJ at sumofparts.This journal is being used primarily for reading and commenting. My posts are public (and mostly for the 50books_poc/50books_poc challenge or otherwise) so I probably won't be formally granting access. Subscribe as you see fit.I'm also on Goodreads here.
