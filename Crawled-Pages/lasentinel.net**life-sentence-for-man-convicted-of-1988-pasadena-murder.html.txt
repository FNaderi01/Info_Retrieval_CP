Life Sentence for Man Convicted  of 1988 Pasadena Murder            
				By Sentinel News Service                
	                	                Published October 12, 2018
		A 56-year-old man was sentenced today to 32 years to life in state prison for the murder of a jewelry salesman at a Pasadena gas station more than three decades ago, the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office announced.
Deputy District Attorney Ryan Erlich said Albert Ahmad Clark aka Al Clark was found guilty on Nov. 13, 2017, of one count of first-degree murder with an allegation that he personally used a handgun in the commission of the crime.
On Feb. 27, 1988, victim Leroy Galloway, 39, was selling jewelry out of his van while parked at a gas station on Lake Avenue and Orange Grove Boulevard, the prosecutor said. According to evidence presented at the trial, Clark killed Galloway by shooting him multiple times.
        ADVERTISEMENT        
The defendant was arrested and charged with the murder in 1988 but a year later the case was dismissed due to then-existing limitations on forensic science.
In 2013, an extensive examination of the case file by Pasadena police homicide detectives identified items of evidence that were suitable for modern forensic analysis.
Evidence presented at trial indicated that Clark was one of Galloway’s customers and he had contacted Galloway multiple times in the weeks preceding this incident, including the day before Galloway’s death.
Case GA097658 was investigated by the Pasadena Police Department.
