Icon RequestWould anyone be interested in making me an icon for The Untamed?  In the scene at the secret cold pond LanZhan plays the first notes on the ancient Qin and we get an amazing image of him, white robes floating about him, against a blue background.  Is anyone willing to find a screenshot and make that for me?   I don't write love scenes but would be willing to exchange for a drabble of your choice.

Okay, 90% sure.

Playing with Photoshop - Lan ZhanI made a bannerish bit of Photoshop art playing with the beautiful Lan Zhan.Click on this thumbnail to see the full size at my webpage.Apologies for my broken layout there if you see it. I'm getting around to repairs.Further back you can see my Tolkien based banner and artwork.I'm hooked on 'The Untamed' now, so looking to make more art and banner commissions in my free time.Apologies - I forgot to change the access on this. It's unlocked now.

Fic: Seasons in the SunTitle: Seasons in the SunFandom: Mo Dao Zu Shi / The Untamed &amp; Buffy the Vampire SlayerRating: GeneralRelationships: Jiang Cheng / Cordelia Chase (eventually)Characters (in this scene): Jiang Cheng, Wei WuxianTiming: Post Canon Edit: I can't believe I forgot the link. Story is here. Snippet: When Jiang Cheng finally found him, Wei Wuxian, dressed in his  ever-present black with a red ribbon tying his long black hair up into a  messy bun, was squatting by a small pool, poking a stick into the  water. “Why am I not surprised to find you stirring up mud?”Wei  Wuxian looked up with a wide grin. Jiang Cheng blinked back his  surprise. How could the man look so happy when he didn’t want to be  here?“Jiang Cheng, there was a toad, but now I can’t find it.”“It  was probably scared off by your ugly face.” Jiang Cheng scowled at his  own words. He’d meant to be nice. “Are you joining me for dinner or  not?”“Is it that late?”It hadn’t been when Jiang Cheng had started looking for him. “Almost.”Wei Wuxian tossed the stick away as he rose to his feet. “Okay.”Jiang  Cheng started walking back, only rolling his eyes when his back was  turned to his brother. He shouldn’t have gone looking for Wei Wuxian.  He’d bet a thousand pieces of gold that Lan fucking Wangji never had to  hunt him down for dinner.Wei Wuxian caught up and draped an arm  across Jiang Cheng’s shoulder. “Do you think there’ll be lotus soup?  I’ve missed it in Gusu.”Of course they’d serve lotus soup. Did  Wei Wuxian think his own brother had forgotten his favorite dishes?  Jiang Cheng shrugged but not enough to disturb the arm draped over his  shoulder. “How would I know?”
