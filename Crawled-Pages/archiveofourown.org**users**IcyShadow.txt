    Summary
      In a world where soulmates are individuals connected on a spiritual level, able to communicate with variable degrees of empathy or telepathy, there is an appropriate time and rhythm for everything, even for a soulbond.Yuuri knows this. Viktor will learn.

    Summary
      "Well, I never was very good at subtlety." Viktor straightened up into perfect, formal posture and looked Yuuri directly in the eye. "I should reintroduce myself. My name is Viktor Katsuki-Nikiforov, and I've come back in time to save your life."

    Summary
      When Yuuri and Viktor wake up decades in the past, they don't know what to do. Does the other remember them, or are they doomed to try and recreate the relationship they were always meant to have?Luckily that particular question is quickly answered and resolved, but even then, there are obstacles in their way. The most important? Yuuri is only 14 now, hardly a good age for them to announce a relationship between the two of them, even if they keep it age-appropriate. So for the time being, they'll have to try and settle for long-distance.But it's hardly realistic to expect them to be able to react normally after their lives were completely messed up by this whole 'time travel' thing, and really, who can blame them for not being able to convincingly play the age (and maturity level) the rest of the world still expects of them? NOTE: As those of you who read the original version of this story as I was posting it probably noticed, I really rushed through it. After coming up with a whole bunch of things that I wanted to add to it that would've stood out if I added them so late, I decided to try my hand at re-writing the whole thing. I'm going to try not to rush it so much this time. Enjoy!

    Creator Chose Not To Use Archive WarningsKatsuki Yuuri/Victor Nikiforov Otabek Atlin/Yuri Plisetsky (when older)Katsuki Yuuri Victor Nikiforov Yuri Plisetsky Otabek Altin Phichit ChulanontFluff Domestic Fluff M rating for thematic content in places nothing graphic I just love Yurio as their angry kitten son ok? My headcanon is that Victor's wealthy as shit but never talks about it Unconditional Love i'm not crying you're crying Also headcanon that Victor never gets over the fact that Yuuri beat him to proposing this is less 'how to parent?!' and more 'how to son??!?'
    Summary
      Victor had started it.  It was his fault in the end then, though he knew Yuuri took responsibility as well.  And he couldn't even blame it on being so ridiculously, goddamn in love with his husband that he sometimes got the urge to adopt every cute little thing in sight to increase their family.No, this stretched back farther than that.  Back to the empty halls and cavernous rooms of his own childhood.  Back to the beginnings of loneliness and of the few things he purposefully lets himself forget.And now Yurio, strong, fierce, Yurio, was sobbing against him with a startling intensity, and it was all Victor's fault.
