    Summary
      In June of 1980, Voldemort successfully took control of the Magical Ministry. For eleven years, Magical Britain was finally at peace, only a few rebels fighting against the New Ministry. Voldemort stepped out of the limelight after the end of the war, choosing instead to focus on something important: His sonInferius. A four year old Inferius who goes by the name 'Little One' and is completely adored by everyone who meets him. But Little One holds a lot of mysteries. Who is he? How did he die? But most pressing, what is his relationship to the Dark Lord?
Everything is fine, of course, until the Order decide to take Little One away from a very protective and possessive Dark Lord.
And somehow, that is the least of the Dark Lord's problems. Add one clingy, annoying Death and one all-seeing, secretive Fate and you might just have a story!
Follow Voldemort as he struggles through protecting his child, fighting off a very persistent Death, running an entire country, and for Merlin's saKE CAN HE PLEASE BEAT FATE AT ONE BLOODY GAME OF CHESS?????
[Very OOC and not a Tomarry/Harrymort. Recently changed summary, same story!]

    Summary
      In preparation for the upcoming war, Severus is persuaded by Dumbledore to enter into a magical bond with Sirius and Remus. "A bond between two is strong, but a triad bond can help you reach depths of magic rarely explored before. Even more importantly, I knew that you and Sirius alone would not be able forgo the past and cooperate peacefully. A mediator would be necessary, someone to ease the process. Naturally, that person has to be Remus. The creation of a triad bond requires an ancient and powerful inclination, which will only be strengthened by the history of your acquaintance, by the way your faiths have intertwined with each other through the years, by the depth of emotion that has been shared between you three."

    Summary
      Harry like usual is caught up in everything. Fourth Year turns out to be one of the best years he's had (read: the worst). It gave him the opportunity to be himself, for once he wasn't living up to anyone else's standards. He makes new friends and finds a few truths that shouldn't have been hidden from him. Of course, anxiety and trauma decide that they won't be leaving him alone.

      It had been a year since Peace among the Wizards and the Magical creatures finally came after so long. Only Dumbledore wasn't satisfied, will he ever be? Attacking an innocent party to get what he wants, can nothing stop him? how about the greed of another so strong it rewrites history. Join Harrison and Co. as they struggle to grow up.This is the mixing of Checkmate you Lose, I want a Rematch and It's Wizard's Chess. I do not own anything, Harry Potter, only an idea I had a long time ago. J.K.Rowling is the owner of the Harry Potter universe and characters.There is a lot of Guy x Guy. off and on Beta'dThis is a Slow burn.

    Summary
      Harry Potter grew up knowing no love. Beatings were given to him daily, along with the long list of chores that no child should have to do alone.Harry Potter never went to Hogwarts when his first year came around. Nor did he go when is was supposed to be his second or third. Only when he is fourteen, someone comes for him.But Harry Potter was never the Boy-Who Lived in the first place.He was only the brother.

    Summary
      Había pasado 1 semana desde que Severus Snape había salido de vacaciones y hoy se encontraba al borde de la muerte en un sucio hospital muggle mientras que su madre había muerto gracias a un mal golpe que le dio Tobías.Todo su cuerpo dolía y en medio de la inconsciencia y la claridad pudo darse cuenta que se encontraba rodeado de doctores que lo estaban conectando a máquinas extrañas, pero eso poco valía, ya que su vista poco a poco se iba desenfocando y oscureciendo hasta que todo su alrededor se puso de color negro.

    Summary
      'I don’t remember ever being this tired.' Severus Snape is exhausted, he's tired of the life he leads and the people around him. He would do anything to kill the pain, anything. Even if it meant brewing a highly illegal potion and accidentally falling in love with a werewolf and an alcohol addict.
