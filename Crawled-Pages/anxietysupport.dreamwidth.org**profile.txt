                 Mini Bio
                Welcome to anxietysupport! This community was made for anyone who experiences frequent anxiety of any degree or has an anxiety disorder diagnosis (panic attacks, social anxiety, agoraphobia, etc). Open discussions, requests for advice, and sharing of experiences are encouraged! Chances are you're very much not alone. Since the purpose of this community is to discuss anxiety, entries containing details about anxiety attacks and anxiety-inducing situations do not need to be placed behind cuts. This community is not what some might know as a "safe space" community; members are responsible for their own triggers. Unless an entry contains explicit material (covered under the Guidelines), it is acceptable within this community. GuidelinesStay On Topic: This is an anxiety community so please keep discussions related to anxiety as much as possible. Posting daily events are fine as long as the content ties into anxiety, for example: I had this happen to me and now I'm really anxious. If the event that happened to you is beyond scary? That brings us to the next rule:Place anything explicit beneath a cut with a warning. Explicit subjects include a.) abuse b.) rape c.) self-harm d.) suicidal ideation. (If you think of another explicit topic that should be added to this list please PM a moderator.) Some guidelines for members to follow when deciding whether or not to place an entry behind a cut with a warning:Is it graphic? Does it go into explicit detail? Could it be triggering to others, especially entries about suicide and self-injury?Advertising another community is allowed, provided that the community is directly related to anxiety and disorders that tend to go along with it. Examples: depression, manic-depression, ADD, ADHD, PTSD, OCD, bipolar disorder, addiction problems, IBS, parenting with anxiety, school and anxiety, etc. Please make advertisements non-invasive! If you want to post pictures, ads, banners or videos, please place them under a cut with a short description.Respect is important so be polite. Fighting will not be tolerated. Respectful disagreement is different than fighting. Whenever you feel a strong surge of negative emotion toward another poster, it's a good indicator that things are getting too personal. Stop. Sit on your hands. Take the disagreement elsewhere. If you have a problem with an entry made by another member contact a mod first, don't take matters into your own hands.Affiliates / related communitiesphases - a community for people who identify or have been diagnosed as having a bipolar spectrum disorder.selfhelp_support_resource - fictive &amp; empowered plural-friendly community for self-help resources &amp; supportThis isn't a therapy or medical community. If you feel there is something very wrong, please contact a family member or a professional.
