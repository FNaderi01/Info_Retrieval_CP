            PBS tapped The Atlantic to raise awareness for and generate interest in the sophomore season of its historical drama, Mercy Street. By leveraging overlooked and forgotten aspects of the Civil War—the show's setting—the campaign, with a custom article as its centerpiece, resonated with fans of history and entertainment alike and the inquisitive Atlantic audience.

              The bloodiest war in U.S. history is a popular area of study for historians and hobbyists alike, but some stories do remain untold. Re:think shone a light on one event in particular: a hard-fought battle for which 14 African-American soldiers received the Medal of Honor. The in-depth article detailed the Battle of New Market Heights, the controversy surrounding it, and how such a dramatic turn of events could have faded to the background over the past century and a half.

            The Work Behind the Work
            We partnered with Millward Brown to create a comprehensive executive study on how businesses can adjust to multiple changes in the marketplace and embody them at once—on how leaders are “getting to &amp;.” This positioned AT&amp;T as a thought leader in cybersecurity, agility, and customer satisfaction: The traits we found necessary for business success. In addition to creating a downloadable PDF whitepaper of the results, we produced three, richly-reported articles on each business consideration.      
            Native Content
              The articles--on cybersecurity, agility, and customer satisfaction--explored how modern businesses could embody those traits and more without making sacrifices in other departments. This approach allowed us an opportunity to offer qualitative analysis about the business considerations we discovered and the different solutions being used by real companies to address them.

            The Work Behind the Work
            In 2016, Boeing turned 100 years old. To help the aviation giant celebrate this milestone, Re:think designed a high-impact campaign highlighting Boeing's contributions to flight throughout history. An ambitious interactive photo gallery chronicled the past century of aviation, while three elegant, custom infographics explored Boeing's effects on the diverse worlds of space exploration, international travel, and disaster relief.      
            Native Content
              First, we built a dynamic, scrolling photo gallery: 'Century in the Sky' dove into the way the aerospace industry has affected the way we travel, move our goods, and protect our nations during times of war. Pivotal moments for both Boeing and aviation in general were featured in the gallery, which also featured text write-ups of the events in question.
Then, in a series of sleek and striking infographics, Re:think celebrated Boeing's contributions in three distinct areas. First, we explored the role Boeing would play in space exploration thanks to the groundbreaking Space Launch System; then, we quantified the disaster relief efforts aided by Boeing's cargo workhorse, the C-17 Globemaster; and finally, we illustrated how innovation has advanced passenger air travel over the years, a look at the longest commercial flight routes in history.

To bring attention to a lesser-known method of clothing disposal, we combined influencer presence, beautiful visuals, and explored the sentimental value of clothes to frame garment recycling as a more humane and more responsible way to dispose of old clothing.      
            Native Content
              Musician Jon Batiste, artist Jodi Steele, and jewelry designer Candice Pool shared the stories of each of their favorite garments, and why they would rather recycle them than throw them out.

            The Work Behind the Work
            Lincoln came to The Atlantic when they looked to raise awareness about the launch of the luxury Continental. We wanted to frame the model as adventurous, detail-oriented, off-the-beaten-path, but still premium, and landed on the concept of "Outposts," emerging neighborhoods right outside of city centers that are surfacing on people's cultural radars. Our team visited two such neighborhoods to create two experiences that showed the reader the unique, fascinating cultures of lesser-known neighborhoods that should be destinations in their own right.      
            Native Content
              Two experiences--one focusing on Sunset Park in New York and one on Pilsen, Chicago--highlighted the people, places, and history that defined the neighborhood in question. With beautiful custom photography, a food-leaning focus, and researched reporting about local history, we combined a travel sensibility with informative descriptions.            
            Video
              This program included four custom videos that were embedded in the features. In Sunset Park we spoke with Irwin, a man who has lived in the neighborhood his whole life and now runs a local cafe with his family, and Bri, a woman who was working in real estate but began wood-working full time in an artist studio complex in Sunset Park. In Pilsen we spoke with Mary, a resident who opened a beautiful community bookstore to give back to the neighborhood, and Ruben, a Chicago native who paints stunning public murals in Chicago neighborhoods (especially Pilsen) to make locals rethink their community.

            The average American spends 90% of his or her life indoors. Dyson is a leading force behind making sure the air you breathe during that time is safe. To help them own the air quality conversation, we launched a collaboration called "The Air We Breathe," a 360-degree campaign anchored by an event on Earth Day 2017, attended by over 150 industry executives, including world-renowned experts and policymakers. We also crafted a custom article, a livestream of the event, and compelling, complementary digital media.

            Event
              We created a dedicated landing page for The Clean Air Summit—hosted on TheAtlantic.com, which was home to a livestream of the event and detailed information about the event before and after it happened to help extend the discussion.

            The Work Behind the Work
            To lift the perception that Fidelity Investments is a company with smart investor insights and compelling points of view, The Atlantic partnered with Fidelity Investments to create our first-ever branded podcast. The Future According to Now challenged the assumptions of today’s market and our future to present a unique sense of the opportunities of today that are affecting the outcomes of tomorrow.      
            Native Content
              When we talk of innovation and emerging technologies, we often paint a vivid picture of the world three, four, five decades out.  But when we look too far ahead, several questions are often overlooked.  What does this innovation mean for today?  What real-world innovation is being implemented right now?
The  Future According to Now uncovered specific stories of what’s happening today - tied to the fields of biotechnology, big data, manufacturing, and the Internet of Things - and connected big themes with current projects and immediate implications.            
            Print
              To promote the custom branded podcast, Fidelity Investments ran print executions in the July/August, September, and November issues of The Atlantic Monthly.            
            Brand Study
              To measure the impact of Fidelity's branded podcast, we conducted a brand study. As a result of the study, we found that the podcast helped increase brand recall and consideration intent for Fidelity.

            In May 2017, AtlanticLIVE—the events division of The Atlantic—hosted over 200 thought leaders in the field of space and extraterrestrial travel for a thought-provoking one-day event in Washington D.C. Underwritten exclusively by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, this event featured a diverse lineup of world-renowned speakers (including Senator Ted Cruz and executives from NASA and The Mars Society, among others) and explored the challenges, technologies, and potential impact of the current space race.      
            Event
              The event was live-streamed across the globe via dedicated event landing page on TheAtlantic.com. Social media promotion and amplification strategies were highly effective—#AtlanticSpace, the Twitter hashtag for the event, was trending on Twitter in Washington D.C. during the event, with over 2,000 mentions.

            Urban revitalization is one of the core goals at Prudential—a company that believes buying, living, and hiring local are essential elements of a thriving city. To develop awareness of Prudential's ongoing efforts in ushering in the revival of Newark (where they were founded in 1875), the Re:think team executed a custom content campaign celebrating “anchor” institutions in urban communities: Hospitals, universities, and forward-thinking businesses that infuse jobs, money and involved citizens into cities.      
            Native Content
              We captured the faces and voices behind the city’s revival in 5 richly reported custom articles that lived on a dynamic custom content hub on TheAtlantic.com.
The partnership and content was amplified via social media, custom traffic drivers, strategically distributed brand creative, and a cross-promotion with The Atlantic’s partner site, Citylab.com.
It attracted exactly the right audience—indexing especially highly with elected officials, financial professionals, and business owners.

            In an effort to build brand familiarity for Nest products through authentic storytelling, we partnered to create Connect. Home. a 3-part custom content series exploring the impact of the Internet of Things on families, couples, and communities.  
Leveraging data from the previous Nest campaign and insights in custom content consumption on The Atlantic, we created the first-ever responsive design feature.

            Native Content
              The Atlantic partnered with research firm, PSFK, to create an original study, Home Debrief, examining the major trends in the rise of IoT and the connected home.

            The Work Behind the Work
            In 1967 the Hyatt Regency in Atlanta opened its doors to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr to host the 11th Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Xernona Clayton was a pivotal character in helping plan the conference and sat down with spoken word artist, Tarriona "Tank" Bell, to have a discussion about the power of understanding one another.      
            Video
              Atlantic Re:think produced Speaking of Hope, a feature-length story about Ms. Clayton’s extraordinary life and career spent bringing people together. The piece focused on pivotal moments along Ms. Clayton’s journey and paired biographical vignettes of her life with scenes from Ms. Clayton’s conversation with Tarriona “Tank” Ball, the up-and-coming spoken word artist.

            The Work Behind the Work
            To promote the launch of a new Netflix series, Alias Grace, we published an article exploring the effects of misogyny on Victorian psychiatry. The topic was not only a strong companion to the show's themes on oppression, accountability, and trust, but also a timely fit with journalism's recent focus on feminism and women's rights. What resulted was a deeply reported, emotional story mirroring the uneasiness evoked by Alias Grace itself.      
            Native Content
              How Victorian Women Were Oppressed Through the Use of Psychiatry presented three case studies as an exploration of misogyny in 19th-century mental health care. To incorporate Netflix into the piece, we presented Grace Marks, title character of the series, as one of the case studies, while a small paragraph above the fold provided context for Netflix's sponsorship. Historical imagery and custom title calligraphy rounded out the Victorian aesthetic while pull quotes brought the article's drama front and center.

            In support of the launch of Collateral, a gripping new series from Netflix, The Atlantic was tasked with publishing a timely and engaging story that would spark buzz and build awareness about the show. To do this, we created an expertly crafted, deeply reported article that explores rampant corruption, failures, and coverups in public institutions—and how women might be key to restoring the faith.      
            Native Content
              Is There Hope For Institutions That Are Failing Us? explains why the public’s faith in civic and federal organizations is at an all-time low—and points out many instances in which women are helping rebuild and restore order. In addition to the written custom article, we did a Q&amp;A with the show's creators—entertainment industry legends David Hare and S.J. Clarkson—to get a behind-the-scenes look at how Collateral came to life. We also crafted a suite of custom illustrations inspired by classical sculpture to bring the story to life—which serve as a unique visual reference to institutions and the entrenched power they often represent.

            Atlantic Re:think and VMware partnered to create The Possibility Report, a multimedia content series exploring the unexpected implications of advancing technologies. To organize all of the content, we created a custom hub that housed native content, videos, and syndicated content from VMware.      
            Native Content
              The Possibility Report is comprised of 36 articles and infographics, organized over 6 issues: Move, Connect, Heal, Learn, Build, and Grow. Each article examines a potential technological development, like 3D printing in space, and extrapolates on how that could impact society and adjacent businesses.            
            Video
              We also produced 4 videos for the hub that touched on topics like reducing noise pollution in cities and the tech revolution in Kenya.

You could see radio host and DJ Gilles Peterson explore the resurgence of jazz in London with some of the most innovative musicians in the UK. Or you could spend some time with foundational British chef Mark Hix and discover how cooking over wood is elevating fine dining. You could also watch the founding members of Colophon Foundry discover the unexpected ways typography is affecting everything we see, from calligraphy to architecture.

            The Work Behind the Work
            The Search for Sanctuary was a deep dive into the universal search for peace of mind. It also established Nest as a brand that can help us find it. To tell this story, we brought together original reporting and video content in a first-to-market, “emotionally responsive,” interactive experience. The program encouraged readers to completely rethink how they define safety and serenity, and positioned Nest as a brand that understands the emotional importance of that search for sanctuary — and whose technology can help us find it.      
            Native Content
              The article focused on the barriers to sanctuary we experience in our day-to-day life—from crowds, to endless notifications, to home appliances—and ways to recapture the feeling of true peace of mind. With in-depth interviews and a page design that allowed users to create a picture of their own sanctuary, the piece took a snackable and customized approach towards storytelling.            
            Video
              Told through short animated stories, the videos were integrated seamlessly into the overall feature, offering a human take on our irrational fears and personal descriptions of sanctuary.

              The Search for Sanctuary feature was extended into the November print issue in a high-impact gatefold. Security typically has a negative (or boring) connotation, so our take was to rebrand security as sanctuary incorporating a diecut that highlighted the necessity of seeing the full picture.

              To bring The Ascent to life, Atlantic Re:think gathered a team of journalists, videographers, artists, professors, and data scientists to embark upon this ambitious undertaking. Throughout the article, we wove in rich user interactive elements, including a photographic timeline charting the rises to power of five different U.S. presidential couples, and body language analysis using dating from the NYU Movement Lab. And working with one of the nation’s leading linguistics experts, James Pennebaker, we used a special software to analyze the dialogues between House of Cards’ own first couple, Frank and Claire Underwood, illuminating the power dynamics between them across seasons two and three.            
            Video
              The feature also include a video interview with the foremost expert on first couples, journalist Kati Marton, who helped guide our editorial vision for the piece.

            The Work Behind the Work
            As a continuation of our "Could: Painting What's Possible" partnership with Qualcomm, we created two new experiences this year around 5G and the connected car. We understood that the technology that makes these innovations possible is hard to define and visualize, so we enlisted the help of multi-media artists and sculptors to interpret how that technology affects our society and how we interact with it.      
            Native Content
              The first feature, which launched simultaneously with our July/August print issue, focused on 5G and what this technology will enable—such as seamless virtual reality, the Internet of Things, and more—as told through video, text, infographics, tech insights, and a custom art piece. The connected car piece, which launched at the same time as our September issue, envisioned a world in which our cars can communicate automatically and digitally with everything from pedestrians, to highways, to nearby businesses.            
            Video
              We not only approached these topics from a research angle in the article, but brought in an artist to interpret and visualize the impact of this technology. In the accompanying custom video, the artist explained the meaning behind their piece and their hopes for the connected future to help humanize tech-focused topics.            
            Print
              We translated both digital features to custom print gatefolds that pulled in excerpts from the article, the artist interview, the Qualcomm perspective, and the custom art.

            The Work Behind the Work
            We created a two-part article and six-part video series highlighting the humanity in a manufacturing plant. Siemens is a leader in the wind energy movement, but the brand is not recognized as such. We spent a week in two communities, two manufacturing plants, and one wind farm to capture the people behind the process, and how wind energy has benefited rural America by creating jobs and bringing optimism to a region that's often passed over.      
            Native Content
              With on-the-ground reporting, we examined what it means to a community to have manufacturing plants return to the midwest and the impact this has on the national economy, environment, and mindset.            
            Video
              The videos captured what emotional, human words like "strength," "movement," and "touch" mean in the context of a manufacturing plant, bringing dynamism and optimism to the forefront of the feature.

            The Work Behind the Work
            Sonos was looking for a partner that could tell a story about music that was both technical and humane, and Atlantic Re:think had both the scientific and cultural expertise to do the job. Using interactive visual and audio elements, "All Ears: A Musical Homecoming” explored whether or not music has reached a saturation point and lost the intimate meaning it once held for us.      
            Native Content
              The experience, with an engaging written narrative as a backbone, was broken out into three sections: historical and cultural context, music’s psychological and physiological effects, and the evolution of music production and technology. Each section was accompanied by a customized infographic and included a specific narrative thread with the purpose of leading audiences to the realization that we make our clearest, deepest connections with music when we have an understanding of where it came from, how it came to be, and how it makes us feel.

            The Work Behind the Work
            TIAA is a financial services company that works to ensure a happy, financially stable future for its clients. In 2016, TIAA launched a rebranding campaign to show how TIAA is unique in the financial services industry, in that it understands that no two clients are the same. Working as partners, The Atlantic and TIAA uncovered data-driven and anecdotal insights about how people from all walks of life define success in their own ways.      
            Native Content
              TIAA’s custom program consisted of two phases: The first, "The Thing That Says it All," was a digital destination that included audio, visual, and text elements to show readers what objects symbolized success to different people. The second phase, "The Many Measures of Success," was kicked off with a survey of The Atlantic readers to understand how they define success and happiness. We then analyzed the results and created an interactive infographic that included data visualizations, personal anecdotes, and highlighted statistics for users to explore. Users could navigate throughout the experience and see how their perspective compared to the survey respondent sample.            
            Native Content
              We designed a custom TIAA module that lived at the end of the infographic experience. This was a great compromise for TIAA so we could balance authenticity with brand mentions.

            The Work Behind the Work
            In the winter of 2016, AtlanticLIVE partnered with United Technologies to host "Growing Cities," a one-day gathering in NYC focused around sustainable urbanization. As the exclusive event sponsor, United Technologies received sole branding across all event messaging (the company's CEO was also a featured speaker at the event). Speakers included thought leaders from the NYC Mayor’s Office and Harvard University, editors from The Atlantic and The Economist, as well as renowned chef/restaurateur Dan Barber.      
            Event
              How can cities become more sustainable and efficient? How can they use architecture, transportation, and production of everyday goods to meet demands of growing populations?
We explored questions like these and much more during the Growing Cities Forum.
To expand the impact of the discussion beyond the event itself, Re:think commissioned reported stories and videos from the event that lived on TheAtlantic.com after the event was over.            
            Native Content
              In conjunction with the AtlanticLIVE event, we published an engaging piece of syndicated content from UTC about the future of urbanization. Written by the company's Chief Sustainability Officer, it's engaging, high-quality branded content and a great example of just one of the ways we can bring events to life.

            The Work Behind the Work
            The “Working Better” program was an immersive custom content experience running in the U.S. and the UK that took the form of a digital platform offering relevant and diverse insights on how to enhance company productivity and efficiency. Knowing that the sharing of knowledge, ideas, and experience between peers is vital to evolution, the program was built upon in-depth qualitative research that addressed real-life pain points and challenges of C-Suite audiences (identified in a survey with The Atlantic’s network of business leaders). Then, prominent thought leaders such as Stew Friedman and Liz Wiseman were presented with the research and offered tangible tips and advice on how to tackle common business challenges. A customized, informational “mosaic” was then created for consumers to navigate based on their needs and interests. The Re:think team also produced five feature articles exploring the thought leaders’ ideas in-depth. Consumers were also able to order or download a PDF of the “Working Better” book that beautifully packaged all of the wisdom from the program (positioning Xerox as the leader in enhancing business success).      
            Native Content
              The articles offered an in-depth look at the issues emphasized in the survey results. While the dashboard mosaic offered utility and advice, the articles offered a look at possible factors causing the issues and case study examples.            
            Brand Study
              We conducted a control and exposed survey measuring the full brand campaign to great success. Xerox is traditionally seen as a copier company, but we saw through the campaign real changes in brand attributes as a result.
