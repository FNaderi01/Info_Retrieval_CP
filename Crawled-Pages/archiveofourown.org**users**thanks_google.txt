    Summary
      ‘I was betting with the other nurses as to whether you’d have pretty eyes,” a nurse began, messing with his painkillers. “Don’t worry, I won.” She smiled. Tommy tried to smile back, which he hadn’t done in some time, before opening his mouth to talk. All that came out was a slur of undecipherable letters and syllables, zero of which made any sense. “I’m sorry, sir. Please try not to speak. We think it might be damage to your Broco’s area, which affects your ability to speak properly. I’m sorry, sir. You hit your head when you fell unconscious.” The smile dropped off her face, and she broke eye contact with the soldier in front of her.
