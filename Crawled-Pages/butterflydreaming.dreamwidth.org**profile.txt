                 Mini Bio
                I am a creative person with more inspiration than focus. "Focus" is my current mantra.I am not the only butterflydreaming on the internet, but I was one of the first. In 2004, I was the only ChrysalisDreams. (I am the one Livejournal, not the one on Blogger.) I think it was the movie that ruined it for me.
