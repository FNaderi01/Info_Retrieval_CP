    Summary
      If there was one person Bakugo never expected to see with villains, it was Izuku. The Unforeseen Simulation Joint takes on a whole new meaning for Bakugo, as Izuku Midoriya demonstrates he's not the weak, defenseless kid he once was.

    Summary
      “Do you know the term touch starvation?” Shouta asked instead of replying directly.“No, that sounds fucking stupid.”Rubbing his face tiredly, he leaned back in his chair.“It means that someone isn’t getting enough physical affection and it’s affecting their mental, and sometimes even their physical well-being.”“Yeah, I don’t have that.”“Really?”or: Bakugou being touch-starved, Aizawa doing his best to help one of his kids
