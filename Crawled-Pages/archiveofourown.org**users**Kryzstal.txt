    Summary
      Derek, after Paige, went into the woods and never came out. He never left the shift. He would run with the pack on full moons, but he never spoke. He became a local legend, a strange monster in the woods who would carry the injured to help, the lost to be found.He never left the trees though, until one day, two teenagers got lost in his forest the same night a rogue alpha, running from justice, came through the woods. One of the boys was bitten, the other was his, his scent calling to the new alpha like they both had four bars of service.

    Summary
      "You know what the solution is," she says. "What's the solution?" "You get a mate." "Thank you for that, Laura. I'll file it away with the other idiotic ideas I've already tried."---Derek is sick of being treated like he's property and he's sick of his family pressuring him to find a mate. So the obvious solution is to fake a relationship with Stiles Stilinski, the annoying lacrosse player and alpha that Derek may or may not be pining over anyway.
