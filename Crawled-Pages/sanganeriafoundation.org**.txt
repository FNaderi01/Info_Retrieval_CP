                                        I read well and now talk to others. This is only because of the sponsorship and support from SFHE.

                                        Though I never liked studying, after coming to AWC, the manner of teaching has somehow inspired me to pay attention in class and complete my homework.

                                        Now I can read Hindi books and have also learnt many things in English. Drawing and painting interests me most – I come here daily and actively participate in all the extra-curricular activities.

                                            Earlier we used to spend Rs. 600 every month for purchasing a cylinder, but now we directly save that money. Thanks to the biogas plant, I can now save the time that was wasted in making dung cakes and collecting firewood.

                                        I am very happy to share that after carefully following all the instructions of project personnel for the use of biogas plant and its stove, my family is using pollution free and odourless gas for cooking.

                                            SFHE is rendering notable service to the society in the field of health and education since many years; particularly in backward area of Rajasthan known as Sekhawati. I thank them for their great philanthropic activities.

                                        I am grateful to Shri Sant Kumarji for never disheartening me for my proposals to help Shri Raghunath Hospital and Shree Raghunath Balika Vidyalaya (Girls’ school) which stands on a vast land donated by Sanganeria family.

                                        I am very glad to know about Sanganeria foundation efforts in bringing social and economic prosperity to underprivileged sections of our society. Sanganeria foundation social welfare projects are carefully designed and will have positive impact on quality of life of thousands of individuals and turning them into responsible citizens of our great nation. Let me congratulate you on the same and I request you to continue your efforts. Our CSR team will indeed take inspiration from your efforts!
