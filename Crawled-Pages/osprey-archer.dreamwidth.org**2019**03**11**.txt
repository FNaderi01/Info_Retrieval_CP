She-RaMar. 11th, 2019 06:15 pm
Julie was the one who suggested that we should begin watching the new She-Ra, but four episodes in I think that I’m the one who has gotten more invested. But Catra literally sleeps at the foot of Adora’s bed, what was I supposed to do if not get hopelessly invested in their “two cadets in dystopia supporting each other in a super unsupportive environment” thing? And then Adora gets out! And realizes that the Horde is actually evil! And she tries to convince Catra to defect with her, and Catra is like “You are only realizing this NOW?” and Adora’s like “You’ve known all along and you didn’t try to DO something?” and Catra is like “We’ll be in charge soon!”...Oh Catra. Like Hordak is ever going to let anyone else have any actual power. As he reminds Shadow Weaver, she gets to keep her magic only as long as it’s convenient to him. (But rather than putting her in her place, that brutal smackdown may have turned Shadow Weaver against Hordak. I hope so. Internal bad guy politics are one of my favorite things.)ALSO CREEPY FACE TOUCHING like basically every time Shadow Weaver is disappointed in Catra which is basically ALL THE TIME, so. And she’s setting Catra on a collision course to fight her erstwhile best friend Adora, and if the opening credits have not CRUELLY LIED TO ME then there’s going to be a big climactic best-friends-turned-bitter-enemies fight between Catra and Adora, a.k.a. MY FAVORITE THING EVER LET’S DO IT.Although Catra will need to level waaaaay up before she can hold her own against She-Ra. I am looking forward to whatever deeply questionable life choices she makes in pursuit of that goal.
