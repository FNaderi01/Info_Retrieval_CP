2Apparently we’re at 100 days of lockdown now. Some decaf and shared workspaces at home on this gloomy afternoon : - )

While working as a third-party consultant admittedly offers very little in the way of job security, I get more entertainment than I probably should out of playing dumb when some pencil-pushing middle manager forgets that I’m not an employee and tries to badger me into working unpaid overtime.They’ll be banging on about how they’re going to need me to come in on odd days or odd hours to put this or that deadline back on track, and I’ll be like “fantastic – I will definitely do that, just as soon as you provide written authorisation for the extension to the contracted hours”.Of course, what they mean is that they want me to work the hours and not invoice for them, but they can’t actually say that, and I’m sitting there absolutely refusing to take the hint. Just putting on my best customer service smile and super poiltely explaining the proper procedure for authorising contract overages like I think they forgot. The dawning horror as they realise they’re going to have produce a written commitment to actually pay me if they want to escape from this conversation with their dignity intact honestly warms my heart. You ever see a grown man backtrack so fast he starts stammering like Porky Pig? I have.

The thing about finding a sustainable rate of artistic output is that it isn’t just advisable, it’s ultimately inevitable.For example, if you push yourself to update your comic three times a week, manage it for three months, then blow out your wrists and end up taking half a year off to recover, in the end you produced the same number of updates over that total span as you would have if you’d just stuck to once a week to begin with.Any understanding of your output over time must take into account time spent recovering from injury and burnout. If you ask whether pushing yourself to the breaking point actually increased your overall output once that downtime has properly been factored in, the answer is almost invariably going to be “no”.It’s not a “no pain, no gain” scenario, because there’s nothing to be gained. You’re just hurting yourself for no reason.

Here is a list of some YouTube ASMR ambiences/soundscapes (they’re all hyperlinked, so click away!) Unlike traditional ASMR, these videos do not feature any people. Talented YouTubers have used software to create rendered environments with layered sounds, with many of these ambiences inspired from fantasy to others based in reality. I find music with lyrics to be distracting sometimes, but these are great background noises for focusing, studying, doing homework, and even for relaxing.

I don’t know what your learning process looks like, but when it comes to information technology, mine goes a little like this:1. Perform some routine procedure I’ve done a hundred times before, with the same hardware, under identical circumstances, to absolutely no incident, and which by rights ought to take about five minutes.2. Everything breaks forever.3. Spend the next six hours playing Sherlock Fucking Holmes trying to determine what exactly went wrong.4. Emerge with a much more comprehensive understanding of the system in question, and also a considerably higher level of contempt for whoever designed the stupid thing in the first place.

« Suppose that, at a given moment, a certain number of people are engaged 
in the manufacture of pins. They make as many pins as the world needs, 
working (say) eight hours a day. Someone makes an invention by which the
 same number of men can make twice as many pins: pins are already so 
cheap that hardly any more will be bought at a lower price. In a 
sensible world, everybody concerned in the manufacturing of pins would 
take to working four hours instead of eight, and everything else would 
go on as before. But in the actual world this would be thought 
demoralizing. The men still work eight hours, there are too many pins, 
some employers go bankrupt, and half the men previously concerned in 
making pins are thrown out of work. There is, in the end, just as much 
leisure as on the other plan, but half the men are totally idle while 
half are still overworked. In this way, it is insured that the 
unavoidable leisure shall cause misery all round instead of being a 
universal source of happiness. Can anything more insane be imagined? »— Bertrand Russell, In Praise of Idleness and Other Essays
