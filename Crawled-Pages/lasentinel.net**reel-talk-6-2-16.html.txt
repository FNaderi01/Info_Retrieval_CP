	Paula Patton heads to the big screen with sci-fi film ‘Warcraft   Paula Patton stars in sci-fi film, ‘Warcraft,’ an epic adventure of world-colliding conflict based on video game company, Blizzard Entertainment’s global phenomenon. Patton plays Garona Halforcen, a secretive half-orc and half-human warrior caught in the middle of the conflict between the invading orcs and warriors of Azeroth. The film follows, the peaceful realm of Azeroth who stands on the brink of war as its civilization faces a fearsome race of invaders: Orc warriors fleeing their dying home to colonize another.  As a portal opens to connect the two worlds, one army faces destruction and the other faces extinction.  From opposing sides, two heroes are set on a collision course that will decide the fate of their family, their people and their home. On her 6-year-old son Julian loving her character, “He really liked it. I’m ‘Orc Mommy’ or ‘Mommy Orc,” Patton told eonline.com. “He wanted the ears. Every couple of days we had to change them out, we’d tape them to his ears. He thought that was quite cool.” Starring alongside Patton is Travis Fimmel, Ben Foster, Dominic Cooper, Toby Kebbell, Ben Schnetzer, Rob Kazinsky and Daniel Wu. The film is directed by Duncan Jones and written by Charles Leavitt. ‘Warcraft’ will be released by Universal Pictures and is due out in theaters on June 10.
