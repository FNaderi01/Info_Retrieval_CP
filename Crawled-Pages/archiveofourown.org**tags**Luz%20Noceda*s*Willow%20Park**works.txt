    Summary
      Witches are pretty wild. Amity has had a lot of experience, but none of it gives her the same thrill that she gets when she engages with Luz in the heat of anger. Luz opens herself to the spicy enemies but secret lovers trope she's dreamed of. However, with an oblivious Luz and a pining Amity struggling with additional feelings, things are sure to be more complicated than simple hatefucking. And what are Boscha and Willow doing, anyway? This fanfiction will follow the series in real time, taking a few creative liberties. I've changed the title because, really, they only hate fucking for about the first five chapters. If you hate the title now, please recommend a new one, because I sometimes suck at naming things.

    Summary
      Even though she was literally in a world where magic fueled everything, even the orbs doing nothing but floating and lighting up the world, Luz still dreamed, because that’s what she was best at. And as Willow shifted against her shoulder, resting her head in the crook of Luz’s neck in the most adorable way, a thought struck Luz out of the blue, taking over her mind with hopeful images of the future. Can Willow dance?

    Summary
      Luz is a loyal friend. She would do anything to help those whom she loves, even let herself be assaulted. She would even pretend to be okay to make sure no one worries.Amity has a devastating crush. Her worst fear is for someone to reveal it. Actually, her worst fear is for something terrible to happen to her crush in front of her.Willow is the most supportive friend anyone could want. But maybe she ought to tone down the viciousness brewing in her vengeful little heart.And Boscha? Well. Boscha's just a bitch. Let's hope a redemption arc hits her over the head and knocks some sense into her.
