			Synopsis:
A story of shipwreck and magic, The Tempest begins on a ship caught in a violent storm with Alonso, the king of Naples, on board. On a nearby island, the exiled Duke of Milan, Prospero, tells his daughter, Miranda, that he has caused the storm with his magical powers. Prospero had been banished twelve years earlier when Prospero’s brother, Antonio—also on the doomed ship—conspired with Alonso to become the duke instead. Prospero and Miranda are served by a spirit named Ariel and by Caliban, son of the island’s previous inhabitant, the witch Sycorax.
On the island, castaways from the wreck begin to appear. First is Alonso’s son Ferdinand, who immediately falls in love with Miranda. Prospero secretly approves of their love, but tests the pair by enslaving Ferdinand. After secretly watching Miranda and Ferdinand exchange vows, Prospero releases Ferdinand and consents to their marriage.
Other castaways who appear are Trinculo and Stephano, Alonso’s jester and butler, who join forces with Caliban to kill Prospero and take over the island. The nobles from the ship search for Ferdinand and are confronted with a spectacle including a Harpy, who convinces Alonso that Ferdinand’s death is retribution for Prospero’s exile.
Having all his enemies under his control, Prospero decides to forgive them. Alonso, joyously reunited with his son, restores Prospero to the dukedom of Milan and welcomes Miranda as Ferdinand’s wife. As all except Caliban and Ariel prepare to leave the island, Prospero, who has given up his magic, bids farewell to the island and the audience.

ACT 1
Scene 1
A tempestuous noise of thunder and lightning heard.Enter a Shipmaster and a Boatswain.MASTER Boatswain!BOATSWAIN Here, master. What cheer?MASTER Good, speak to th’ mariners. Fall to ’t yarely, or we run ourselves aground. Bestir, bestir!He exits.Enter Mariners.BOATSWAIN 5Heigh, my hearts! Cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! Yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to th’ Master’s whistle.—Blow till thou burst thy wind, if room enough!Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Ferdinand, Gonzalo,and others.ALONSO Good boatswain, have care. Where’s the Master?10 Play the men.BOATSWAIN I pray now, keep below.ANTONIO Where is the Master, boatswain?BOATSWAIN Do you not hear him? You mar our labor. Keep your cabins. You do assist the storm.GONZALO 15Nay, good, be patient.BOATSWAIN When the sea is. Hence! What cares these7

 roarers for the name of king? To cabin! Silence! Trouble us not.GONZALO Good, yet remember whom thou hast20 aboard.BOATSWAIN None that I more love than myself. You are a councillor; if you can command these elements to silence, and work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope more. Use your authority. If25 you cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap.—Cheerly, good hearts!—Out of our way, I say!He exits.GONZALO I have great comfort from this fellow. Methinks30 he hath no drowning mark upon him. His complexion is perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging. Make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth little advantage. If he be not born to be hanged, our case is miserable.He exits ⌜with Alonso, Sebastian,and the other courtiers.⌝Enter Boatswain.BOATSWAIN 35Down with the topmast! Yare! Lower, lower! Bring her to try wi’ th’ main course. (A cry within.) A plague upon this howling! They are louder than the weather or our office.Enter Sebastian, Antonio, and Gonzalo. Yet again? What do you here? Shall we give o’er and40 drown? Have you a mind to sink?SEBASTIAN A pox o’ your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, incharitable dog!BOATSWAIN Work you, then.ANTONIO Hang, cur, hang, you whoreson, insolent45 noisemaker! We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.

GONZALO I’ll warrant him for drowning, though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench.BOATSWAIN 50Lay her ahold, ahold! Set her two courses. Off to sea again! Lay her off!Enter ⌜more⌝ Mariners, wet.MARINERS All lost! To prayers, to prayers! All lost!⌜Mariners exit.⌝BOATSWAIN What, must our mouths be cold?GONZALO The King and Prince at prayers. Let’s assist55 them, for our case is as theirs.SEBASTIAN I am out of patience.ANTONIO We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards. This wide-chopped rascal—would thou mightst lie drowning the washing of ten tides!⌜Boatswain exits.⌝GONZALO 60He’ll be hanged yet, though every drop of water swear against it and gape at wid’st to glut him.A confused noise within: “Mercy on us!”—“We split, we split!”—“Farewell, my wife and children!”— “Farewell, brother!”—“We split, we split, we65 split!”ANTONIO Let’s all sink wi’ th’ King.SEBASTIAN Let’s take leave of him.He exits ⌜with Antonio.⌝GONZALO Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground: long heath, brown70 furze, anything. The wills above be done, but I would fain die a dry death.He exits.

Scene 2
Enter Prospero and Miranda.MIRANDA  If by your art, my dearest father, you have Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them. The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch, But that the sea, mounting to th’ welkin’s cheek,5 Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered With those that I saw suffer! A brave vessel, Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her, Dashed all to pieces. O, the cry did knock Against my very heart! Poor souls, they perished.10 Had I been any god of power, I would Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere It should the good ship so have swallowed, and The fraughting souls within her.PROSPERO  Be collected.15 No more amazement. Tell your piteous heart There’s no harm done.MIRANDA  O, woe the day!PROSPERO  No harm. I have done nothing but in care of thee,20 Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who Art ignorant of what thou art, naught knowing Of whence I am, nor that I am more better Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell, And thy no greater father.MIRANDA 25 More to know Did never meddle with my thoughts.PROSPERO  ’Tis time I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand And pluck my magic garment from me.⌜Putting aside his cloak.⌝30 So, Lie there, my art.—Wipe thou thine eyes. Have comfort.

The Tempest
ACT 1. SC. 2
 The direful spectacle of the wrack, which touched The very virtue of compassion in thee,35 I have with such provision in mine art So safely ordered that there is no soul— No, not so much perdition as an hair, Betid to any creature in the vessel Which thou heard’st cry, which thou saw’st sink. Sit40 down, For thou must now know farther.⌜They sit.⌝MIRANDA  You have often Begun to tell me what I am, but stopped And left me to a bootless inquisition,45 Concluding “Stay. Not yet.”PROSPERO  The hour’s now come. The very minute bids thee ope thine ear. Obey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell?50 I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not Out three years old.MIRANDA  Certainly, sir, I can.PROSPERO  By what? By any other house or person? Of anything the image tell me that55 Hath kept with thy remembrance.MIRANDA  ’Tis far off And rather like a dream than an assurance That my remembrance warrants. Had I not Four or five women once that tended me?PROSPERO 60 Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else In the dark backward and abysm of time? If thou rememb’rest aught ere thou cam’st here, How thou cam’st here thou mayst.MIRANDA 65 But that I do not.
17
The Tempest
ACT 1. SC. 2
PROSPERO  Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since, Thy father was the Duke of Milan and A prince of power.MIRANDA  Sir, are not you my father?PROSPERO 70 Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and She said thou wast my daughter. And thy father Was Duke of Milan, and his only heir And princess no worse issued.MIRANDA  O, the heavens!75 What foul play had we that we came from thence? Or blessèd was ’t we did?PROSPERO  Both, both, my girl. By foul play, as thou sayst, were we heaved thence, But blessedly holp hither.MIRANDA 80 O, my heart bleeds To think o’ th’ teen that I have turned you to, Which is from my remembrance. Please you, farther.PROSPERO  My brother and thy uncle, called Antonio—85 I pray thee, mark me—that a brother should Be so perfidious!—he whom next thyself Of all the world I loved, and to him put The manage of my state, as at that time Through all the signories it was the first,90 And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed In dignity, and for the liberal arts Without a parallel. Those being all my study, The government I cast upon my brother And to my state grew stranger, being transported95 And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle— Dost thou attend me?MIRANDA  Sir, most heedfully.

The Tempest
ACT 1. SC. 2
PROSPERO  Being once perfected how to grant suits, How to deny them, who t’ advance, and who100 To trash for overtopping, new created The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed ’em, Or else new formed ’em, having both the key Of officer and office, set all hearts i’ th’ state To what tune pleased his ear, that now he was105 The ivy which had hid my princely trunk And sucked my verdure out on ’t. Thou attend’st not.MIRANDA  O, good sir, I do.PROSPERO  I pray thee, mark me. I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated110 To closeness and the bettering of my mind With that which, but by being so retired, O’erprized all popular rate, in my false brother Awaked an evil nature, and my trust, Like a good parent, did beget of him115 A falsehood in its contrary as great As my trust was, which had indeed no limit, A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded, Not only with what my revenue yielded But what my power might else exact, like one120 Who, having into truth by telling of it, Made such a sinner of his memory To credit his own lie, he did believe He was indeed the Duke, out o’ th’ substitution And executing th’ outward face of royalty125 With all prerogative. Hence, his ambition growing— Dost thou hear?MIRANDA  Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.PROSPERO  To have no screen between this part he played And him he played it for, he needs will be

130 Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library Was dukedom large enough. Of temporal royalties He thinks me now incapable; confederates, So dry he was for sway, wi’ th’ King of Naples To give him annual tribute, do him homage,135 Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend The dukedom, yet unbowed—alas, poor Milan!— To most ignoble stooping.MIRANDA  O, the heavens!PROSPERO  Mark his condition and th’ event. Then tell me140 If this might be a brother.MIRANDA  I should sin To think but nobly of my grandmother. Good wombs have borne bad sons.PROSPERO  Now the condition.145 This King of Naples, being an enemy To me inveterate, hearkens my brother’s suit, Which was that he, in lieu o’ th’ premises Of homage and I know not how much tribute, Should presently extirpate me and mine150 Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan, With all the honors, on my brother; whereon, A treacherous army levied, one midnight Fated to th’ purpose did Antonio open The gates of Milan, and i’ th’ dead of darkness155 The ministers for th’ purpose hurried thence Me and thy crying self.MIRANDA  Alack, for pity! I, not rememb’ring how I cried out then, Will cry it o’er again. It is a hint160 That wrings mine eyes to ’t.PROSPERO  Hear a little further, And then I’ll bring thee to the present business Which now ’s upon ’s, without the which this story Were most impertinent.

ACT 1. SC. 2
MIRANDA 165 Wherefore did they not That hour destroy us?PROSPERO  Well demanded, wench. My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not, So dear the love my people bore me, nor set170 A mark so bloody on the business, but With colors fairer painted their foul ends. In few, they hurried us aboard a bark, Bore us some leagues to sea, where they prepared A rotten carcass of a butt, not rigged,175 Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats Instinctively have quit it. There they hoist us To cry to th’ sea that roared to us, to sigh To th’ winds, whose pity, sighing back again, Did us but loving wrong.MIRANDA 180 Alack, what trouble Was I then to you!PROSPERO  O, a cherubin Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile, Infusèd with a fortitude from heaven,185 When I have decked the sea with drops full salt, Under my burden groaned, which raised in me An undergoing stomach to bear up Against what should ensue.MIRANDA How came we ashore?PROSPERO 190By providence divine. Some food we had, and some fresh water, that A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo, Out of his charity, who being then appointed Master of this design, did give us, with195 Rich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries, Which since have steaded much. So, of his gentleness, Knowing I loved my books, he furnished me From mine own library with volumes that200 I prize above my dukedom.

ACT 1. SC. 2
MIRANDA  Would I might But ever see that man.PROSPERO, ⌜standing⌝  Now I arise. Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.205 Here in this island we arrived, and here Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit Than other princes can, that have more time For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.MIRANDA  Heavens thank you for ’t. And now I pray you, sir—210 For still ’tis beating in my mind—your reason For raising this sea storm?PROSPERO  Know thus far forth: By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune, Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies215 Brought to this shore; and by my prescience I find my zenith doth depend upon A most auspicious star, whose influence If now I court not, but omit, my fortunes Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions.220 Thou art inclined to sleep. ’Tis a good dullness, And give it way. I know thou canst not choose.⌜Miranda falls asleep.Prospero puts on his cloak.⌝ Come away, servant, come. I am ready now. Approach, my Ariel. Come.Enter Ariel.ARIEL  All hail, great master! Grave sir, hail! I come225 To answer thy best pleasure. Be ’t to fly, To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride On the curled clouds, to thy strong bidding task Ariel and all his quality.PROSPERO  Hast thou, spirit,230 Performed to point the tempest that I bade thee?

ACT 1. SC. 2
ARIEL To every article. I boarded the King’s ship; now on the beak, Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin, I flamed amazement. Sometimes I’d divide235 And burn in many places. On the topmast, The yards, and bowsprit would I flame distinctly, Then meet and join. Jove’s lightning, the precursors O’ th’ dreadful thunderclaps, more momentary And sight-outrunning were not. The fire and cracks240 Of sulfurous roaring the most mighty Neptune Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble, Yea, his dread trident shake.PROSPERO  My brave spirit! Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil245 Would not infect his reason?ARIEL  Not a soul But felt a fever of the mad, and played Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,250 Then all afire with me. The King’s son, Ferdinand, With hair up-staring—then like reeds, not hair— Was the first man that leaped; cried “Hell is empty, And all the devils are here.”PROSPERO  Why, that’s my spirit!255 But was not this nigh shore?ARIEL  Close by, my master.PROSPERO  But are they, Ariel, safe?ARIEL  Not a hair perished. On their sustaining garments not a blemish,260 But fresher than before; and, as thou bad’st me, In troops I have dispersed them ’bout the isle. The King’s son have I landed by himself, Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs In an odd angle of the isle, and sitting,265 His arms in this sad knot.⌜He folds his arms.⌝

The Tempest
ACT 1. SC. 2
PROSPERO  Of the King’s ship, The mariners say how thou hast disposed, And all the rest o’ th’ fleet.ARIEL  Safely in harbor270 Is the King’s ship. In the deep nook, where once Thou called’st me up at midnight to fetch dew From the still-vexed Bermoothes, there she’s hid; The mariners all under hatches stowed, Who, with a charm joined to their suffered labor,275 I have left asleep. And for the rest o’ th’ fleet, Which I dispersed, they all have met again And are upon the Mediterranean float, Bound sadly home for Naples, Supposing that they saw the King’s ship wracked280 And his great person perish.PROSPERO  Ariel, thy charge Exactly is performed. But there’s more work. What is the time o’ th’ day?ARIEL  Past the mid season.PROSPERO 285 At least two glasses. The time ’twixt six and now Must by us both be spent most preciously.ARIEL  Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains, Let me remember thee what thou hast promised, Which is not yet performed me.PROSPERO 290 How now? Moody? What is ’t thou canst demand?ARIEL  My liberty.PROSPERO  Before the time be out? No more.ARIEL  I prithee,295 Remember I have done thee worthy service, Told thee no lies, made no mistakings, served Without or grudge or grumblings. Thou did promise To bate me a full year.

PROSPERO  Dost thou forget300 From what a torment I did free thee?ARIEL  No.PROSPERO  Thou dost, and think’st it much to tread the ooze Of the salt deep, To run upon the sharp wind of the North,305 To do me business in the veins o’ th’ Earth When it is baked with frost.ARIEL  I do not, sir.PROSPERO  Thou liest, malignant thing. Hast thou forgot The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy310 Was grown into a hoop? Hast thou forgot her?ARIEL No, sir.PROSPERO  Thou hast. Where was she born? Speak. Tell me.ARIEL  Sir, in Argier.PROSPERO  O, was she so? I must315 Once in a month recount what thou hast been, Which thou forget’st. This damned witch Sycorax, For mischiefs manifold, and sorceries terrible To enter human hearing, from Argier, Thou know’st, was banished. For one thing she did320 They would not take her life. Is not this true?ARIEL Ay, sir.PROSPERO  This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child And here was left by th’ sailors. Thou, my slave, As thou report’st thyself, was then her servant,325 And for thou wast a spirit too delicate To act her earthy and abhorred commands, Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee, By help of her more potent ministers And in her most unmitigable rage,

330 Into a cloven pine, within which rift Imprisoned thou didst painfully remain A dozen years; within which space she died And left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans As fast as mill wheels strike. Then was this island335 (Save for the son that ⌜she⌝ did litter here, A freckled whelp, hag-born) not honored with A human shape.ARIEL  Yes, Caliban, her son.PROSPERO  Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban340 Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know’st What torment I did find thee in. Thy groans Did make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts Of ever-angry bears. It was a torment To lay upon the damned, which Sycorax345 Could not again undo. It was mine art, When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape The pine and let thee out.ARIEL  I thank thee, master.PROSPERO  If thou more murmur’st, I will rend an oak350 And peg thee in his knotty entrails till Thou hast howled away twelve winters.ARIEL  Pardon, master. I will be correspondent to command And do my spriting gently.PROSPERO 355Do so, and after two days I will discharge thee.ARIEL  That’s my noble master. What shall I do? Say, what? What shall I do?PROSPERO  Go make thyself like a nymph o’ th’ sea. Be subject360 To no sight but thine and mine, invisible To every eyeball else. Go, take this shape,

 And hither come in ’t. Go, hence with diligence!⌜Ariel⌝ exits. Awake, dear heart, awake. Thou hast slept well. Awake.⌜Miranda wakes.⌝MIRANDA 365 The strangeness of your story put Heaviness in me.PROSPERO  Shake it off. Come on, We’ll visit Caliban, my slave, who never Yields us kind answer.MIRANDA, ⌜rising⌝ 370 ’Tis a villain, sir, I do not love to look on.PROSPERO  But, as ’tis, We cannot miss him. He does make our fire, Fetch in our wood, and serves in offices375 That profit us.—What ho, slave, Caliban! Thou earth, thou, speak!CALIBAN, within  There’s wood enough within.PROSPERO  Come forth, I say.

My quaint Ariel, Hark in thine ear.⌜He whispers to Ariel.⌝ARIEL  My lord, it shall be done.He exits.PROSPERO, ⌜to Caliban⌝  Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!Enter Caliban.CALIBAN 385 As wicked dew as e’er my mother brushed With raven’s feather from unwholesome fen Drop on you both. A southwest blow on you And blister you all o’er.

PROSPERO  For this, be sure, tonight thou shalt have cramps,390 Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up. Urchins Shall ⌜forth at⌝ vast of night that they may work All exercise on thee. Thou shalt be pinched As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging Than bees that made ’em.CALIBAN 395 I must eat my dinner. This island’s mine by Sycorax, my mother, Which thou tak’st from me. When thou cam’st first, Thou strok’st me and made much of me, wouldst give me400 Water with berries in ’t, and teach me how To name the bigger light and how the less, That burn by day and night. And then I loved thee, And showed thee all the qualities o’ th’ isle, The fresh springs, brine pits, barren place and405 fertile. Cursed be I that did so! All the charms Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you, For I am all the subjects that you have, Which first was mine own king; and here you sty me410 In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me The rest o’ th’ island.PROSPERO  Thou most lying slave, Whom stripes may move, not kindness, I have used thee,415 Filth as thou art, with humane care, and lodged thee In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate The honor of my child.CALIBAN  O ho, O ho! Would ’t had been done!420 Thou didst prevent me. I had peopled else This isle with Calibans.

MIRANDA  Abhorrèd slave, Which any print of goodness wilt not take, Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,425 Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour One thing or other. When thou didst not, savage, Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like A thing most brutish, I endowed thy purposes430 With words that made them known. But thy vile race, Though thou didst learn, had that in ’t which good natures Could not abide to be with. Therefore wast thou435 Deservedly confined into this rock, Who hadst deserved more than a prison.CALIBAN  You taught me language, and my profit on ’t Is I know how to curse. The red plague rid you For learning me your language!PROSPERO 440 Hagseed, hence! Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou ’rt best, To answer other business. Shrugg’st thou, malice? If thou neglect’st or dost unwillingly What I command, I’ll rack thee with old cramps,445 Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar That beasts shall tremble at thy din.CALIBAN  No, pray thee. ⌜Aside.⌝ I must obey. His art is of such power It would control my dam’s god, Setebos,450 And make a vassal of him.PROSPERO  So, slave, hence.Caliban exits.Enter Ferdinand; and Ariel, invisible,playing and singing.

Song.
ARIEL  Come unto these yellow sands,  And then take hands. Curtsied when you have, and kissed455  The wild waves whist. Foot it featly here and there,  And sweet sprites bear The burden. Hark, hark!  Burden dispersedly, ⌜within:⌝ Bow-wow.460  The watchdogs bark.  ⌜Burden dispersedly, within:⌝ Bow-wow. Hark, hark! I hear The strain of strutting chanticleer  Cry cock-a-diddle-dow.FERDINAND 465 Where should this music be? I’ th’ air, or th’ earth? It sounds no more; and sure it waits upon Some god o’ th’ island. Sitting on a bank, Weeping again the King my father’s wrack, This music crept by me upon the waters,470 Allaying both their fury and my passion With its sweet air. Thence I have followed it, Or it hath drawn me rather. But ’tis gone. No, it begins again.
Song.
ARIEL  Full fathom five thy father lies.475  Of his bones are coral made. Those are pearls that were his eyes.  Nothing of him that doth fade But doth suffer a sea change Into something rich and strange.480 Sea nymphs hourly ring his knell. Burden, ⌜within:⌝ Ding dong. Hark, now I hear them: ding dong bell.

I hear it now above me.PROSPERO, ⌜to Miranda⌝  The fringèd curtains of thine eye advance And say what thou seest yond.MIRANDA  What is ’t? A spirit? Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,490 It carries a brave form. But ’tis a spirit.PROSPERO  No, wench, it eats and sleeps and hath such senses As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest Was in the wrack; and, but he’s something stained With grief—that’s beauty’s canker—thou might’st495 call him A goodly person. He hath lost his fellows And strays about to find ’em.MIRANDA  I might call him A thing divine, for nothing natural500 I ever saw so noble.PROSPERO, ⌜aside⌝  It goes on, I see, As my soul prompts it. ⌜To Ariel.⌝ Spirit, fine spirit, I’ll free thee Within two days for this.FERDINAND, ⌜seeing Miranda⌝ 505 Most sure, the goddess On whom these airs attend!—Vouchsafe my prayer May know if you remain upon this island, And that you will some good instruction give How I may bear me here. My prime request,510 Which I do last pronounce, is—O you wonder!— If you be maid or no.MIRANDA  No wonder, sir, But certainly a maid.FERDINAND  My language! Heavens!

515 I am the best of them that speak this speech, Were I but where ’tis spoken.PROSPERO  How? The best? What wert thou if the King of Naples heard thee?FERDINAND  A single thing, as I am now, that wonders520 To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me, And that he does I weep. Myself am Naples, Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld The King my father wracked.MIRANDA  Alack, for mercy!FERDINAND 525 Yes, faith, and all his lords, the Duke of Milan And his brave son being twain.PROSPERO, ⌜aside⌝  The Duke of Milan And his more braver daughter could control thee, If now ’twere fit to do ’t. At the first sight530 They have changed eyes.—Delicate Ariel, I’ll set thee free for this. ⌜To Ferdinand.⌝ A word, good sir. I fear you have done yourself some wrong. A word.MIRANDA  Why speaks my father so ungently? This535 Is the third man that e’er I saw, the first That e’er I sighed for.

He’s a traitor. ⌜To Ferdinand.⌝ Come, I’ll manacle thy neck and feet together. Sea water shalt thou drink.

Come from thy ward, For I can here disarm thee with this stick And make thy weapon drop.MIRANDA 575 Beseech you, father—PROSPERO  Hence!

Foolish wench, To th’ most of men this is a Caliban,585 And they to him are angels.MIRANDA  My affections Are then most humble. I have no ambition To see a goodlier man.PROSPERO, ⌜to Ferdinand⌝  Come on, obey.590 Thy nerves are in their infancy again And have no vigor in them.FERDINAND  So they are. My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up. My father’s loss, the weakness which I feel,595 The wrack of all my friends, nor this man’s threats To whom I am subdued, are but light to me, Might I but through my prison once a day Behold this maid. All corners else o’ th’ Earth Let liberty make use of.

Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Gonzalo, Adrian,Francisco, and others.GONZALO, ⌜to Alonso⌝  Beseech you, sir, be merry. You have cause— So have we all—of joy, for our escape Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe Is common; every day some sailor’s wife,5 The masters of some merchant, and the merchant Have just our theme of woe. But for the miracle— I mean our preservation—few in millions Can speak like us. Then wisely, good sir, weigh Our sorrow with our comfort.ALONSO 10 Prithee, peace.SEBASTIAN, ⌜aside to Antonio⌝ He receives comfort like cold porridge.ANTONIO The visitor will not give him o’er so.SEBASTIAN Look, he’s winding up the watch of his wit.15 By and by it will strike.GONZALO, ⌜to Alonso⌝ Sir—SEBASTIAN One. Tell.GONZALO When every grief is entertained that’s offered, comes to th’ entertainer—SEBASTIAN 20A dollar.GONZALO Dolor comes to him indeed. You have spoken truer than you purposed.53

But yet—SEBASTIAN, ⌜aside to Antonio⌝ He will be talking.ANTONIO, ⌜aside to Sebastian⌝ 30Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first begins to crow?SEBASTIAN The old cock.ANTONIO The cockerel.SEBASTIAN Done. The wager?ANTONIO 35A laughter.SEBASTIAN A match!ADRIAN Though this island seem to be desert—⌜ANTONIO⌝ Ha, ha, ha.⌜SEBASTIAN⌝ So. You’re paid.ADRIAN 40Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible—SEBASTIAN Yet—ADRIAN Yet—ANTONIO He could not miss ’t.ADRIAN It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate45 temperance.ANTONIO Temperance was a delicate wench.SEBASTIAN Ay, and a subtle, as he most learnedly delivered.ADRIAN The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.SEBASTIAN 50As if it had lungs, and rotten ones.ANTONIO Or as ’twere perfumed by a fen.GONZALO Here is everything advantageous to life.ANTONIO True, save means to live.SEBASTIAN Of that there’s none, or little.GONZALO 55How lush and lusty the grass looks! How green!ANTONIO The ground indeed is tawny.SEBASTIAN With an eye of green in ’t.

ANTONIO He misses not much.SEBASTIAN 60No, he doth but mistake the truth totally.GONZALO But the rarity of it is, which is indeed almost beyond credit—SEBASTIAN As many vouched rarities are.GONZALO That our garments, being, as they were,65 drenched in the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and ⌜gloss,⌝ being rather new-dyed than stained with salt water.ANTONIO If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not say he lies?SEBASTIAN 70Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.GONZALO Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of the King’s fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.SEBASTIAN 75’Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.ADRIAN Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen.GONZALO Not since widow Dido’s time.ANTONIO 80Widow? A pox o’ that! How came that “widow” in? Widow Dido!SEBASTIAN What if he had said “widower Aeneas” too? Good Lord, how you take it!ADRIAN, ⌜to Gonzalo⌝ “Widow Dido,” said you? You85 make me study of that. She was of Carthage, not of Tunis.GONZALO This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.ADRIAN Carthage?GONZALO I assure you, Carthage.ANTONIO 90His word is more than the miraculous harp.SEBASTIAN He hath raised the wall, and houses too.ANTONIO What impossible matter will he make easy next?

SEBASTIAN I think he will carry this island home in his95 pocket and give it his son for an apple.ANTONIO And sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring forth more islands.GONZALO Ay.ANTONIO Why, in good time.GONZALO, ⌜to Alonso⌝ 100Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is now queen.ANTONIO And the rarest that e’er came there.SEBASTIAN 105Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.ANTONIO O, widow Dido? Ay, widow Dido.GONZALO, ⌜to Alonso⌝ Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it? I mean, in a sort.ANTONIO That “sort” was well fished for.GONZALO, ⌜to Alonso⌝ 110When I wore it at your daughter’s marriage.ALONSO  You cram these words into mine ears against The stomach of my sense. Would I had never Married my daughter there, for coming thence115 My son is lost, and, in my rate, she too, Who is so far from Italy removed I ne’er again shall see her.—O, thou mine heir Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish Hath made his meal on thee?FRANCISCO 120 Sir, he may live. I saw him beat the surges under him And ride upon their backs. He trod the water, Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted The surge most swoll’n that met him. His bold head125 ’Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oared Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke To th’ shore, that o’er his wave-worn basis bowed,

 As stooping to relieve him. I not doubt He came alive to land.ALONSO 130 No, no, he’s gone.SEBASTIAN  Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss, That would not bless our Europe with your daughter, But rather lose her to an African, Where she at least is banished from your eye,135 Who hath cause to wet the grief on ’t.ALONSO  Prithee, peace.SEBASTIAN  You were kneeled to and importuned otherwise By all of us; and the fair soul herself Weighed between loathness and obedience at140 Which end o’ th’ beam should bow. We have lost your son, I fear, forever. Milan and Naples have More widows in them of this business’ making Than we bring men to comfort them.145 The fault’s your own.ALONSO  So is the dear’st o’ th’ loss.GONZALO My lord Sebastian, The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness And time to speak it in. You rub the sore150 When you should bring the plaster.SEBASTIAN  Very well.ANTONIO And most chirurgeonly.GONZALO, ⌜to Alonso⌝  It is foul weather in us all, good sir, When you are cloudy.SEBASTIAN 155 Foul weather?ANTONIO  Very foul.GONZALO  Had I plantation of this isle, my lord—ANTONIO  He’d sow ’t with nettle seed.

SEBASTIAN  Or docks, or mallows.GONZALO 160 And were the king on ’t, what would I do?SEBASTIAN Scape being drunk, for want of wine.GONZALO  I’ th’ commonwealth I would by contraries Execute all things, for no kind of traffic Would I admit; no name of magistrate;165 Letters should not be known; riches, poverty, And use of service, none; contract, succession, Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none; No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil; No occupation; all men idle, all,170 And women too, but innocent and pure; No sovereignty—SEBASTIAN  Yet he would be king on ’t.ANTONIO The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning.GONZALO 175 All things in common nature should produce Without sweat or endeavor; treason, felony, Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine Would I not have; but nature should bring forth Of its own kind all foison, all abundance,180 To feed my innocent people.SEBASTIAN No marrying ’mong his subjects?ANTONIO None, man, all idle: whores and knaves.GONZALO  I would with such perfection govern, sir, T’ excel the Golden Age.SEBASTIAN 185 ’Save his Majesty!ANTONIO  Long live Gonzalo!GONZALO  And do you mark me, sir?ALONSO  Prithee, no more. Thou dost talk nothing to me.

So you may continue, and laugh at nothing still.ANTONIO What a blow was there given!SEBASTIAN An it had not fallen flatlong.GONZALO You are gentlemen of brave mettle. You200 would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue in it five weeks without changing.Enter Ariel ⌜invisible,⌝ playing solemn music.SEBASTIAN We would so, and then go a-batfowling.ANTONIO, ⌜to Gonzalo⌝ Nay, good my lord, be not angry.GONZALO No, I warrant you, I will not adventure my205 discretion so weakly. Will you laugh me asleep? For I am very heavy.ANTONIO Go sleep, and hear us.⌜All sink down asleep except Alonso,Antonio, and Sebastian.⌝ALONSO  What, all so soon asleep? I wish mine eyes Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts. I find210 They are inclined to do so.SEBASTIAN  Please you, sir, Do not omit the heavy offer of it. It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth, It is a comforter.ANTONIO 215 We two, my lord, Will guard your person while you take your rest, And watch your safety.ALONSO  Thank you.

My spirits are nimble.225 They fell together all, as by consent. They dropped as by a thunderstroke. What might, Worthy Sebastian, O, what might—? No more. And yet methinks I see it in thy face What thou shouldst be. Th’ occasion speaks thee, and230 My strong imagination sees a crown Dropping upon thy head.SEBASTIAN  What, art thou waking?ANTONIO  Do you not hear me speak?SEBASTIAN  I do, and surely235 It is a sleepy language, and thou speak’st Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say? This is a strange repose, to be asleep With eyes wide open—standing, speaking, moving— And yet so fast asleep.ANTONIO 240 Noble Sebastian, Thou let’st thy fortune sleep, die rather, wink’st Whiles thou art waking.SEBASTIAN  Thou dost snore distinctly. There’s meaning in thy snores.ANTONIO 245 I am more serious than my custom. You Must be so too, if heed me; which to do Trebles thee o’er.SEBASTIAN  Well, I am standing water.ANTONIO  I’ll teach you how to flow.

SEBASTIAN 250 Do so. To ebb Hereditary sloth instructs me.ANTONIO  O, If you but knew how you the purpose cherish Whiles thus you mock it, how in stripping it255 You more invest it. Ebbing men indeed Most often do so near the bottom run By their own fear or sloth.SEBASTIAN  Prithee, say on. The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim260 A matter from thee, and a birth indeed Which throes thee much to yield.ANTONIO  Thus, sir: Although this lord of weak remembrance—this, Who shall be of as little memory265 When he is earthed—hath here almost persuaded— For he’s a spirit of persuasion, only Professes to persuade—the King his son’s alive, ’Tis as impossible that he’s undrowned As he that sleeps here swims.SEBASTIAN 270 I have no hope That he’s undrowned.ANTONIO  O, out of that no hope What great hope have you! No hope that way is Another way so high a hope that even275 Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond, But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me That Ferdinand is drowned?SEBASTIAN  He’s gone.ANTONIO  Then tell me,280 Who’s the next heir of Naples?SEBASTIAN  Claribel.ANTONIO  She that is Queen of Tunis; she that dwells Ten leagues beyond man’s life; she that from Naples Can have no note, unless the sun were post—

285 The man i’ th’ moon’s too slow—till newborn chins Be rough and razorable; she that from whom We all were sea-swallowed, though some cast again, And by that destiny to perform an act Whereof what’s past is prologue, what to come290 In yours and my discharge.SEBASTIAN What stuff is this? How say you? ’Tis true my brother’s daughter’s Queen of Tunis, So is she heir of Naples, ’twixt which regions There is some space.ANTONIO 295 A space whose ev’ry cubit Seems to cry out “How shall that Claribel Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis And let Sebastian wake.” Say this were death That now hath seized them, why, they were no worse300 Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples As well as he that sleeps, lords that can prate As amply and unnecessarily As this Gonzalo. I myself could make A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore305 The mind that I do, what a sleep were this For your advancement! Do you understand me?SEBASTIAN  Methinks I do.ANTONIO  And how does your content Tender your own good fortune?SEBASTIAN 310 I remember You did supplant your brother Prospero.ANTONIO  True, And look how well my garments sit upon me, Much feater than before. My brother’s servants315 Were then my fellows; now they are my men.SEBASTIAN But, for your conscience?ANTONIO  Ay, sir, where lies that? If ’twere a kibe, ’Twould put me to my slipper, but I feel not

 This deity in my bosom. Twenty consciences320 That stand ’twixt me and Milan, candied be they And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother, No better than the earth he lies upon. If he were that which now he’s like—that’s dead— Whom I with this obedient steel, three inches of it,325 Can lay to bed forever; whiles you, doing thus, To the perpetual wink for aye might put This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest, They’ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk.330 They’ll tell the clock to any business that We say befits the hour.SEBASTIAN  Thy case, dear friend, Shall be my precedent: as thou got’st Milan, I’ll come by Naples. Draw thy sword. One stroke335 Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest, And I the King shall love thee.ANTONIO  Draw together, And when I rear my hand, do you the like To fall it on Gonzalo.⌜They draw their swords.⌝SEBASTIAN 340 O, but one word.⌜They talk apart.⌝Enter Ariel, ⌜invisible,⌝ with music and song.ARIEL, ⌜to the sleeping Gonzalo⌝  My master through his art foresees the danger That you, his friend, are in, and sends me forth— For else his project dies—to keep them living.Sings in Gonzalo’s ear: While you here do snoring lie,345 Open-eyed conspiracy  His time doth take. If of life you keep a care, Shake off slumber and beware.  Awake, awake!

Why are you drawn? Wherefore this ghastly looking?GONZALO, ⌜to Sebastian⌝ 355 What’s the matter?SEBASTIAN  Whiles we stood here securing your repose, Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing Like bulls, or rather lions. Did ’t not wake you? It struck mine ear most terribly.ALONSO 360 I heard nothing.ANTONIO  O, ’twas a din to fright a monster’s ear, To make an earthquake. Sure, it was the roar Of a whole herd of lions.ALONSO Heard you this, Gonzalo?GONZALO 365 Upon mine honor, sir, I heard a humming, And that a strange one too, which did awake me. I shaked you, sir, and cried. As mine eyes opened, I saw their weapons drawn. There was a noise, That’s verily. ’Tis best we stand upon our guard,370 Or that we quit this place. Let’s draw our weapons.ALONSO  Lead off this ground, and let’s make further search For my poor son.GONZALO  Heavens keep him from these beasts, For he is, sure, i’ th’ island.ALONSO 375 Lead away.ARIEL, ⌜aside⌝  Prospero my lord shall know what I have done. So, king, go safely on to seek thy son.They exit.

Enter Caliban with a burden of wood. A noise ofthunder heard.CALIBAN  All the infections that the sun sucks up From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him By inchmeal a disease! His spirits hear me, And yet I needs must curse. But they’ll nor pinch,5 Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i’ th’ mire, Nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark Out of my way, unless he bid ’em. But For every trifle are they set upon me, Sometimes like apes, that mow and chatter at me10 And after bite me; then like hedgehogs, which Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount Their pricks at my footfall. Sometime am I All wound with adders, who with cloven tongues Do hiss me into madness. Lo, now, lo!15 Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me For bringing wood in slowly. I’ll fall flat. Perchance he will not mind me.⌜He lies down and covers himself with a cloak.⌝Enter Trinculo.TRINCULO Here’s neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all. And another storm brewing; I20 hear it sing i’ th’ wind. Yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I know not where to hide my head. Yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. ⌜Noticing Caliban.⌝25 What have we here, a man or a fish? Dead or alive? A fish, he smells like a fish—a very ancient and fishlike smell, a kind of not-of-the-newest poor-John. A strange fish. Were I in England now, as once

The Tempest
ACT 2. SC. 2
 I was, and had but this fish painted, not a holiday30 fool there but would give a piece of silver. There would this monster make a man. Any strange beast there makes a man. When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legged like a man, and his fins like35 arms! Warm, o’ my troth! I do now let loose my opinion, hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an islander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt. ⌜Thunder.⌝ Alas, the storm is come again. My best way is to creep under his gaberdine. There is no40 other shelter hereabout. Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows. I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past.⌜He crawls under Caliban’s cloak.⌝Enter Stephano singing.STEPHANO  I shall no more to sea, to sea. Here shall I die ashore—45 This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man’s funeral. Well, here’s my comfort.Drinks.Sings. The master, the swabber, the boatswain, and I,  The gunner and his mate, Loved Mall, Meg, and Marian, and Margery,50  But none of us cared for Kate.  For she had a tongue with a tang,  Would cry to a sailor “Go hang!” She loved not the savor of tar nor of pitch, Yet a tailor might scratch her where’er she did itch.55  Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang! This is a scurvy tune too. But here’s my comfort.Drinks.CALIBAN Do not torment me! O!

STEPHANO What’s the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put tricks upon ’s with savages and men of Ind?60 Ha? I have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your four legs, for it hath been said “As proper a man as ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground,” and it shall be said so again while Stephano breathes at’ nostrils.CALIBAN 65The spirit torments me. O!STEPHANO This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil should he learn our language? I will give him some relief, if it be but for that. If I can recover him70 and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he’s a present for any emperor that ever trod on neat’s leather.CALIBAN Do not torment me, prithee. I’ll bring my wood home faster.STEPHANO 75He’s in his fit now, and does not talk after the wisest. He shall taste of my bottle. If he have never drunk wine afore, it will go near to remove his fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will not take too much for him. He shall pay for him that80 hath him, and that soundly.CALIBAN Thou dost me yet but little hurt. Thou wilt anon; I know it by thy trembling. Now Prosper works upon thee.STEPHANO Come on your ways. Open your mouth.85 Here is that which will give language to you, cat. Open your mouth. This will shake your shaking, I can tell you, and that soundly. ⌜Caliban drinks.⌝ You cannot tell who’s your friend. Open your chaps again.TRINCULO 90I should know that voice. It should be—but he is drowned, and these are devils. O, defend me!STEPHANO Four legs and two voices—a most delicate monster! His forward voice now is to speak well of his friend. His backward voice is to utter foul

I will pour some in thy other mouth.TRINCULO Stephano!STEPHANO 100Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy, this is a devil, and no monster! I will leave him; I have no long spoon.TRINCULO Stephano! If thou be’st Stephano, touch me and speak to me, for I am Trinculo—be not105 afeard—thy good friend Trinculo.STEPHANO If thou be’st Trinculo, come forth. I’ll pull thee by the lesser legs. If any be Trinculo’s legs, these are they. ⌜He pulls him out from under Caliban’s cloak.⌝ Thou art very Trinculo indeed. How110 cam’st thou to be the siege of this mooncalf? Can he vent Trinculos?TRINCULO I took him to be killed with a thunderstroke. But art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou art not drowned. Is the storm115 overblown? I hid me under the dead mooncalf’s gaberdine for fear of the storm. And art thou living, Stephano? O Stephano, two Neapolitans scaped!STEPHANO Prithee, do not turn me about. My stomach is not constant.CALIBAN, ⌜aside⌝ 120These be fine things, an if they be not sprites. That’s a brave god and bears celestial liquor. I will kneel to him.⌜He crawls out from under the cloak.⌝STEPHANO, ⌜to Trinculo⌝ How didst thou scape? How cam’st thou hither? Swear by this bottle how thou125 cam’st hither—I escaped upon a butt of sack, which the sailors heaved o’erboard—by this bottle, which I made of the bark of a tree with mine own hands, since I was cast ashore.

CALIBAN I’ll swear upon that bottle to be thy true130 subject, for the liquor is not earthly.STEPHANO, ⌜to Trinculo⌝ Here. Swear then how thou escapedst.TRINCULO Swum ashore, man, like a duck. I can swim like a duck, I’ll be sworn.STEPHANO 135Here, kiss the book.⌜Trinculo drinks.⌝ Though thou canst swim like a duck, thou art made like a goose.TRINCULO O Stephano, hast any more of this?STEPHANO The whole butt, man. My cellar is in a rock140 by th’ seaside, where my wine is hid.—How now, mooncalf, how does thine ague?CALIBAN Hast thou not dropped from heaven?STEPHANO Out o’ th’ moon, I do assure thee. I was the man i’ th’ moon when time was.CALIBAN 145I have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee. My mistress showed me thee, and thy dog, and thy bush.STEPHANO Come, swear to that. Kiss the book. I will furnish it anon with new contents. Swear.⌜Caliban drinks.⌝TRINCULO 150By this good light, this is a very shallow monster. I afeard of him? A very weak monster. The man i’ th’ moon? A most poor, credulous monster! —Well drawn, monster, in good sooth!CALIBAN I’ll show thee every fertile inch o’ th’ island,155 and I will kiss thy foot. I prithee, be my god.TRINCULO By this light, a most perfidious and drunken monster. When ’s god’s asleep, he’ll rob his bottle.CALIBAN I’ll kiss thy foot. I’ll swear myself thy subject.STEPHANO Come on, then. Down, and swear.⌜Caliban kneels.⌝TRINCULO 160I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed monster. A most scurvy monster.

STEPHANO Come, kiss.TRINCULO —but that the poor monster’s in drink. An165 abominable monster.CALIBAN  I’ll show thee the best springs. I’ll pluck thee berries. I’ll fish for thee and get thee wood enough. A plague upon the tyrant that I serve. I’ll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,170 Thou wondrous man.TRINCULO A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a poor drunkard.CALIBAN, ⌜standing⌝  I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow, And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts,175 Show thee a jay’s nest, and instruct thee how To snare the nimble marmoset. I’ll bring thee To clustering filberts, and sometimes I’ll get thee Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?STEPHANO I prithee now, lead the way without any180 more talking.—Trinculo, the King and all our company else being drowned, we will inherit here. —Here, bear my bottle.—Fellow Trinculo, we’ll fill him by and by again.CALIBAN sings drunkenly  Farewell, master, farewell, farewell.TRINCULO 185A howling monster, a drunken monster.CALIBAN ⌜sings⌝  No more dams I’ll make for fish,  Nor fetch in firing  At requiring, Nor scrape trenchering, nor wash dish.190  ’Ban, ’ban, Ca-caliban  Has a new master.

Scene 1
Enter Ferdinand bearing a log.FERDINAND  There be some sports are painful, and their labor Delight in them ⌜sets⌝ off; some kinds of baseness Are nobly undergone; and most poor matters Point to rich ends. This my mean task5 Would be as heavy to me as odious, but The mistress which I serve quickens what’s dead And makes my labors pleasures. O, she is Ten times more gentle than her father’s crabbed, And he’s composed of harshness. I must remove10 Some thousands of these logs and pile them up, Upon a sore injunction. My sweet mistress Weeps when she sees me work, and says such baseness Had never like executor. I forget;15 But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labors, Most ⌜busiest⌝ when I do it.Enter Miranda; and Prospero ⌜at a distance, unobserved.⌝MIRANDA  Alas now, pray you, Work not so hard. I would the lightning had Burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile.20 Pray, set it down and rest you. When this burns91

Pray now, rest yourself. He’s safe for these three hours.FERDINAND  O most dear mistress,25 The sun will set before I shall discharge What I must strive to do.MIRANDA  If you’ll sit down, I’ll bear your logs the while. Pray, give me that. I’ll carry it to the pile.FERDINAND 30 No, precious creature, I had rather crack my sinews, break my back, Than you should such dishonor undergo While I sit lazy by.MIRANDA  It would become me35 As well as it does you, and I should do it With much more ease, for my good will is to it, And yours it is against.PROSPERO, ⌜aside⌝ Poor worm, thou art infected. This visitation shows it.MIRANDA 40 You look wearily.FERDINAND  No, noble mistress, ’tis fresh morning with me When you are by at night. I do beseech you, Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers, What is your name?MIRANDA 45 Miranda.—O my father, I have broke your hest to say so!FERDINAND  Admired Miranda! Indeed the top of admiration, worth What’s dearest to the world! Full many a lady50 I have eyed with best regard, and many a time Th’ harmony of their tongues hath into bondage Brought my too diligent ear. For several virtues Have I liked several women, never any With so full soul but some defect in her55 Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed,

 And put it to the foil. But you, O you, So perfect and so peerless, are created Of every creature’s best.MIRANDA  I do not know60 One of my sex, no woman’s face remember, Save, from my glass, mine own. Nor have I seen More that I may call men than you, good friend, And my dear father. How features are abroad I am skilless of, but by my modesty,65 The jewel in my dower, I would not wish Any companion in the world but you, Nor can imagination form a shape Besides yourself to like of. But I prattle Something too wildly, and my father’s precepts70 I therein do forget.FERDINAND I am in my condition A prince, Miranda; I do think a king— I would, not so!—and would no more endure This wooden slavery than to suffer75 The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak: The very instant that I saw you did My heart fly to your service, there resides To make me slave to it, and for your sake Am I this patient log-man.MIRANDA 80 Do you love me?FERDINAND  O heaven, O Earth, bear witness to this sound, And crown what I profess with kind event If I speak true; if hollowly, invert What best is boded me to mischief. I,85 Beyond all limit of what else i’ th’ world, Do love, prize, honor you.MIRANDA  I am a fool To weep at what I am glad of.PROSPERO, ⌜aside⌝  Fair encounter

Heavens rain grace On that which breeds between ’em!FERDINAND  Wherefore weep you?MIRANDA  At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer95 What I desire to give, and much less take What I shall die to want. But this is trifling, And all the more it seeks to hide itself, The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning, And prompt me, plain and holy innocence.100 I am your wife if you will marry me. If not, I’ll die your maid. To be your fellow You may deny me, but I’ll be your servant Whether you will or no.FERDINAND  My mistress, dearest, and I thus humble ever.MIRANDA 105 My husband, then?FERDINAND  Ay, with a heart as willing As bondage e’er of freedom. Here’s my hand.MIRANDA, ⌜clasping his hand⌝  And mine, with my heart in ’t. And now farewell Till half an hour hence.FERDINAND 110 A thousand thousand.They exit.PROSPERO  So glad of this as they I cannot be, Who are surprised withal; but my rejoicing At nothing can be more.

Enter Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo.STEPHANO, ⌜to Trinculo⌝ Tell not me. When the butt is out, we will drink water; not a drop before. Therefore bear up and board ’em.—Servant monster, drink to me.TRINCULO 5Servant monster? The folly of this island! They say there’s but five upon this isle; we are three of them. If th’ other two be brained like us, the state totters.STEPHANO Drink, servant monster, when I bid thee.10 Thy eyes are almost set in thy head.⌜Caliban drinks.⌝TRINCULO Where should they be set else? He were a brave monster indeed if they were set in his tail.STEPHANO My man-monster hath drowned his tongue in sack. For my part, the sea cannot drown me. I15 swam, ere I could recover the shore, five-and-thirty leagues off and on, by this light.—Thou shalt be my lieutenant, monster, or my standard.TRINCULO Your lieutenant, if you list. He’s no standard.STEPHANO 20We’ll not run, Monsieur Monster.TRINCULO Nor go neither. But you’ll lie like dogs, and yet say nothing neither.STEPHANO Mooncalf, speak once in thy life, if thou be’st a good mooncalf.CALIBAN 25How does thy Honor? Let me lick thy shoe. I’ll not serve him; he is not valiant.TRINCULO Thou liest, most ignorant monster. I am in case to justle a constable. Why, thou debauched fish, thou! Was there ever man a coward that hath30 drunk so much sack as I today? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but half a fish and half a monster?

CALIBAN Lo, how he mocks me! Wilt thou let him, my lord?TRINCULO 35“Lord,” quoth he? That a monster should be such a natural!CALIBAN Lo, lo again! Bite him to death, I prithee.STEPHANO Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head. If you prove a mutineer, the next tree. The poor40 monster’s my subject, and he shall not suffer indignity.CALIBAN I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased to harken once again to the suit I made to thee?STEPHANO Marry, will I. Kneel and repeat it. I will45 stand, and so shall Trinculo.Enter Ariel, invisible.CALIBAN, ⌜kneeling⌝ As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.ARIEL, ⌜in Trinculo’s voice⌝ Thou liest.CALIBAN, ⌜to Trinculo⌝ 50Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou. ⌜He stands.⌝ I would my valiant master would destroy thee. I do not lie.STEPHANO Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in ’s tale, by this hand, I will supplant some of your55 teeth.TRINCULO Why, I said nothing.STEPHANO Mum then, and no more. ⌜Trinculo stands aside.⌝ Proceed.CALIBAN  I say by sorcery he got this isle;60 From me he got it. If thy Greatness will, Revenge it on him, for I know thou dar’st, But this thing dare not.STEPHANO That’s most certain.CALIBAN  Thou shalt be lord of it, and I’ll serve thee.

STEPHANO 65How now shall this be compassed? Canst thou bring me to the party?CALIBAN  Yea, yea, my lord. I’ll yield him thee asleep, Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head.ARIEL, ⌜in Trinculo’s voice⌝ Thou liest. Thou canst not.CALIBAN 70 What a pied ninny’s this!—Thou scurvy patch!— I do beseech thy Greatness, give him blows And take his bottle from him. When that’s gone, He shall drink naught but brine, for I’ll not show him Where the quick freshes are.STEPHANO 75Trinculo, run into no further danger. Interrupt the monster one word further, and by this hand, I’ll turn my mercy out o’ doors and make a stockfish of thee.TRINCULO Why, what did I? I did nothing. I’ll go80 farther off.STEPHANO Didst thou not say he lied?ARIEL, ⌜in Trinculo’s voice⌝ Thou liest.STEPHANO Do I so? Take thou that.⌜He beats Trinculo.⌝ As you like this, give me the lie another time.TRINCULO 85I did not give the lie! Out o’ your wits and hearing too? A pox o’ your bottle! This can sack and drinking do. A murrain on your monster, and the devil take your fingers!CALIBAN Ha, ha, ha!STEPHANO 90Now forward with your tale. ⌜To Trinculo.⌝ Prithee, stand further off.CALIBAN  Beat him enough.

 I’ th’ afternoon to sleep. There thou mayst brain him, Having first seized his books, or with a log Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,100 Or cut his weasand with thy knife. Remember First to possess his books, for without them He’s but a sot, as I am, nor hath not One spirit to command. They all do hate him As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.105 He has brave utensils—for so he calls them— Which, when he has a house, he’ll deck withal. And that most deeply to consider is The beauty of his daughter. He himself Calls her a nonpareil. I never saw a woman110 But only Sycorax my dam and she; But she as far surpasseth Sycorax As great’st does least.STEPHANO  Is it so brave a lass?CALIBAN  Ay, lord, she will become thy bed, I warrant,115 And bring thee forth brave brood.STEPHANO Monster, I will kill this man. His daughter and I will be king and queen—save our Graces!— and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys.—Dost thou like the plot, Trinculo?TRINCULO 120Excellent.STEPHANO Give me thy hand. I am sorry I beat thee. But while thou liv’st, keep a good tongue in thy head.CALIBAN  Within this half hour will he be asleep.125 Wilt thou destroy him then?STEPHANO  Ay, on mine honor.ARIEL, ⌜aside⌝ This will I tell my master.CALIBAN  Thou mak’st me merry.

If thou be’st a devil, take ’t as thou list.TRINCULO O, forgive me my sins!STEPHANO He that dies pays all debts.—I defy thee!—145 Mercy upon us!CALIBAN Art thou afeard?STEPHANO No, monster, not I.CALIBAN  Be not afeard. The isle is full of noises, Sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not.150 Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments Will hum about mine ears, and sometimes voices That, if I then had waked after long sleep, Will make me sleep again; and then, in dreaming, The clouds methought would open, and show riches155 Ready to drop upon me, that when I waked I cried to dream again.STEPHANO This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall have my music for nothing.CALIBAN When Prospero is destroyed.STEPHANO 160That shall be by and by. I remember the story.

By your patience,5 I needs must rest me.ALONSO  Old lord, I cannot blame thee. Who am myself attached with weariness To th’ dulling of my spirits. Sit down and rest. Even here I will put off my hope and keep it10 No longer for my flatterer. He is drowned Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.ANTONIO, ⌜aside to Sebastian⌝  I am right glad that he’s so out of hope. Do not, for one repulse, forgo the purpose15 That you resolved t’ effect.SEBASTIAN, ⌜aside to Antonio⌝  The next advantage Will we take throughly.ANTONIO, ⌜aside to Sebastian⌝  Let it be tonight; For now they are oppressed with travel, they20 Will not nor cannot use such vigilance As when they are fresh.SEBASTIAN, ⌜aside to Antonio⌝  I say tonight.

What were these?SEBASTIAN  A living drollery! Now I will believe That there are unicorns, that in Arabia There is one tree, the phoenix’ throne, one phoenix At this hour reigning there.ANTONIO 30 I’ll believe both; And what does else want credit, come to me And I’ll be sworn ’tis true. Travelers ne’er did lie, Though fools at home condemn ’em.GONZALO  If in Naples35 I should report this now, would they believe me? If I should say I saw such ⌜islanders⌝— For, certes, these are people of the island— Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet note Their manners are more gentle, kind, than of40 Our human generation you shall find Many, nay, almost any.PROSPERO, ⌜aside⌝  Honest lord, Thou hast said well, for some of you there present Are worse than devils.ALONSO 45 I cannot too much muse Such shapes, such gesture, and such sound, expressing— Although they want the use of tongue—a kind Of excellent dumb discourse.

When we were boys, Who would believe that there were mountaineers Dewlapped like bulls, whose throats had hanging at60 ’em Wallets of flesh? Or that there were such men Whose heads stood in their breasts? Which now we find Each putter-out of five for one will bring us65 Good warrant of.ALONSO  I will stand to and feed. Although my last, no matter, since I feel The best is past.

 Their proper selves.⌜Alonso, Sebastian, and Antonio draw their swords.⌝ You fools, I and my fellows Are ministers of Fate. The elements80 Of whom your swords are tempered may as well Wound the loud winds or with bemocked-at stabs Kill the still-closing waters as diminish One dowl that’s in my plume. My fellow ministers Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,85 Your swords are now too massy for your strengths And will not be uplifted. But remember— For that’s my business to you—that you three From Milan did supplant good Prospero, Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,90 Him and his innocent child, for which foul deed, The powers—delaying, not forgetting—have Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso, They have bereft; and do pronounce by me95 Ling’ring perdition, worse than any death Can be at once, shall step by step attend You and your ways, whose wraths to guard you from— Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls100 Upon your heads—is nothing but heart’s sorrow And a clear life ensuing.He vanishes in thunder.Then, to soft music, enter the shapes again, and dance,with mocks and mows, and carrying out the table.PROSPERO, ⌜aside⌝  Bravely the figure of this Harpy hast thou Performed, my Ariel.

It did bass my trespass. Therefor my son i’ th’ ooze is bedded, and I’ll seek him deeper than e’er plummet sounded, And with him there lie mudded.He exits.SEBASTIAN But one fiend at a time,125 I’ll fight their legions o’er.ANTONIO  I’ll be thy second.They exit.GONZALO  All three of them are desperate. Their great guilt, Like poison given to work a great time after, Now ’gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you130 That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly And hinder them from what this ecstasy May now provoke them to.ADRIAN  Follow, I pray you.They all exit.
ACT 4
Scene 1
Enter Prospero, Ferdinand, and Miranda.PROSPERO, ⌜to Ferdinand⌝  If I have too austerely punished you, Your compensation makes amends, for I Have given you here a third of mine own life, Or that for which I live; who once again5 I tender to thy hand. All thy vexations Were but my trials of thy love, and thou Hast strangely stood the test. Here afore heaven I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand, Do not smile at me that I boast ⌜of her,⌝10 For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise And make it halt behind her.FERDINAND  I do believe it Against an oracle.PROSPERO  Then, as my ⌜gift⌝ and thine own acquisition15 Worthily purchased, take my daughter. But If thou dost break her virgin-knot before All sanctimonious ceremonies may With full and holy rite be ministered, No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall20 To make this contract grow; but barren hate, Sour-eyed disdain, and discord shall bestrew121

 The union of your bed with weeds so loathly That you shall hate it both. Therefore take heed, As Hymen’s lamps shall light you.FERDINAND 25 As I hope For quiet days, fair issue, and long life, With such love as ’tis now, the murkiest den, The most opportune place, the strong’st suggestion Our worser genius can shall never melt30 Mine honor into lust to take away The edge of that day’s celebration When I shall think or Phoebus’ steeds are foundered Or night kept chained below.PROSPERO  Fairly spoke.35 Sit then and talk with her. She is thine own.⌜Ferdinand and Miranda move aside.⌝ What, Ariel, my industrious servant, Ariel!Enter Ariel.ARIEL  What would my potent master? Here I am.PROSPERO  Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service Did worthily perform, and I must use you40 In such another trick. Go bring the rabble, O’er whom I give thee power, here to this place. Incite them to quick motion, for I must Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple Some vanity of mine art. It is my promise,45 And they expect it from me.ARIEL  Presently?PROSPERO Ay, with a twink.ARIEL  Before you can say “Come” and “Go,” And breathe twice, and cry “So, so,”50 Each one, tripping on his toe, Will be here with mop and mow. Do you love me, master? No?

PROSPERO  Dearly, my delicate Ariel. Do not approach Till thou dost hear me call.ARIEL 55 Well; I conceive.He exits.PROSPERO, ⌜to Ferdinand⌝  Look thou be true; do not give dalliance Too much the rein. The strongest oaths are straw To th’ fire i’ th’ blood. Be more abstemious, Or else goodnight your vow.FERDINAND 60 I warrant you, sir, The white cold virgin snow upon my heart Abates the ardor of my liver.PROSPERO  Well.— Now come, my Ariel. Bring a corollary65 Rather than want a spirit. Appear, and pertly.Soft music. No tongue. All eyes. Be silent.Enter Iris.IRIS  Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats, and peas; Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,70 And flat meads thatched with stover, them to keep; Thy banks with pionèd and twillèd brims, Which spongy April at thy hest betrims To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom groves,75 Whose shadow the dismissèd bachelor loves, Being lass-lorn; thy poll-clipped vineyard, And thy sea marge, sterile and rocky hard, Where thou thyself dost air—the Queen o’ th’ sky, Whose wat’ry arch and messenger am I,80 Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace, Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,

 To come and sport. ⌜Her⌝ peacocks fly amain. Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.Enter Ceres.CERES  Hail, many-colored messenger, that ne’er85 Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter; Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers Diffusest honey drops, refreshing showers; And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown My bosky acres and my unshrubbed down,90 Rich scarf to my proud Earth. Why hath thy queen Summoned me hither to this short-grassed green?IRIS  A contract of true love to celebrate, And some donation freely to estate On the blest lovers.CERES 95 Tell me, heavenly bow, If Venus or her son, as thou dost know, Do now attend the Queen? Since they did plot The means that dusky Dis my daughter got, Her and her blind boy’s scandaled company100 I have forsworn.IRIS  Of her society Be not afraid. I met her deity Cutting the clouds towards Paphos, and her son Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have105 done Some wanton charm upon this man and maid, Whose vows are that no bed-right shall be paid Till Hymen’s torch be lighted—but in vain. Mars’s hot minion is returned again;110 Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows, Swears he will shoot no more, but play with sparrows, And be a boy right out.

Juno descends.CERES  Highest queen of state,115 Great Juno, comes. I know her by her gait.JUNO  How does my bounteous sister? Go with me To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be And honored in their issue.They sing.JUNO  Honor, riches, marriage-blessing,120 Long continuance and increasing, Hourly joys be still upon you. Juno sings her blessings on you.⌜CERES⌝  Earth’s increase, foison plenty, Barns and garners never empty,125 Vines with clust’ring bunches growing, Plants with goodly burden bowing; Spring come to you at the farthest In the very end of harvest. Scarcity and want shall shun you.130 Ceres’ blessing so is on you.FERDINAND  This is a most majestic vision, and Harmonious charmingly. May I be bold To think these spirits?PROSPERO  Spirits, which by mine art135 I have from their confines called to enact My present fancies.FERDINAND  Let me live here ever. So rare a wondered father and a wise Makes this place paradise.Juno and Ceres whisper,and send Iris on employment.PROSPERO 140 Sweet now, silence.

 Juno and Ceres whisper seriously. There’s something else to do. Hush, and be mute, Or else our spell is marred.IRIS  You nymphs, called naiads of the windring brooks,145 With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks, Leave your crisp channels and on this green land Answer your summons, Juno does command. Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate A contract of true love. Be not too late.Enter certain Nymphs.150 You sunburned sicklemen, of August weary, Come hither from the furrow and be merry. Make holiday: your rye-straw hats put on, And these fresh nymphs encounter every one In country footing.Enter certain Reapers, properly habited. They join withthe Nymphs in a graceful dance, towards the endwhereof Prospero starts suddenly and speaks.PROSPERO 155 I had forgot that foul conspiracy Of the beast Caliban and his confederates Against my life. The minute of their plot Is almost come.—Well done. Avoid. No more.To a strange, hollow, and confused noise,⌜the spirits⌝ heavily vanish.FERDINAND, ⌜to Miranda⌝  This is strange. Your father’s in some passion160 That works him strongly.MIRANDA  Never till this day Saw I him touched with anger, so distempered.PROSPERO, ⌜to Ferdinand⌝  You do look, my son, in a moved sort, As if you were dismayed. Be cheerful, sir.

165 Our revels now are ended. These our actors, As I foretold you, were all spirits and Are melted into air, into thin air; And like the baseless fabric of this vision, The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,170 The solemn temples, the great globe itself, Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve, And, like this insubstantial pageant faded, Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff As dreams are made on, and our little life175 Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vexed. Bear with my weakness. My old brain is troubled. Be not disturbed with my infirmity. If you be pleased, retire into my cell And there repose. A turn or two I’ll walk180 To still my beating mind.FERDINAND/MIRANDA  We wish your peace.⌜They⌝ exit.Enter Ariel.PROSPERO  Come with a thought. I thank thee, Ariel. Come.ARIEL  Thy thoughts I cleave to. What’s thy pleasure?PROSPERO  Spirit,185 We must prepare to meet with Caliban.ARIEL  Ay, my commander. When I presented Ceres, I thought to have told thee of it, but I feared Lest I might anger thee.PROSPERO  Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?ARIEL 190 I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking, So full of valor that they smote the air For breathing in their faces, beat the ground

 For kissing of their feet; yet always bending Towards their project. Then I beat my tabor,195 At which, like unbacked colts, they pricked their ears, Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses As they smelt music. So I charmed their ears That, calf-like, they my lowing followed through200 Toothed briers, sharp furzes, pricking gorse, and thorns, Which entered their frail shins. At last I left them I’ th’ filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell, There dancing up to th’ chins, that the foul lake205 O’erstunk their feet.PROSPERO  This was well done, my bird. Thy shape invisible retain thou still. The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither For stale to catch these thieves.ARIEL 210 I go, I go.He exits.PROSPERO  A devil, a born devil, on whose nature Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains, Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost; And as with age his body uglier grows,215 So his mind cankers. I will plague them all Even to roaring.Enter Ariel, loaden with glistering apparel, etc. Come, hang ⌜them on⌝ this line.Enter Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo, all wet, ⌜asProspero and Ariel look on.⌝CALIBAN Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not hear a footfall.

If I should take a displeasure against you, look you—TRINCULO Thou wert but a lost monster.CALIBAN  Good my lord, give me thy favor still. Be patient, for the prize I’ll bring thee to230 Shall hoodwink this mischance. Therefore speak softly. All’s hushed as midnight yet.TRINCULO Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool!STEPHANO There is not only disgrace and dishonor in235 that, monster, but an infinite loss.TRINCULO That’s more to me than my wetting. Yet this is your harmless fairy, monster!STEPHANO I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o’er ears for my labor.CALIBAN 240 Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here, This is the mouth o’ th’ cell. No noise, and enter. Do that good mischief which may make this island Thine own forever, and I, thy Caliban, For aye thy foot-licker.STEPHANO 245Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.TRINCULO, ⌜seeing the apparel⌝ O King Stephano, O peer, O worthy Stephano, look what a wardrobe here is for thee!CALIBAN 250 Let it alone, thou fool. It is but trash.TRINCULO Oho, monster, we know what belongs to a frippery. ⌜He puts on one of the gowns.⌝ O King Stephano!STEPHANO Put off that gown, Trinculo. By this hand,255 I’ll have that gown.

If he awake,260 From toe to crown he’ll fill our skins with pinches, Make us strange stuff.STEPHANO Be you quiet, monster.—Mistress Line, is not this my jerkin?⌜He takes a jacket from the tree.⌝ Now is the jerkin under the line.—Now, jerkin, you265 are like to lose your hair and prove a bald jerkin.TRINCULO Do, do. We steal by line and level, an ’t like your Grace.STEPHANO I thank thee for that jest. Here’s a garment for ’t. Wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king270 of this country. “Steal by line and level” is an excellent pass of pate. There’s another garment for ’t.TRINCULO Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and away with the rest.CALIBAN  I will have none on ’t. We shall lose our time275 And all be turned to barnacles or to apes With foreheads villainous low.STEPHANO Monster, lay to your fingers. Help to bear this away where my hogshead of wine is, or I’ll turn you out of my kingdom. Go to, carry this.TRINCULO 280And this.STEPHANO Ay, and this.A noise of hunters heard.Enter divers spirits in shape of dogs and hounds,hunting them about, Prospero and Ariel setting them on.PROSPERO Hey, Mountain, hey!ARIEL Silver! There it goes, Silver!PROSPERO  Fury, Fury! There, Tyrant, there! Hark, hark!⌜Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo are driven off.⌝

At this hour Lies at my mercy all mine enemies. Shortly shall all my labors end, and thou Shalt have the air at freedom. For a little295 Follow and do me service.They exit.

Enter Prospero in his magic robes, and Ariel.PROSPERO  Now does my project gather to a head. My charms crack not, my spirits obey, and time Goes upright with his carriage.—How’s the day?ARIEL  On the sixth hour, at which time, my lord,5 You said our work should cease.PROSPERO  I did say so When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit, How fares the King and ’s followers?ARIEL  Confined10 together In the same fashion as you gave in charge, Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir, In the line grove which weather-fends your cell. They cannot budge till your release. The King,15 His brother, and yours abide all three distracted, And the remainder mourning over them, Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly Him that you termed, sir, the good old Lord Gonzalo.20 His tears runs down his beard like winter’s drops From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works ’em145

ACT 5. SC. 1
 That if you now beheld them, your affections Would become tender.PROSPERO 25 Dost thou think so, spirit?ARIEL  Mine would, sir, were I human.PROSPERO  And mine shall. Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,30 One of their kind, that relish all as sharply Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art? Though with their high wrongs I am struck to th’ quick, Yet with my nobler reason ’gainst my fury35 Do I take part. The rarer action is In virtue than in vengeance. They being penitent, The sole drift of my purpose doth extend Not a frown further. Go, release them, Ariel. My charms I’ll break, their senses I’ll restore,40 And they shall be themselves.ARIEL  I’ll fetch them, sir.He exits.⌜Prospero draws a large circle on the stage with his staff.⌝PROSPERO  You elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves, And you that on the sands with printless foot Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him45 When he comes back; you demi-puppets that By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make, Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime Is to make midnight mushrumps, that rejoice To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,50 Weak masters though you be, I have bedimmed The noontide sun, called forth the mutinous winds, And ’twixt the green sea and the azured vault

ACT 5. SC. 1
 Set roaring war; to the dread rattling thunder Have I given fire, and rifted Jove’s stout oak55 With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory Have I made shake, and by the spurs plucked up The pine and cedar; graves at my command Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let ’em forth By my so potent art. But this rough magic60 I here abjure, and when I have required Some heavenly music, which even now I do,⌜Prospero gestures with his staff.⌝ To work mine end upon their senses that This airy charm is for, I’ll break my staff, Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,65 And deeper than did ever plummet sound I’ll drown my book.Solemn music.Here enters Ariel before; then Alonso with a franticgesture, attended by Gonzalo; Sebastian and Antonio inlike manner attended by Adrian and Francisco. They allenter the circle which Prospero had made, and therestand charmed; which Prospero observing, speaks. A solemn air, and the best comforter To an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains, Now useless, ⌜boiled⌝ within thy skull. There stand,70 For you are spell-stopped.— Holy Gonzalo, honorable man, Mine eyes, e’en sociable to the show of thine, Fall fellowly drops.—The charm dissolves apace, And as the morning steals upon the night,75 Melting the darkness, so their rising senses Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle Their clearer reason.—O good Gonzalo, My true preserver and a loyal sir To him thou follow’st, I will pay thy graces80 Home, both in word and deed.—Most cruelly

ACT 5. SC. 1
 Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter. Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.— Thou art pinched for ’t now, Sebastian.—Flesh and blood,85 You, brother mine, that ⌜entertained⌝ ambition, Expelled remorse and nature, whom, with Sebastian, Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong, Would here have killed your king, I do forgive thee, Unnatural though thou art.—Their understanding90 Begins to swell, and the approaching tide Will shortly fill the reasonable shore That now ⌜lies⌝ foul and muddy. Not one of them That yet looks on me or would know me.—Ariel, Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell.⌜Ariel exits and at once returnswith Prospero’s ducal robes.⌝95 I will discase me and myself present As I was sometime Milan.—Quickly, spirit, Thou shalt ere long be free.ARIEL sings, and helps to attire him.   Where the bee sucks, there suck I.  In a cowslip’s bell I lie.100  There I couch when owls do cry.  On the bat’s back I do fly  After summer merrily. Merrily, merrily shall I live now Under the blossom that hangs on the bow.PROSPERO 105 Why, that’s my dainty Ariel. I shall miss Thee, but yet thou shalt have freedom. So, so, so. To the King’s ship, invisible as thou art. There shalt thou find the mariners asleep Under the hatches. The master and the boatswain110 Being awake, enforce them to this place, And presently, I prithee.

Some heavenly power guide us Out of this fearful country!PROSPERO, ⌜to Alonso⌝  Behold, sir king, The wrongèd Duke of Milan, Prospero. For more assurance that a living prince120 Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body,⌜He embraces Alonso.⌝ And to thee and thy company I bid A hearty welcome.ALONSO  Whe’er thou be’st he or no, Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me125 (As late I have been) I not know. Thy pulse Beats as of flesh and blood; and since I saw thee, Th’ affliction of my mind amends, with which I fear a madness held me. This must crave, An if this be at all, a most strange story.130 Thy dukedom I resign, and do entreat Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero Be living and be here?PROSPERO, ⌜to Gonzalo⌝  First, noble friend,135 Let me embrace thine age, whose honor cannot Be measured or confined.GONZALO  Whether this be Or be not, I’ll not swear.PROSPERO  You do yet taste140 Some subtleties o’ th’ isle, that will ⌜not⌝ let you Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all. ⌜Aside to Sebastian and Antonio.⌝ But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,

 I here could pluck his Highness’ frown upon you145 And justify you traitors. At this time I will tell no tales.SEBASTIAN, ⌜aside⌝  The devil speaks in him.PROSPERO, ⌜aside to Sebastian⌝ No. ⌜To Antonio.⌝ For you, most wicked sir, whom to150 call brother Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive Thy rankest fault, all of them, and require My dukedom of thee, which perforce I know Thou must restore.ALONSO 155 If thou be’st Prospero, Give us particulars of thy preservation, How thou hast met us here, whom three hours since Were wracked upon this shore, where I have lost— How sharp the point of this remembrance is!—160 My dear son Ferdinand.PROSPERO  I am woe for ’t, sir.ALONSO  Irreparable is the loss, and patience Says it is past her cure.PROSPERO  I rather think165 You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace, For the like loss, I have her sovereign aid And rest myself content.ALONSO  You the like loss?PROSPERO  As great to me as late, and supportable170 To make the dear loss have I means much weaker Than you may call to comfort you, for I Have lost my daughter.ALONSO A daughter? O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,175 The King and Queen there! That they were, I wish Myself were mudded in that oozy bed

 Where my son lies!—When did you lose your daughter?PROSPERO  In this last tempest. I perceive these lords180 At this encounter do so much admire That they devour their reason, and scarce think Their eyes do offices of truth, their words Are natural breath.—But howsoe’er you have Been justled from your senses, know for certain185 That I am Prospero and that very duke Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely Upon this shore, where you were wracked, was landed190 To be the lord on ’t. No more yet of this. For ’tis a chronicle of day by day, Not a relation for a breakfast, nor Befitting this first meeting. ⌜To Alonso.⌝ Welcome, sir. This cell’s my court. Here have I few attendants,195 And subjects none abroad. Pray you, look in. My dukedom since you have given me again, I will requite you with as good a thing, At least bring forth a wonder to content you As much as me my dukedom.Here Prospero discovers Ferdinand and Miranda,playing at chess.MIRANDA, ⌜to Ferdinand⌝ 200 Sweet lord, you play me false.FERDINAND  No, my dearest love, I would not for the world.MIRANDA  Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle, And I would call it fair play.ALONSO 205 If this prove A vision of the island, one dear son Shall I twice lose.

O, brave new world That has such people in ’t!PROSPERO  ’Tis new to thee.ALONSO, ⌜to Ferdinand⌝ 220 What is this maid with whom thou wast at play? Your eld’st acquaintance cannot be three hours. Is she the goddess that hath severed us And brought us thus together?FERDINAND  Sir, she is mortal,225 But by immortal providence she’s mine. I chose her when I could not ask my father For his advice, nor thought I had one. She Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan, Of whom so often I have heard renown,230 But never saw before, of whom I have Received a second life; and second father This lady makes him to me.ALONSO  I am hers. But, O, how oddly will it sound that I235 Must ask my child forgiveness!PROSPERO  There, sir, stop. Let us not burden our remembrances with A heaviness that’s gone.GONZALO  I have inly wept

240 Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you gods, And on this couple drop a blessèd crown, For it is you that have chalked forth the way Which brought us hither.ALONSO 245 I say “Amen,” Gonzalo.GONZALO  Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice Beyond a common joy, and set it down With gold on lasting pillars: in one voyage250 Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis, And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife Where he himself was lost; Prospero his dukedom In a poor isle; and all of us ourselves When no man was his own.ALONSO, ⌜to Ferdinand and Miranda⌝ 255 Give me your hands. Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart That doth not wish you joy!GONZALO  Be it so. Amen.Enter Ariel, with the Master and Boatswainamazedly following.260 O, look, sir, look, sir, here is more of us. I prophesied if a gallows were on land, This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy, That swear’st grace o’erboard, not an oath on shore?265 Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?BOATSWAIN  The best news is that we have safely found Our king and company. The next: our ship, Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split, Is tight and yare and bravely rigged as when270 We first put out to sea.

ARIEL, ⌜aside to Prospero⌝  Sir, all this service Have I done since I went.PROSPERO, ⌜aside to Ariel⌝  My tricksy spirit!ALONSO  These are not natural events. They strengthen275 From strange to stranger.—Say, how came you hither?BOATSWAIN  If I did think, sir, I were well awake, I’d strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep And—how, we know not—all clapped under280 hatches, Where, but even now, with strange and several noises Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains, And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,285 We were awaked, straightway at liberty, Where we, in all ⌜her⌝ trim, freshly beheld Our royal, good, and gallant ship, our master Cap’ring to eye her. On a trice, so please you, Even in a dream were we divided from them290 And were brought moping hither.ARIEL, ⌜aside to Prospero⌝  Was ’t well done?PROSPERO, ⌜aside to Ariel⌝  Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.ALONSO  This is as strange a maze as e’er men trod, And there is in this business more than nature295 Was ever conduct of. Some oracle Must rectify our knowledge.PROSPERO  Sir, my liege, Do not infest your mind with beating on The strangeness of this business. At picked leisure,300 Which shall be shortly, single I’ll resolve you, Which to you shall seem probable, of every These happened accidents; till when, be cheerful

 And think of each thing well. ⌜Aside to Ariel.⌝ Come hither, spirit;305 Set Caliban and his companions free. Untie the spell. ⌜Ariel exits.⌝ How fares my gracious sir? There are yet missing of your company Some few odd lads that you remember not.Enter Ariel, driving in Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculoin their stolen apparel.STEPHANO 310Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man take care for himself, for all is but fortune. Coraggio, bully monster, coraggio.TRINCULO If these be true spies which I wear in my head, here’s a goodly sight.CALIBAN 315O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed! How fine my master is! I am afraid he will chastise me.SEBASTIAN Ha, ha! What things are these, my Lord Antonio? Will money buy ’em?ANTONIO 320 Very like. One of them Is a plain fish and no doubt marketable.PROSPERO  Mark but the badges of these men, my lords, Then say if they be true. This misshapen knave, His mother was a witch, and one so strong325 That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs, And deal in her command without her power. These three have robbed me, and this demi-devil, For he’s a bastard one, had plotted with them To take my life. Two of these fellows you330 Must know and own. This thing of darkness I Acknowledge mine.CALIBAN  I shall be pinched to death.ALONSO  Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?

SEBASTIAN He is drunk now. Where had he wine?ALONSO 335 And Trinculo is reeling ripe. Where should they Find this grand liquor that hath gilded ’em? ⌜To Trinculo.⌝ How cam’st thou in this pickle?TRINCULO I have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that I fear me will never out of my bones. I340 shall not fear flyblowing.SEBASTIAN Why, how now, Stephano?STEPHANO O, touch me not! I am not Stephano, but a cramp.PROSPERO You’d be king o’ the isle, sirrah?STEPHANO 345I should have been a sore one, then.ALONSO, ⌜indicating Caliban⌝  This is ⌜as⌝ strange ⌜a⌝ thing as e’er I looked on.PROSPERO  He is as disproportioned in his manners As in his shape. ⌜To Caliban.⌝ Go, sirrah, to my cell. Take with you your companions. As you look350 To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.CALIBAN  Ay, that I will, and I’ll be wise hereafter And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass Was I to take this drunkard for a god, And worship this dull fool!PROSPERO 355 Go to, away!ALONSO, ⌜to Stephano and Trinculo⌝  Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.SEBASTIAN Or stole it, rather.⌜Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo exit.⌝PROSPERO  Sir, I invite your Highness and your train To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest360 For this one night, which part of it I’ll waste With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it Go quick away: the story of my life

 And the particular accidents gone by Since I came to this isle. And in the morn365 I’ll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples, Where I have hope to see the nuptial Of these our dear-belovèd solemnized, And thence retire me to my Milan, where Every third thought shall be my grave.ALONSO 370 I long To hear the story of your life, which must Take the ear strangely.PROSPERO  I’ll deliver all, And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales,375 And sail so expeditious that shall catch Your royal fleet far off. ⌜Aside to Ariel.⌝ My Ariel, chick, That is thy charge. Then to the elements Be free, and fare thou well.—Please you, draw near.They all exit.
EPILOGUE,spoken by Prospero.
  Now my charms are all o’erthrown, And what strength I have ’s mine own, Which is most faint. Now ’tis true I must be here confined by you,5 Or sent to Naples. Let me not, Since I have my dukedom got And pardoned the deceiver, dwell In this bare island by your spell, But release me from my bands10 With the help of your good hands. Gentle breath of yours my sails Must fill, or else my project fails, Which was to please. Now I want Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,

The Tempest
EPILOGUE
15 And my ending is despair, Unless I be relieved by prayer, Which pierces so that it assaults Mercy itself, and frees all faults.  As you from crimes would pardoned be,20  Let your indulgence set me free.He exits.
