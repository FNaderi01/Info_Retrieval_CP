    Chapter Text
    “So these agents, they were given the same training as you right?”Five nodded, “Yeah.”“Then why haven’t they tried to escape?”
The boy shook his head, “It’s not that simple. If you’re caught by authorities, you have to stay until The Commission breaks you out.”Diego nodded, “Okay, but why do I have to come with you again?”Five sighed for the tenth time that day, “Because I can’t go in alone.” Diego still looked confused. “Diego, look at me. I’m thirteen. What kind of person in their right mind would let a thirteen year old just walk in and talk with convicted felons?”“Makes sense.”“Why do we have to drive though? We could already be talking with them if you would just let me jump us there.”
Diego shook his head, “Nope. I am not going through that again. My ears were ringing for two days.” They sat in silence for a few minutes before Five turned to Diego trying to hide his fear.“We’re gonna be okay right?”“Yeah, they won’t be able to touch you. You’ll be safe.”Five shook his head, “No, I mean us. Our family. After we take down the crazy couple, you guys are gonna stop fighting. Right?” Diego felt his heart drop. He didn’t realize that their arguing was taking such a toll on the kid. “I hope so. Try to get some sleep. We won’t be there for a few more hours and I know you didn’t sleep last night.”The boy crossed his arms, “I did sleep last night thank you very much.”Diego shook his head smiling, “Nodding off for a few minutes doesn’t count as sleeping, Cinco.”The boy crossed his arms and mumbled to himself, “Yes it does.”“Five, sleep. Now.” Five huffed before resting his head on the window and falling into a dreamless slumber.The teen was awakened by his brother shaking his arm, “Wake up kiddo. We’re here.” Five rubbed his eyes and looked up to see that they were sitting in the parking lot. Diego smirked, “Not tired, huh?” The boy rolled his eyes and got out of the car. Diego sighed and followed. 
He put an arm on Five’s shoulder, “Are you sure you wanna do this? We can always turn around.”Five shook his head, “No, I want to. I have to save to mom.”“What? I thought she was horrible to you.”Five shook his head, “What? No, she took care of me. She treated me like her own. I owe her my life.”“No you don’t Five. She chose that life, you were forced into it.”
He shook his head, “I know, but she was the only family I had. She protected me from Dad. Or the agent who played my dad. I never learned his real name. You gotta remember Diego, I thought I was all alone. Calling the cops on her was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. I wanted to bring her with me, but I knew I couldn’t. I have to do this Diego. I have to save her. I’ll never forgive myself for leaving her; I have to save her.  Diego, she’s my mom in every way that counts.”Diego’s heart shattered for the second time that day. He nodded, “Okay, just remember I’m right behind you.” Five nodded and the two walked into the prison. After Diego gave some sob story about how Five missed his parents and just wanted some closure, and Five’s amazing acting skills, they sat at a metal table waiting for the ‘couple’. A few minutes later the door opened and a woman in chains came in. Five jumped up and ran towards the woman and hugged her, “Mama!” She smiled and hugged back, “Alex? Baby. Look at you, you’ve gotten so big.” She held his face in her hands just looking at the boy she had raised for two years. The guard chained the woman to the table. Five turned towards him, “Where’s my dad?” The guard rolled his eyes, “Chill kid, I’m getting there.” The woman spoke up, “Alex, don’t be rude. He’s just doing his job.”Five nodded and walked to his seat and sat down next to Diego who was letting Five run the show. Another guard walked in with the man who smirked at the boy. He turned towards the guards, “Can you give us a minute? And turn off the mics.” They nodded and left the four to themselves.“Finally Agent Five, it’s been eight years. Why didn’t you travel back to the moment the cops came?”Five shook his head, “I’m not in the business anymore. I just wanted to see how you two were doing. I’ve missed my mom.” He smiled at the woman who smiled back. “And I wanted to see if my dad had been shived yet.”“You little- “ The man jumped to grab the boy forgetting he was chained down. Diego straightened up eyeing the man.The woman spoke up, “Are you okay though? Are you safe from them?”Five nodded and smiled, “Yeah mom I’m okay, and I’m gonna get you,” he glared at the man, “and only you, out of here.”The man was going to speak until he saw Diego playing with his knife.She shook her head, “No baby, don’t risk it. I don’t want them to find you. One of their agents escaping prison would definitely get their attention. All that matters is that you’re okay.” Five walked towards the woman. She cupped his face in her hands, “You’re the only thing that kept me sane. Our line of work is lonely, but you kept me from going crazy. I’m not gonna let you risk your life breaking me out.”  A single tear slid down his face, but she wiped it away. Five shook his head, “Do you remember that crazy couple that went through time kidnapping kids to turn into killers?” She nodded fear evident in her eyes, “Yeah. Agents Tay and Summers killed them.” The boy looked at the woman, “Then why are they after me?” The man smirked, “Because you’re a demon child who has killed more people than twenty snipers put together.” Diego stood up. “Don’t worry about him Dee, I arranged something before I left The Commission.” The boy smirked at the man, “I’m really gonna miss you dad.” Just then four guards came in. Five ran to his ‘mom’ acting scared while Diego hid his knife. “What’s the problem boys? You’ve already been paid for the month.” One of the guards shook his head, “That’s not why we’re here. Your computer time raised a red flag so the prison looked at your history. They tracked a terrorist organization back to your email and the IP address at the same time you were there. They have you sitting there on camera. The screen isn’t visible, but it’s more than enough to send you to maximum until trial.” They unhooked his chains from the table. He jumped towards Five, “You! You did this!” Five ran to ‘mom’ acting terrified of the man while shaking his head, “No I didn’t. Daddy, why would you think that?” The guards grabbed him before he could get to Five. As they took him out of the room Five smirked and waved. He’d finally gotten revenge after years of abuse. He walked back towards mom. Another guard came in and said that their time was up.Five turned to her, “I’ll be back to visit you next month.” She nodded and they hugged. The boy whispered in her ear, “Don’t forget to feed the cat.” She smiled and wiped away a tear, “Be careful and stay safe.” She then turned to Diego, “Keep my boy safe.”He nodded as they both looked at Five, “That’s the job of a big brother.” Five hugged her again as a tear ran down his cheek. She wiped it away, “I love you baby.”He looked at her, “Love you too, Mom.” They watched as a guard took her away before they left. When they neared the car Diego turned to Five, “You okay?” The boy just shook his head and ran to Diego hugging him.“Please don’t let them take me Dee. I know that Allison and them think that I’m safe now, but I know I’m not. That’s what they’re waiting for.”Diego ran a hand through the boy’s hair, “Why didn’t you tell us, Cinco?”The boy shrugged in his brother’s arms, “I dunno. I knew you guys wouldn’t understand and you don’t know what they’re capable of. She does.”Diego sighed and grabbed the boy by the shoulders looking him in the eye, “Hey, look at me. We’re gonna figure this out okay? You’re stuck with us buddy. Okay?”Five nodded, “Okay.”Diego smiled and put an arm around the boy’s shoulder, “Now how about we go get some ice cream then head home?” The boy smiled and nodded.
