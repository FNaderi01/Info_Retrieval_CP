Lifetime’s ‘Surviving R. Kelly’ Delivers 1.9 Million Total Viewers and Ranks as the Largest Social Premiere in Network History            
				By Sentinel News Service                
	                	                Published January 4, 2019
		(Lifetime)
The premiere of Lifetime’s ground-breaking documentary series “Surviving R. Kelly” captivated audiences and commanded the social conversation, delivering 1.9 million Total Viewers and marking Lifetime’s best performance in more than two years in all key demos including Adults 25-54 (1.2 million), Adults 18-49 (1.1 million), Women 25-54 (837,000), and Women 18-49 (767,000), according to Nielsen Media Research. “Surviving R. Kelly” was Lifetime’s best unscripted performance in more than three years in all key demos.
From the first to last half hour, “Surviving R. Kelly” also saw impressive double digit growth in Total Viewers (+18%), Women 18-49 (+19%), Women 25-54 (+16%) and Adults 18-49 (+13%).
“Surviving R. Kelly” also dominated social media, ranking as the #1 most social primetime program across Broadcast and Cable for January 3, excluding sports, according to Nielsen Social Content Ratings. With over 743,000 total interactions across Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, Surviving R. Kelly was Lifetime’s largest social premiere for any series or movie in network history.
        ADVERTISEMENT        
“Surviving R. Kelly” continues tonight, January 4, at 9pm ET/PT, and the final installment of the six-part documentary series will debut on Saturday, January 5, at 9pm ET/PT.
Encore marathons of all six-hours of “Surviving R. Kelly” will air as follows:
Sunday, January 6 starting at 10am on Lifetime
Sunday, January 6 starting at 6pm on LMN
Friday, January 11 starting at 6pm on Lifetime
In “Surviving R. Kelly,” women are emerging from the shadows and uniting their voices to share their stories. Celebrated as one of the greatest R&amp;B singers of all time, R. Kelly’s genre defining career and playboy lifestyle has been riddled with rumors of abuse, predatory behavior, and pedophilia. Despite damning evidence and multiple witnesses, to date, none of these accusations have seemingly affected him. For the first time ever, survivors and people from R. Kelly’s inner circle, are coming forward with new allegations about his sexual, mental, and physical abuse. They are now finally ready to share their full story and shed light on the secret life the public has never seen.
With over 50 interviews including civil rights activist Tarana Burke, musicians John Legend and Sparkle, talk-show host and former DJ Wendy Williams, ex-wife Andrea Kelly, ex-girlfriend Kitti Jones, brothers Carey and Bruce Kelly, and many others, the true story of R. Kelly’s controversial past will be revealed beginning in 1970 through present day, shedding light on the R&amp;B star whose history of alleged abuse of underage African American girls has, until recently, been largely ignored by mainstream media.
“Surviving R. Kelly” is executive produced by cultural critic, filmmaker and passionate activist dream hampton, Tamara Simmons, Joel Karlsberg and Jesse Daniels for Kreativ Inc. which has a production deal with Bunim/Murray Productions (BMP), and Brie Miranda Bryant from Lifetime. This program falls under Lifetime’s commitment to provide a platform to give women a voice where they have previously been unheard to bring awareness to the abuses and harassment of women.
