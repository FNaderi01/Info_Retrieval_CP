Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation Partners With City Of Compton Parks &amp; Recreation Department To Expand Youth Baseball And Softball To 360 Additional Participants This Year            
				By Sentinel News Service                
	                	                Published March 29, 2019
		2019 Dodgers RBI Program Will Serve 10,500 Youth Across 85 Locations With New Elements To Include College Preparation Workshops, Trauma Informed Coach Training, and Increased Law Enforcement Participation
The Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation (LADF) announced today that it will partner with the City of Compton Parks &amp; Recreation Department to expand youth baseball and softball to an additional 360 participants this year. The City of Compton Parks &amp; Recreation Department will join 12 existing partners to implement LADF’s Dodgers RBI program to 10,500 youth at 85 locations in the neighborhoods of Compton, East Los Angeles, Northeast Los Angeles, Inglewood, Hawthorne, Harbor City, Cudahy, Florence-Firestone, South Los Angeles, Long Beach and Lynwood. Details for each location can be found at Dodgers.com/dodgersrbi.

“It’s incredibly hard for youth from low income families to participate in sports. Sports participation matters because of the effects it has on the social, emotional and physical well-being of our youth. Dodgers RBI is all about offering youth who want to play, regardless of income, a chance,” said LADF Chief Executive Officer, Nichol Whiteman. “We know that cities like Compton benefit from our comprehensive sport, education and health programming and we are pleased to welcome them into our youth development family.”
With an annual median income of $45,000 and 30% of families living below $20,000 a year, Compton is not only low for Los Angeles County, but also well below the United States median income. Children from households with incomes less than $25,000 annually are three times more likely to be physically inactive as kids from high-income homes. Baseball participation is 8% below the national average and the college graduation rate is below 10%. Compton has one of the highest African American populations in Los Angeles County (29.83%). Dodgers RBI places emphasis on increasing participation amongst African American youth, girls and youth ages 13-18.
Trayce Thompson talks to a group od Dodgers RBI players(Jon SooHoo/ L.A. Dodgers).
“The City of Compton is excited to partner with the Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation to provide Dodgers RBI to the youth of Compton,” said Marvin Hunt, Director Department of Parks &amp; Recreation. “The ongoing partnership will provide a revitalized program of baseball, tee-ball, and softball to Compton youth. This is a beautiful celebration of sportsmanship and a symbol of unity.”
In addition to youth baseball and softball, Dodgers RBI helps increase access to education, literacy, health, wellness and recreational resources in underserved communities. New for 2019, the Dodgers RBI program will include college preparation workshops, trauma informed coach training and increased law enforcement participation. Twenty (20) college workshops for 9-12th graders will be customized to each grade level and feature separate parent and student components. In addition, LADF will be granting Dodgers RBI players a special opportunity to meet one-on-one with a college advisor to assist with college selection, preparation and financing. Coach trainings will not only outline the physical skills needed to teach baseball, but it will instill positive coaching methods and techniques appropriate for youth who have experienced any level of trauma. Over 150 law enforcement officials will participate in college workshops, clinics and more.
In addition to Gold Sponsor Bank of America, 2019 partnering corporations and organizations include:
·       Program Sponsors – 99 Cents Only Stores, ARCO, California Resources Corporation, IBEW Local 11, Southern California Pipe Trades, Helen and Will Webster Foundation, LA84 Foundation, Los Angeles County Department of Public Works, Los Angeles County Department of Water and Power, California Masonic Foundation, Under Armour Freedom Initiative, and UCLA Health
·       Program Partners – American Heart Association, Cal Ripken, Sr. Foundation, California State University, Los Angeles, California State University, Northridge, Dasani, Farmer John, Gatorade, LeagueApps, Los Angeles Dodgers Training Academy, Los Angeles Lakers Youth Foundation, Loyola Marymount University, Pepperdine University, Pitch in For Baseball and Softball, Positive Coaching Alliance Los Angeles, Read Conmigo, State Farm, Up2Us Sports, University of Southern California, and Vision to Learn.
