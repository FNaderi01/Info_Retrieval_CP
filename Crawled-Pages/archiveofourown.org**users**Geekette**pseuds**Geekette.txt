    Summary
      When little Harry started out at Hogwarts he didn't fit in per say. So he did what anyone would do; he researched. Even after finding out that he was in fact trans, he kept on going, reading anything he got his hands on. Only in secret though. If the Dursley's taught him-no, her anything it was not to stand out, which was hard for the Boy-Who-Lived.She found the courage to talk to her friends about her being transgender. They shut her down.She asked Dumbledore for help, as well as telling him about the Dursley's abuse. He just gave her a patronising look and told her she was being silly.Year after year she asked. Eventually she was told it wouldn't happen. That she was being selfish and that the priority was Voldemort.So when she confronts Voldemort in the Ministry, she doesn't hold back.The story of how Harry went "Fuck the world" and became Aria Lily Potter.

    Summary
      Basically. The wizarding world isn't just black and white. More grey. The 'good' guys aren't perfect (case in point James’ three bastard daughters). The 'bad' guys have families they care about.Obviously, Voldemort and Umbitch are still completely evil.Tales of pureblood culture, wizarding politics and a world of grey mainly through the eyes of Lord Roderick Lestrange, son of Rodolphus and Bellatrix, and Rosetta (Rose) Evans the bastard daughter of Lily and Severus.Nobody is perfect in this fic, fair warning.So all in all if you’re up for a long story addressing politics, morals and mental illness this is the story for you. Fair warning the tags on this fic will almost certainly get progressively darker as time goes by.

    Summary
      The quarry... the farm... the prison... each lost in turn.  But they left Alexandria behind because it was clear their kind weren't welcome.  The looks, the whispers, it was too much like the world before.  So they set out to find a new home, one where they'll be welcome.  And with only the vaguest destination in mind, they set out.  How far will they get?  And will they find a place to call home?  Does such a place even exist for them?
