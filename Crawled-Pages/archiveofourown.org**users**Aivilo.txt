    Summary
      Harry Potter saves Bulgarian Quidditch star Viktor Krum from an early death when Death Eaters invade the Quidditch World Cup campsite. From there, a friendship (and something more) blooms, turning everything on its head. New friends are made, old friends are lost, secrets are revealed, and the fate of Wizarding Britain is forever altered.
