                 Mini Bio
                A Reader Is Me is a reading challenge community similar to 52 Books in 52 Weeks or the Cannonball Read, but with one major difference.  In this challenge, you set your own goals and then it's up to you to meet them.In a nutshell, you get to pick how many books you want to read, how much time you want to take to read them, and what defines "book" for the purposes of your goal. You'll keep track of your progress by posting about each book you've read on the community. Hopefully, we'll all do our best to encourage one another and it will be a fun time for all.The details are  here.I've done up a couple of forms/templates for you to use when you post.  I'm using myself as an example. Feel free to rework them, but the information not listed as optional must be in there somewhere.Intro postName: telesillaGoal: 100 books read between September '08 -- September '09Definition of "book": 200 pages or more, graphic novels do not count, re-reads are okayBooks read so far: (optional; use this if you're continuing a goal set earlier) 23A little about my goal and my reading habits: (optional) I'm carrying this over from Pajiba's Cannonball Read. I faded after an impressive start because, while I love competition, this was too much for me and I felt pressured. I read pretty much anything that comes to hand, but I concentrate on historical fiction, science fiction and fantasy.Book Post:Title: Empress (Godspeaker Book One)Author: Karen MillerNumber of Pages: (optional) 717Genre: (optional) FantasyBook Number/Goal:  23 of 100 to be read in a yearReview:  (optional; you can post a review on the comm or a link to one somewhere else) The review on my blog.
