	    UNIVERSAL CITY, CA, October 17, 2011 — Universal Pictures announced today that the studio has forged a significant three-year, first-look production agreement with Suzanne de Passe and Madison Jones’ de Passe Jones Entertainment (depassejones.com).  The announcement was made by Universal Pictures Chairman Adam Fogelson and Co-Chairman Donna Langley.
“Suzanne and Madison are trailblazing producers who have great respect in multiple divisions of the entertainment industry,” said Fogelson and Langley.  “We are fortunate to work with such respected partners and look forward to their upcoming projects with the studio.”
de Passe and Jones merged their entertainment companies several years ago and are currently developing and producing a wide variety of film, television, music and new media projects. One of de Passe Jones’ priority projects is the definitive film on the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., which they are developing with Steven Spielberg at DreamWorks.  The company  has just published its first graphic novel through its new imprint,  REVENGER COMICS, distributed by IDW Publishing.  Additionally, Jones and de Passe Executive Produced the critically acclaimed President Obama’s 2009 Commander in Chief’s Inaugural Ball.
“We are excited and honored to have the  opportunity to work  closely with the immensely talented team of executives at Universal to produce films in a variety of genres,” said de Passe and Jones in a joint statement.  “We believe the next few years will be a wonderful, creative adventure, and we are looking forward to getting started.”
Suzanne de Passe is widely recognized for successful television and film titles and served as the executive producer of the iconic mini-series Lonesome Dove.  She has been recognized with a number of awards and honors including an Academy Award® nomination for co-writing Lady Sings the Blues, won two Emmy Awards, 30 Emmy Nominations, a Golden Globe Award, five NAACP Image Awards, three Peabody Awards, The Women in Film Crystal Award and The Revlon Business Woman of the Year Award.  She is the subject of two Harvard Business School case studies.
Phillip “Madison” Jones began working in the entertainment industry at HBO in Film Acquisition, Sports, Comedy, Documentary and Family divisions.  He was the founder and CEO of IPM, an entertainment, media and IP licensing firm that developed projects with Time Warner under an output deal.  His company spearheaded the highly successful global licensing program for the estate of Martin Luther King, Jr. in the areas of media and entertainment, book publishing and IP licensing.  He was nominated for an Emmy Award as executive producer of the animated special Our Friend Martin featuring the voices of Oprah Winfrey, Samuel L. Jackson, and John Travolta.  In addition to creative endeavors, Jones has negotiated deals with many Fortune 500 companies including Apple, Microsoft, The Coca-Cola Company as well as most of the major television networks and film studios.
Senior development executives Suzanne Coston and Brett King will be receiving submissions on behalf of de Passe Jones Entertainment.

			Um, what the heck?  The studios are cutting back on deals and this company, which has never produced a feature ever, gets a first look?  There is more to this than a press release…

			Wait a sec, this is a film deal?

			Adam Fogelson needs to get off the drugs! what a bunch of crap…talk about spin… What major award winning projects have these two done…and who is this madison? He’s a joke. love the intimidating picture. we’re done laughing.
			Comment by ouropinion — Monday October 17, 2011 @ 7:47pm EDT  Reply to this post
			Enough already with MLK movies, slave movies, and the rest of that crap! Why are black filmmakers so stuck on the same story?  Sheesh…can’t they come up with something original and (shocker) contemporary? With all her experience and contacts, Ms. DePasse can’t come up with a better project?

			is de passe doing to andy fogelson what she did with barry gordy years ago?
			Comment by unkle — Monday October 17, 2011 @ 11:25pm EDT  Reply to this post
			what are you fools talking about? This is great…Hollywood needs some fresh faces in the game, because most of the movies that are coming out now suck.
			Comment by Lopsau — Monday October 17, 2011 @ 11:49pm EDT  Reply to this post
			Wow, these two individuals are well respected and have a ton of experience and knowledge in the entertainment industry. Maybe the individuals commenting on the current press release should first pull up IMDB and then respond. Now I see why Universal gave de Passe Jones the deal. HATERS
			Comment by John Sander — Tuesday October 18, 2011 @ 12:30am EDT  Reply to this post
			I agree with John Sanders and Lopsau. Suzanne Depasse is a Hollywood Icon starting with discovering the Jackson 5 and skyrocketing in the music industry during a time when African American and women were not given many opportunities, to winning a million awards, not to mention an oscar nod, and now taking the film industry by full storm! And Obviously Madison Jones is an intelligent hardworking, soon to be famous everywhere, individual if Depasse decided to join forces with him. THANK GOD UNiversal has opened their eyes to other people in this Industry… maybe we can see some original films be produced, not like ANOTHER REMAKE or a PREQUEL to an already existing hit movie.
