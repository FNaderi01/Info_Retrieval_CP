As we explained previously, the archive is random and not a complete list of every work produced for the eventWe are not affiliated with the whumptober-2020 blog that has popped up. While we totally support side competitions, using the same name as our event is not appreciated and we will not be reblogging content produced for this parallel event.¬†We‚Äôre going to start tagging all archived posts with¬†‚Äúarchive‚Äù if you would like to continue following the blog but don‚Äôt necessarily want to see all the archived posts on your dash. To avoid confusion with the other event, we recommend using the tag #whumptober2020 without the space.Please read the FAQs before sending us an ask, especially now that the event is running and we‚Äôre swamped.All the 2020 Event Info that was pinned to the top of the page is now under the cut below so you don‚Äôt have to scroll past that big ol post when you visit.You can also visit our nifty little official Event Info page!Happy Whumping!Keep reading

                                                            if you don't mind me asking, is it okay to like, draw/write/edit for one fandom (or more)? or do we have to participate from variations of fandoms?
                                                        There‚Äôs no requirement like that. Be sure to read the FAQs first. Your question is answered there.

                                                            Does the fic need to focus around the actual whump event as the main action of the fic, or is it okay to focus the fic on the fallout/recovery (it's not really comfort) from one of the prompts, as long as the whump event happens/takes place in the fic? E.g. If someone is shot/blinded/etc according to the prompts, it takes place at the beginning of the fic and the rest of the fic is their time in the hospital and then learning to live with their injury.
                                                        That‚Äôs perfectly acceptable and explained in our FAQ post. Good luck work your fic!
