Rep. Waters Announces CARES Act Grants for Metro, Torrance Transit and Gardena GTrans            
				By Sentinel News Service                
	                	                Published August 10, 2020
		LOS ANGELES – Congresswoman Maxine Waters (CA-43), Chair of the House Financial Services Committee (FSC), announced that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) provided grants to each of the three transit agencies that serve her congressional district.  The grants were funded by the CARES Act, a $2 trillion economic security package that included several provisions drafted by Congresswoman Waters in her capacity as the Chair of FSC. 
“I am proud to announce that Torrance Transit, Gardena’s GTrans, and Metro all received grants to help them recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their operations,” said Congresswoman Waters.  “These funds will help the transit agencies continue to pay the salaries of their workers, maintain safe operations, and provide public transportation services throughout my district despite this terrible pandemic.”
The FTA provided the following grants to the three transit agencies that serve the 43rd district:
$7,910,110 for the City of Torrance’s Torrance Transit.
$6,650,248 for the City of Gardena’s GTrans system.
$861,910,265 for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro).
“I am especially proud that these grants were funded by the historic CARES Act,” said Congresswoman Waters.  “As Chair of the Financial Services Committee, I fought to ensure that this $2 trillion economic security package included a broad range of initiatives to invest in housing, transportation, and other infrastructure and to help families, support essential workers, and maintain public services like transit.  I am pleased that this landmark legislation is supporting the transit agencies in my district.”
The CARES Act provided a total of $25 billion for public transit agencies nationwide, $3.75 billion of which is for the state of California.
“Public transportation plays a vital role in our society,” said Congresswoman Waters.  “Even in the midst of the current pandemic, transit agencies facilitate travel for doctors, nurses, first responders, and other essential workers.  While stopping the spread of COVID-19 necessitates that Americans avoid all but the most essential use of public transportation, we must nevertheless ensure that all of our nation’s transit systems are able to pay their workers and continue to operate in a safe manner.”
