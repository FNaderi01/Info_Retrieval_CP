                 Mini Bio
                I am an archaeologist living in the Pacific Northwest. My main hobby is writing. I used to draw and customize dolls, but haven't done so in quite a while. Every so often you might find pictures of places I’ve traveled to or scenes from work. I like to visit historic places and be out in nature.I mostly talk about real life stuff in my journal. If you want to subscribe to me, you are more than welcome to, even if we don't have anything in common. Commenting on my one public post is helpful but not required.There are a variety of fandoms I'm into, and I don't seem to have any "main" fandoms right now. However, I'm interested in manga, anime, manhwa, light novels, and movies of the Western genre. A lot of my fandoms are small and/or obscure.I should mention that I sometimes talk about my mom, who is an alcoholic, and I sometimes go into detail about it, so if topics about alcohol/drinking, alcoholism, or addiction in general is triggering for you or just plain uncomfortable, then you may not want to add me.
