    Summary
      The Hidden Leaf Village in Naruto's time seems to have forgotten just why the village was founded and have lost their way. Through a mishap with a hiraishin seal, Tobirama finds himself during Naruto's time and he is having none of this nonsense. His brother may be gone, but he won't stand to have Hashirama's dream trampled so.And if he has to cause a civil war or burn the village down to the ground? Well that depends on how much resistance he meets.All Tobirama does know for certain is that no child will suffer underneath the protection of Konoha and if he has to take them in and care for them himself, then he will.

    Summary
      Geralt is given firm instructions from Vesemir: He is to get married to a Redanian noblewoman in the hopes of improving relations between witchers and the rest of the world. Once the ceremony is over, he plans to drop his new spouse off at their new home and carry on with his life as he always has. Little does he know, his future wife is not a woman, and not so easily left behind. He's not really sure he'd like to get rid of Jaskier, either. Over the next several years, they learn to navigate their new relationship, first while Jaskier completes his degree, and then when Jaskier insists on accompanying him on the road. And no matter what anyone else has to say about it, Geralt is absolutely not in love with his husband.

    Creator Chose Not To Use Archive WarningsPeter Hale/Stiles StilinskiStiles Stilinski Peter Hale Original Characters Scott McCall (Teen Wolf) Gerard ArgentPost-Season/Series 02 Alternate Universe - Canon Divergence Revenge Murder Murder Husbands Road Trips Bad Friend Scott McCall (Teen Wolf) No Alpha Pack Magical Stiles Stilinski Spark Stiles Stilinski Steter Secret Santa 2019 Don't copy to another site Human Alpha Stiles Stilinski
    Summary
      Just because Scott refuses to see the Argents for what they truly are - prejudiced serial killers sitting proudly on a mountain of innocent corpses - doesn't mean Stiles will. It's about time someone did something about the Argent Empire anyway, and what a coincidence - summer vacation is just around the corner.--Or, the one where Gerard Argent kidnapped the wrong fucking person to torture. Stiles has never subscribed to the policy of forgiving and forgetting anyway, not when razing the problem to the ground and salting the earth for good measure has always been a far better solution in the long run.He doesn't expect to have company.
