                 Mini Bio
                I'm not really good at filling out these things...Well, I'm Nova, also known at some locations as ClericalRodent. I love animated shows and I'm always obsessed with one or another of them. I'm also a doller, which is my main hobby. Though right now I'm on a longer hiatus. You're free to friend me if you want, but if you do it outside of a friending meme, then please send me a message introducing yourself, as I have the friend notification off and simply won't notice you otherwise.
