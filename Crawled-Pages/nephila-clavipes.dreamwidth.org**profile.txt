                 Mini Bio
                Salutations.Shae. 28. INTP. Scientist. Creepy. Audiophile. Endearingly Neurotic. Been mopping the deck of the Drarry ship since 2003. Took a break from the fandom, as well as art altogether, while in college, but now I have reemerged ready to sharpen my forgone art skills while losing myself in the comfort that is the Harry Potter fandom.      SLYTHERIN{ wear }
