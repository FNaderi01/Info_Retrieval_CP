Monthly online seminars on Tuesdays, starting in September 2020,
8 AM New York, 1 PM London, 2 PM Milan/Paris/Frankfurt, 8 PM Singapore/Shanghai
We are delighted to announce that the CEPR Network on Financial Economics is launching a virtual seminar series at the start of the academic year.
The CEPR Advanced Forum for Financial Economics (CAFFE) will be organized by Laurent Calvet, Kim Peijnenburg, and Raman Uppal from EDHEC Business School. Its objective is to make cutting-edge finance research available to researchers based in Europe and around the world.
There will be one seminar each month covering all topics in Financial Economics. The seminar is open to all participants but special emphasis will be placed on European-based researchers working on novel issues such as the financial implications of Covid-19.  We view this seminar series as a joint venture of all researchers in Financial Economics and we very much look forward to your wholehearted and enthusiastic support.
Each seminar will run for 75 minutes, with 40 minutes allocated to the speaker, 20 minutes to a discussant, and 15 minutes for questions from the audience. The seminar starts just after lunch at 2PM CET (1PM London time), so have your caffè during CAFFE!
