Health Equity Monitor

Monitoring health inequalities is crucial to identify differences in health between different population subgroups. This provides evidence on who is being left behind and informs health policies, programmes and practices that aim to close existing gaps and achieve health equity. The WHO Health Equity Monitor provides evidence on existing health inequalities and makes available tools and resources for health inequality monitoring.
