Etymology[edit]
The word latke is derived (via Yiddish) from the East Slavic word oladka, a diminutive from oladya, "small pancake".[2][3] The Slavic word derives from Ancient Greek ἐλάδιον, diminutive of ἔλαιον, "olive oil", "oily substance".[2][3][4]
The word levivah (לביבה), the Hebrew name for latke, refers in the Book of Samuel to a dumpling made from kneaded dough, as part of the story of Amnon and Tamar.[5] Some interpreters have noted that the homonym levav (לבב) means "heart," and the verbal form of l-v-v occurs in the Song of Songs as well. In the lexicon of Ashkenazi Jews from Udmurtia and Tatarstan there are recorded versions of the kosher-style appellation of latkes during the eight-day Hanukkah holiday.[6]
History[edit]
First variants of latkes go back to at least the Middle Ages.[2] They were probably made of cheese (probably either ricotta or curd cheese), fried in poppyseed oil or butter, served with fruit preserves, and these cheese latkes were the most common kind of latke in Ashkenazi communities until the 19th century (when the potato arrived in eastern Europe).[2][3][7][8] However, at the time, the cheapest and most readily available cooking fat was schmaltz, rendered poultry fat (usually from a goose or chicken), and due to Jewish dietary laws, which prohibit the mixing of meat and dairy products, alternatives to the cheese latke arrived. These included buckwheat or rye flour, or other tubers endemic to the region, such as turnips.[9] However, once the potato became popularized in eastern Europe, it was quickly included as a latke ingredient and became so popular that today, the word latke is almost synonymous with potatoes.[2]
Variations[edit]
Latkes today are traditionally made with potatoes, although other vegetables are also sometimes used, albeit less frequently. Potato remains the most popular variety of latke. There are two main varieties of potato latkes, those made with grated potato and those made with puréed or mashed potato. The textures of these two varieties are very different.
Grated potato version[edit]
  Latkes made of grated potatoes with onions
Latkes made of grated potatoes are the most traditional version and are still very popular. They are prepared by grating potatoes and onions with a box grater or food processor, and excess moisture is squeezed out. Eggs and flour or matzo meal are then mixed with the potatoes, and the latkes are fried in batches in an oiled pan. The thickness depends on personal preference.
Puréed potato version[edit]
This version of latke is made with pureed potatoes. As with the aforementioned grated potato version, potatoes and onions are grated, and are added to egg and matzo meal. But in this version the ingredients are then processed in a food processor until a pureed consistency is attained. This form of latke is easier to shape, and according to Jewish chef Jamie Geller, they have a “pudding-like consistency.”[10]
Other variations[edit]
Latkes need not necessarily be made from potatoes. Prior to the introduction of the potato to the Old World, latkes were and in some places still are, made from a variety of other vegetables, cheeses, legumes, or starches, depending on the available local ingredients and foods of the various places where Jews lived.[11] Numerous modern recipes call for the addition of ingredients such as onions and carrots.[12][13] Daily variations on a simple potato latka might include zucchini, sweet onion and gruyere (for french onion flavor) and some variations made with sweet potatoes.[14]
In popular culture[edit]
Latkes are a traditional food consumed by Ashkenazi Jews during Hanukkah, and have featured prominently in Jewish, Israeli and general American culture.
Latke, the Lucky Dog is a 2012 children’s book about Hanukkah that features latkes and a dog named after the iconic Jewish food.
In the film Eight Crazy Nights (an American Hannukah film by Adam Sandler), latkes are featured prominently and can be seen in various scenes; they are eaten by several characters in the film.
The novel American Psycho mentions latkes briefly in a scene where protagonist Patrick Bateman is mockingly offered some by his colleague Preston.
In the film The Hebrew Hammer, the title character is seen eating latkes and makes a number of latke-related puns.
