    Chapter Text
    The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harriet her longest-ever punishment. By the time she was allowed out of her cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.Harriet was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s favorite sport: Harriet Hunting.This was why Harriet spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where she could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came she would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in her life, she wouldn’t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harriet, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.“They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,” he told Harriet. “Want to come upstairs and practice?”“No, thanks,” said Harry. “I would rather not have to explain to Aunt Petunia why your head is stuck in her toilet” she ran off before he could fully understand what she had said. One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harriet at Mrs. Figg’s. Mrs. Figg wasn’t as bad as usual. It turned out she’d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn’t seem quite as fond of them as before which meant Harriet got to take up the prime job of giving them pets. She let Harriet watch television and gave her a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she’d had it for several years after telling her she looked too thin.That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand new uniform. Smeltings’ boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren’t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn’t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harriet didn’t trust herself to speak. She thought two of her tongue would bleed from how hard she bit it to keep in her thoughts. Aunt Petunia gave her a cross look as she entered the kitchen that morning, in her hands were bundles of fresh fabric of all different kinds. “These are for your clothes next year girl. You don’t have a dress code like my Dudley, but you know how you are expected to dress” her aunt handed her the fabric, taking extra care not to look into her eyes as she did so. Harriet nodded quirky “I know, don’t worry”Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because Harriet was in view. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table. They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.“Get the mail, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.“Make Harriet get it.”“Get the mail, Harriet.”“Make Dudley get it.”“Poke her with your Smelting stick, Dudley.” Harriet dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and — a letter for Harriet. Harriet picked it up and stared at it, her heart aching with sudden longing. No one, ever, in her whole life, had written to her. Who would?She had no friends, no other relatives — she didn’t belong to the library no matter how many times she begged her aunt to take her to one, so she’d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:Ms. H. PotterThe Cupboard under the Stairs4 Privet DriveLittle WhingingSurreyThe envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp. Turning the envelope over, her hands both trembling harshly, Harriet saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H. “Hurry up, girl!” shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. “What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?” He chuckled at his own joke. Harry went back to the kitchen, only after tucking the letter she got into one of the pockets she had sewn into her dress. She handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and clung to her envelope in her pocket with all of her might while she tried her best not to be seen. Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard. “Marge’s ill,” he informed Aunt Petunia. “Ate a funny whelk...”“Could I go to my room Aunt Petunia, I would like to get an early start on making some dresses for next year with these lovely fabrics. Thank you again by the way” Harriet asked as she picked up the bolts of brightly colored fabric. Her aunt hummed slightly before saying “Thinking of your room, its high time we move you into the second guest bedroom. You are a young lady now and it would be seen as inappropriate to any guests we have over if they saw you tucked under the stairs. That will be your job today, moving your things into that room. Then you will of course still have to do all of your chores around the house and help me with dinner, don't you think that’s fair love?” she turned to Vernon with a pleasant smile. “Yes, dear. Always so smart you are, we can’t have people asking any questions about the girl. She can move herself in today while we are out with my family to celebrate Dudley’s acceptance into Smeltings Academy like any good Dursley would” Vernon said with as much of a contemplative look as he could muster. Ah, that must be why they were letting her move rooms, in case his relatives wanted to visit. They would probably have many questions as to why Harriet slept under the stairs and the Dursleys hated questions. Petunia smiled wide at her husband “Of course” she then turned to Harriet and let her depression turn sour “Well then, girl, get a move on. You still have to finish all of your chores after you move your things”Harriet nodded quickly and shoved the rest of the fruit on her plate into her mouth before scurrying into her cupboard. She immediately shoved the letter from her pocket into the box with all of her clothes. She then hoisted the box onto her hip before walking up to the guest bedroom that she had cleaned so many times before. The room looked like it always did though it gave her a different feeling now. It had a large bed with a fluffy cotton duvet and four pillows that she always had to mess with before a guest would come over, but now she was the one that would be resting on that bed. In one corner of the room was a dresser, she had never had a dresser and was excited to fill it with all of the clothes she made for herself, and on the other side of the room sat a desk, her very own desk. Looking over her shoulder to double-check that her door was closed, Harriet pulled the letter out from her box of clothes and set it on her desk. Her hands shook as she looked at it for a long moment before picking it back up and opening it. There were two pages inclosed inside the envelope, the first one read:“Dear Ms.Potter,We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.This Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July.Yours sincerely,Minerva McGonagallDeputy Headmistress”Harriet blinked, once, twice, then a third time before reading over the first page of the letter again and suddenly everything that had ever happened to her fell into place in her mind and made sense. The people only she could see, those that would disappear before her very eyes the moment after they introduced themselves to her, all of the accidents that happened around her when she was upset, hell everything that had ever happened around her, it all made sense. Or this was some mean joke made by the kids at her school whispered that she was a witch when she would come running out of the forest after school, she hoped it was the former, she hoped she was truly magical. A beat of absolute optimism fell over Harriet for the first time in her life, she had never let herself feel so rawly hopeful before, but then it crashed down around her as she realized with dread that she would have to tell The Dursleys, the king, and queen of normalcy, that she was to go to a school for witchcraft. Then there was of course the fact that she didn’t have an owl too-Then Harriet saw it, or rather him. An owl had perched itself on the window that led into her new room, it looked at her expectantly then looked down at her letter. She nodded her head as she pulled a piece of parchment and a pen out of the desks drawer and began to write: “Dear Deputy Headmistress,I would first and foremost like to thank you sincerely for the opportunity to go to your school. I'd be more than grateful to attend this coming term, but I do have a bit of a situation. You see, I’m not quite sure how to get any of the supplies that you listed, nor do I have any money to my name to purchase them. I was wondering if there was any way that the school could loan me some supplies that I could return at the end of term, or if any staff would be willing to take me to wherever I can purchase my supplies once I find a way to pay for them. I’m so sorry for any inconvenience that this may place on you, but I can’t ask my current guardians for help on the matter. They have a distinct hatred for anything out of the usual, I learned quite a long time ago to not bring up anything that would set their sights on me so if there is any way you could help me with figuring out a way to explain all of this to them without them locking me away till I starve to death I would be eternally grateful to you. I am once again sorry if this causes you or your staff any problems. I hope to hear back from you soon and really hope this isn’t a prank of some kind because if it is I’ll cry. Thank you for your time.Sincerely, Harriet Daisy Potter”Harriet quickly fouled the letter before putting it in an envelope and writing the school’s name alongside the deputy headmistress’s title on the side before slowly opening her window. Peaking out front she could see that her Uncle’s car was gone meaning they had left without telling her, causing her to smile slightly before she turned to the bird that had been staring intently upon her. It tilted its head at her slightly before lifting up one of its feat which had a bit of string wrapped around it. Harriet steadily, or as steadily as she could with how her nerves wrecked through her, attached her letter to the owl’s leg while staring it down in hopes to be able to move back if it portrayed any sense of discomfort. Instead of scratching her or screeching the owl looked oddly bored, at least as bored as an owl can look, as it watched her just as closely. “Erm- If you would give that letter to Deputy Headmistress McGonagall I would be very thankful” Harriet muttered to the bird, not quite sure if she should feel silly or not after she had tightly fashioned her letter to it. It cawed back at her in a manner that felt far too human to Harriet before it flew off into the distance causing her to let out the breath she had been holding before shaking her head. Harriet still had work to do, even if she was a witch. God- was she a witch? A cold hand clapped over her mouth scaring her for the second before she realized it was her own. Shaking her head she turned and walked down the steep stairs of her guardians' home. She quickly moved what little things she had into her new room before going to do her daily chores. To clean the house first Harriet would dust everything in the house, then she would sweep the floors, then she would vacuum the carpets, next she would mop the floors and scrub the surfaces around the house clean. Once she got all of that done she would clean every bedroom in the house then start in the garden. The hot summer sun would be about halfway down the sky when she had finally finished up on grooming her Aunt’s garden, she could practically hear the woman bragging to her friends about all of the hard work she put into her roses when it was actually all Harriet’s work. Harriet let out a low sigh as she wiped the sweat from her brow as she glanced about the garden for any mistakes when she saw it. The owl from before swooped into the bedroom, her bedroom she corrected herself, ‘s window with a letter before popping out of it to sit on the roof. A smile flew to the small girl’s lips as she quickly ran into her ‘home’ and up into her new room. Sitting on her new desk was a yellow envelope in the same style that the envelope she stole away this morning was. Once again there could be no mistake as to who the letter was for: Ms. H. Daisy PotterHer New Bedroom Down The Hall4 Privet DriveLittle WhingingSurreyHarriet quickly flipped the letter over and popped open the wax seal that held it closed. With once again shaking hands she pulled out the letter, this time only one page and from a distance, it looked less robotically written. It read:“Dear Miss Potter,We are ever so sorry to hear that your current residence would not allow you to go to our establishment”Harriet held her breath, tears rimming her eyes already as she accepted the fact that they were about to let her down or tell her it was all a joke. “But we are pleased to inform you that you will still be able to go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I was told many years ago that Hogwarts is a home to all that wish for it to be so I will personally come to your home tomorrow to both help explain a little fib to your guardians as well as take you to Diagon Alley to get your things. I will see you soon and can’t wait to teach you.Yours sincerely,Minerva McGonagallDeputy Headmistress”Harriet let a sigh push from her lips as her tears finally rolled down her face, it was real. This was all real. She was a witch and a witch was coming to save her from hell, surely the pastor would be upset with her verbiage, but it is the best way to put it
        Notes:
          Sorry for the shorter chapter and the slow update. I've been a bit busy with college, but I'm really excited to write this fic. Next chapter will be pretty long any way. also, Hagrid fans, don't worry your little heads. Our boy will also be in next chapter, its just gonna be different from cannon. I hope you all have lovely week ends and I appreciate comments cause I love making new friends!!
  Notes:
  I tried, I'm, so sorry if it was bad. I will try to update soon, but I am a college freshman so I don't know my schedule all that well yet. My main goal with this fic is to show that people can heal cause I'm still reminding myself that I can heal.
