    Summary
      Adjusting to a world where they never existed isn't easy. Adjusting to one where they were found wanting and replaced, doubly so. But with the world at stake (again), the Umbrella siblings are resolved to make the most of their new situation.Then, on a mission that should have been insultingly easy, some of them start to show familiar symptoms. Denial, itching, extreme thirst--Maybe there's another reason why the Umbrella Academy didn't exist in this timeline.(Can be read on its own)
