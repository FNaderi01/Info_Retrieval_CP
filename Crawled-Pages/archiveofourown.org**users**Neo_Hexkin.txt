    Summary
      Part 1 of 2.No one ever said an SI gets a place in canon events, or that they would be ideally placed at all. How much would you recall if you had decades to go before anything in a long forgotten story comes to be? SI/OC as part of the Russian Mafiya, liberties taken with crafting said Mafiya Family.

    Summary
      There was something odd about Tsunayoshi. Reborn had read the reports that Iemitsu had provided him. While he didn't outright say it, Reborn knew that Iemitsu was disappointed that his son had, in Iemitsu's own words, 'turned out strange'.

    Summary
      Sawada Tsunayoshi's happiness crumbled within the span of a half-year. Events led from one to another, up until he was the sole survivor of a conflict that destroyed Vongola and their enemy. Tired and grieving, he accepted death. But instead of ending up in the afterlife and in the company of his family, he finds himself in the form of his 14-year-old, "Dame" self. Time Travel.
