    Summary
      Hitoshi never thought he would be able to reach this point. At UA, in the heroic course, with friends that weren't afraid of his quirk and every day getting one step closer to becoming a pro. And all of it because of one teacher. One man that had seen his potential and had given him a chance to prove himself. One man that taught him and provided him with tools to succeed. He wouldn't be here without him. He wouldn't have made it this far without him.
