EdNext Podcast · Ep. 124 – May 16, 2018: The Trouble with Ranking Teacher-Prep Programs
For a brief period, states were required to rank their teacher education programs based in part on how much their graduates were boosting student test scores.
But when Paul von Hippel and Laura Bellows took a close look at the evaluations of teacher education programs in six states, they found that the differences between the programs in their graduates’ impact on student learning were negligible.
Paul von Hippel joins Marty West to discuss his study, “Rating Teacher-Preparation Programs: Can value-added make useful distinctions?,” co-authored with Laura Bellows.
The EdNext Podcast is available on Apple Podcasts, Google Play, Soundcloud, Stitcher and here every Wednesday.
