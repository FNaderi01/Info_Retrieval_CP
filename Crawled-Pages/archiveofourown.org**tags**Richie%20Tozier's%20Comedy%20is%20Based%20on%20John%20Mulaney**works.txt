    Summary
      "I'll help you swim" was all Richie said before grabbing Eddie's hand and jumping down into the deep waters below. Those four words had stuck with Eddie for decades. "I'll help you swim."Eddie hadn't seen Richie -or any of the other losers- since that summer, but he thought about them constantly.  He expected they all were probably off living their best lives, meanwhile, he was trapped in his dead-end job, married to a woman who he barely knew. When Eddie stumbles upon one of Richie's comedy specials, The Losers Club has to reassemble yet again, leading them to the sewers of Derry, Maine to finally end IT once and for all.

    Summary
      "i'm gay, and it's been a long road to get here."he laughed nervously, and then took a deep breath."i think i first knew when i saw one mister leonardo dicaprio in titanic for the first time," he got a cheer for that. "i know, right? leo, baby, if you see this, give me a call," he winked dramatically at the audience, waving and blowing a kiss to the cameras that were set up to give netflix a rough draft for a possible special. "but i think what solidified it was when i saw my childhood best friend for the first time in 27 years a few months back, and my first thought was, 'huh, i guess i can't make jokes about fucking your mom anymore. she was never nearly as pretty as you are.'' he laughed, adjusting his glasses before continuing. "but then again, i carved our initials into a shitty wooden bridge in my hometown when i was like thirteen, so maybe i knew i was in love with him before then."orrichie comes out onstage during his first original show.

      “Whoa!” Richie said as he sat down in the plush chair, taking his seat next to the desk on his left. “This set is so much smaller than I ever imaged it,”
“Aww, you imagined my set?” The host, Jennifer Frendei, laughed, preparing herself for the next segment of her show. Rich leaned back, quickly getting comfortable in his spot. He nodded, pointing to his right where there were a few extra chairs.
“Yeah, I had a wet dream that took place right there,” he said, before winking at the camera.
