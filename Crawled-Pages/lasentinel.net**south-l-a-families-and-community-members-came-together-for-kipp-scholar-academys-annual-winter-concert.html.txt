South L.A. families and community members came together for KIPP Scholar Academy’s Annual Winter Concert            
				By Sentinel News Service                
	                	                Published January 24, 2019
On Friday January 11, 2019, KIPP Scholar Academy in South L.A., hosted its Annual Winter Concert, featuring performances from diverse, local middle school students. Attendees enjoyed lively performances from the school drumline, STEP team, the Street Poets (Slam Poetry) groups, the after-school program cheer team and the sign language club.

Students also had the opportunity to interact with and perform alongside Yvette Cooke, the current lead singer of Rose Royce, of the hit song Car Wash fame.
The event was well received by students. “I was excited for the winter concert because we all get to come together like a family and sing along together,” said a middle school student.
Many families and local community members came together to show support for the students who have been practicing and preparing all semester long. All proceeds from the event went to KSA’s music department.
This year KIPP LA Public Schools received NAMM’s 2018 Best Communities for Music Education award for its outstanding commitment to music education. The award is designated to districts that demonstrate outstanding achievement in efforts to provide music access and education to all students.
