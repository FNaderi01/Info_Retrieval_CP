History[edit]
Established on December 29, 1967, its classes officially started on September 2, 1969.[1] For the 2008–2009 academic year, Seward County Community College merged with Southwest Technical School to become Seward County Community College/Area Technical School.[2] The name changed again in 2016 when the institution once again became Seward County Community College. The college retained the technical school programs and facilities as an academic division of the larger organization.
Academics[edit]
Seward County Community College academics are currently divided into five academic divisions: Allied Health; Industrial Technology; Agriculture, Business &amp; Personal Services; Humanities and Social Sciences; and Science, Math and PE.[3] The academic divisions collectively offer 40 majors. The Allied Health division provides programs in nursing, surgical technology, lab technology and respiratory therapy, which is a major supply point for medical personnel in the area.
