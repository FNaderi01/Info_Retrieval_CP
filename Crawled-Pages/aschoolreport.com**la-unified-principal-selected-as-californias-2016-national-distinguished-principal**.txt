Marcia S. Reed, principal of 186th Street Elementary School in Gardena, was selected as California’s 2016 National Distinguished Principal.
“Reed was nominated and selected by her fellow principals through a statewide search process conducted by the Association of California School Administrators,” said Elementary Principal Representative Ron Tanimura.
The National Association of Elementary School Principals established the program in 1984 to celebrate elementary and middle-level principals, who set high standards for instruction, student achievement, character and climate for their learning communities.
“At the helm of every successful school is a successful principal,” said Gail Connelly, executive director of the elementary school principals group. “Our National Distinguished Principals program provides us with an opportunity to recognize the outstanding leadership of these principals and their commitment to creating successful learning communities. Because of them, students thrive academically, teachers grow professionally, and communities are strengthened.”
