      Notes:
      This is mostly a series about Rey having a not entirely antagonistic relationship with her adoptive grandfather. All parts are probably canon divergent to canon non-compliant, but there are also modern AU parts, and, for lack of a better place to put it, I'm shoving a different but vaguely similar AU in Primary sequence:"...so are pomegranate molasses, oobleck, and engine oil (dawn on your ancestral lands)" - Rey Skywalker discusses relationships, Jedi principles, and the nature of evil with the Force ghost of her grandfather.hopefully soon to come: "...so is seedy blackberry jam (pour birch beer on your wounds)" - prequel, Rey's father is adopted; how Rey's biological parents became entangled with him, and how he ended up on Jakku.Modern AU:hopefully soon to come:"...so is cherry blossom pink nail polish (at each end of the saber, we're the same)" - Rey hangs up her saber at the end of the war and starts to learn how to make things that fly, with her grandfather now a presence in her life.AUs set in the GFFA:(w/o adoption) "...so is pizza sauce (come to the dark side, the emperor's why we still have pizza!)" -  Rey finds out about their kinship in a rather different environment and is involuntarily volunteered to help make a pizzeria commercial.

    Creator Chose Not To Use Archive Warnings No Archive Warnings ApplySheev Palpatine &amp; ReyRey (Star Wars) Sheev Palpatine | Darth SidiousAlternate Universe - Canon Divergence not necessarily canon compliant fix-it for the whole grandmother issue also Rey kinda remains a nobody ALTHOUGH Rey Palpatine look Palpatine family angst is part of my brand also Rey Skywalker refounding the Jedi Order with an ear to curated Darth Bane Id Fic Family angst as in angst over what it means to be family but also abusive familial relationships Cosinga can go to hell Sidious isn't the whole truth and nothing but the truth about Palpatine i.e. Palpatine being genial arguably manipulative and actually having a point ok to podfic
    Summary
  on [badly] chosen families, connections, manipulation, and the refounding of the Jedi Order by the granddaughter of a Sith with the echoes of Bane, curated, in her ears
Rey Skywalker gets a visit from her ghost grandfather. It goes, strangely, relatively well.
