    Chapter Text
    Human Owl House AU17 YearsHuman! Amity Blight x Neko! Luz NocedaFluff all around!Cat Puns.She never saw this coming.
Grudgby was the name of the sport, Amity was the name of the captain and star player of the team, lots of people - both guys and girls - were into her, whether it was for her looks, lineage, status, grades, or the fact that she is the richest girl in the whole city - she didn't care, so far her only love was for sport, grades, her friend circle, her teammates, and her siblings - who were undoubtedly the most mischievous, trouble makers in the entire school district.Amity is very popular at school for who she is, but she's also one of the most feared students - however nice she may seem, she was in fact quite mean, a bully - her parents pretty much made her that way.When school was over for the day and Amity was heading for her car to go home she was stopped by the sound of barking and hissing from nearby, so she went to investigate.Moving quietly through the trees and bushes that lined the school's parking lot - Amity came upon a sight she'd never seen before in her entire seventeen years of living.Three big black dogs standing over a munchkin sized cat with long, matted brown fur - so cute and helpless, she had to do something!So she reached into her pocket and clasped her fingers around her pocket-knife, then she reached down and grabbed a club-like stick - which she then hurled at the dogs, catching one of them on the head and sending two of them running, the final dog stood its ground - she pulled out her pocket-knife and slashed at the dog, nicking it on the bridge of its nose and then it hurled itself after the first two.The wee little kitty was shaking in its furry boots out of pure terror, and with gentle hands she scooped up the little cat and carried it to the car, then she drove to the vet.After the trip to the vet the little kitty looked a lot better, the crust under its eyes and nose was gone, it was free of fleas and ticks, had its shots and vaccinations, the extra fur having been cut away to reveal the adorable little love-bug underneath. "I'll call you Luzura, after my favorite book character." Amity smiled, a genuine smile.She had bought two pet bowls - one for water and one for food, a cozy pet bed, toys, treats, and a plush fish scented catnip, including an adjustable violet purple collar with a gold colored tag.After a month of letting 'Luzura' settle in and Amity's parents finding out, it was time for 'bring your pet to school day', to which any kids with pet allergies stayed home.Boscha showed off her cute doggo with pale fur, it was even wearing glasses. "Its funny because dogs don't wear glasses." She chuckled, holding the shaking animal close. "Her name is Flower, she was abused by her previous owners - I might have stolen her but she's far safer with me." Then Jerbo showed them his mini-dog Barcus - who was also wearing glasses and a purple shirt. "This is Barcus." Was all he said.Finally it was Amity's turn. "Alright, so I'm gonna need all of mew to seriously calm down, she's purr-y sensitive and if someone so much as hurts her then I will tear them apart." She said, glaring - the others began to whisper. "Did she just make cat puns?"Then she carefully reached into a carrier that was behind her and gently picked up the contents, she proceeded to place it's contents on her lap - a short furred but fluffy brown cat, only a bit bigger than an adult munchkin - in its mouth was the mini fish plush. "Guys, meet Luzura, I rescued her a little over a month ago - she was in a small area of trees and bushes off the side of the parking lot, and was being attacked by some dogs. I love her a lot, I guess you could say she's the cats' meow." To which she promptly burst out into a fit of giggles alongside Boscha.After placing all the pets down in a makeshift playpen the students began to eat lunch - Amity kept a watchful eye on Luzura and the dogs, apparently she was the only one with a cat in her class.Barcus had a book under his paws and it looked like he was reading, Flower was watching the other two while Luzura played with her toy fish.The teachers entered the room - Eda Clawthorne and her sister Lilith Clawthorne, Eda had brought her pets with her - she had lived as a feral person in her late teens and her only companions were a below average sized wolf named King and a little brown owl named Owlbert.King kept far away from the smaller creatures because he was unsure of them, Owlbert on the other hand was hopping around Barcus - both Flower and Luzura had opted to move to the corner and away from the owl as well as the sight of the wolf.Amity blessed the heavens when the day finally came to an end - picking up the clearly shook munchkin and placing her back into the carrier, and headed home.
   About two months later something weird happened. 
Boscha was going away for summer break and couldn't bring Flower with her, so she left her in the hands of Amity because she knows how capable the youngest Blight is when it comes to pets.The Blight girl was minding her own business as she walked down the hallway - looking for Flower and Luzura but not having any luck finding them.As Amity was walking down the empty hallway that once housed her brother and sister - they had moved out a month ago to live free of their parents - she heard voices. "No, I think she's starting to become suspicious of our behaviour." Someone whispered, but she was unable to hear the name that was said. "I get that much, but what about yours? Have you told her yet?" Replied a second voice."Are you kitten me? What would I say to her? 'Hi I am your cat'? What do you take meow for?" The first voice came again. "It isn't my fault that she's getting suspicious of us, Willow. You're the one that transformed into a five foot three wolf on two legs and then landed a thug in the hospital." The first voice insisted.The closer Amity got to the source of the bickering the more prominent the words became. "How was I supposed to control that? He tried to kidnap her right in front of me!" Protested the second. "That still isn't a good reason to land him very literally in a hospital!" The first one replied.Amity slowly peeked around the door frame of Emira's old bedroom, inside the mostly empty room was a short, chubby, pale skinned girl with dark blue-green hair and glasses - as well as a taller girl with a carmel complexion, brown eyes, and chocolate brown hair - both girls wore similar outfits, the shorter one wore a dark grey and green uniform while the taller one sported the same attire but in purple, the former wore a pink collar while the latter was wearing a purple collar, both collars were uncannily similar to that of Luzura and Flower's own.What really threw Amity off was that both of the strangers had animal ears and tails, the one called Willow had pointy dog ears and a curled tail, the one whose name was not spoken had round tipped cat ears and a fluffy tail. "I like my master, she's kind and caring despite how mean everyone says she is - I don't ever see her be mean to anyone." Said the neko. "That's probably because of you, Luz." Replied Willow. "You bring out the best in everyone, including bullies like your master." Continued the dog-girl.The moment Amity heard the name of the second girl it hit her like a brick - Luzura is a neko. How did that even happen? Was she always like that - a neko? Slowly she stepped inside. "Flower? Luzura?" She called - pretending she hadn't heard their conversation. "Good gravy! Hurry! We gotta transform back!" Luz whisper-yelled to Willow. "We can't! Not until tomorrow!" Willow replied - the two of them backing away and into a corner.Unfortunately Amity found exactly where they went. "What the literal fluff happened to you two?" She asked, crossing her arms, looking the two animal girls up and down. "I-I-I can explain!" Luz said, waving her hands frantically. "Alright, explain this then." Amity gestured at the two of them.Luz gulped. "Well, you see... I'm a Neko - a cat girl, I have at least two different forms, my normal form and my cat form, you know me as the cat." She explained, then looked to Willow. "I wouldn't say I'm a werewolf - mostly because I turn into a dog, I'm not exactly sure what I am, aside from being a wolfdog." Willow explained.After taking a few moments to process the information all Amity could do was shrug. "Okay, this is weird and I don't quite understand it - but I don't control what you both turn into. Flower- I mean Willow, if you haven't told Boscha about this you need to tell her when she gets back, as for you Luz - I honestly don't know how to feel about this." She said, spreading her hands wide apart to show how hard the situation is to comprehend for her.Things were a little awkward between the three of them for a couple of days - but Amity eventually got over the fact that her pet is an actual person, well... It's hard to explain really.What Amity didn't expect was that she'd started to fall in love with Luz - it started out as a soft fluttering of wings in her stomach whenever she thought of the cat girl, then her face would become flushed whenever she spoke to Luz or if she heard her purring, and by the time that another month had passed by during this development Amity's heart would hammer against her ribcage rapidly at any interaction she had with Luz.She obviously spent time with Willow so as to not neglect the poor girl, but whenever she was alone she would just doodle aimlessly in her notebook - usually she ended up drawing something of Luz, and hearts - lots of hearts.One late afternoon was an occasion unknown to her, Luz led her outside to a cliff overlooking the sea far below - as the sun was setting over the ocean, casting a beautiful array of colors across the sky - ranging from pink, orange, gold, and faded blue.Luz turned around to look at Amity, an unreadable expression on her face - her ears twitching slightly. "Amity, there's something I've been meaning to tell you for a while..." The brunette began, taking Amity's hands in her own and leaning toward her, feeling the humans' breath caress her neck. "W-What would that be?" Amity asked, biting her lip. "I love you so much..." Those five words hit the teenage girl like a truck - Luz loves her and honestly she couldn't be happier, she was high up and over the moon! "I love you too..." Amity whispered, and then Luz kissed her.She was finally happy, not only had she made two new friends in the past month, but she finally found someone to love and cherish, to call more than her equal - to call her her girlfriend.
  I hope you enjoyed this chapter!
  I love cats, this was filled with fluff, cat puns, and a fluffy cat.
  It's so cute it could make someone sick. XD
  This chapter goes out to 'Bigtime12'.
  Stay tuned!
        Notes:
