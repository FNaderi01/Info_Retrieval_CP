    Summary
      After Steve is informed of Joe White's death, he and Danny take a trip to Virginia, and once on the mainland head to the crime scene where they face off with two Federal Agencies, the BAU and NCIS neither of which are willing to back down. After Danny talks some sense, the 6 men come to the conclusion, for the victim's sake, that the two agencies plus the 5-0  task force will be working the case together, which leads to another problem.Who is going to take the lead?
