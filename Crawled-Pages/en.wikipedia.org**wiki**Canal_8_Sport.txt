CANAL8 Sport was a Danish television channel owned by TV4 Group and C More Entertainment.
The channel was announced on July 3, 2012. The channel replaced Canal+ Sport 1 in Denmark.[1]
The reason for this is that after Canal+ lost the rights to the Premier League in 2010, they have a hard time keeping the subscribers in Denmark to their premium sports package.
And thus it was decided to move the most popular sport with Danish viewer interest from a high pay channel to an advertising financing low pay channel. the channel is first of all a football channel and show matches from Danish Superliga, UEFA Europa League, La Liga, Serie A and Eredivisie and other sports like UFC fighting, ATP Tennis, Indycar Racing and Swedish Hockey League.
Following this decision, the C More Sports package was not made available in Denmark.
An HD version of Canal 8 Sport was launched on June 3, 2013.
In the Summer of 2015, Discovery Networks Northern Europe purchase the channel, and on July 1, 2015 it merged with Eurosport 2 into a new sportschannel called Eurosport DK.
