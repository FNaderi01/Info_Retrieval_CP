                            kalendraashtar:Fanfiction - Magnificent StrangersThere are places where you half-expect to meet the man of your
dreams: a dim nightclub, while you dance around each other in a sweaty
courtship; a Christmas party, showered with copious amounts of expensive booze;
a holiday at an adults-only resort in Barbados, crawling with other
slightly desperate single people; a trendy pub after work hours, eyes clashing
from different corners of the room.And then there are places where youâ€™d never expect to meet anyone
significant, much less the love of your life. The crowded and solemn wake of a relative, who happens to be a
prominent figure in the community. A dentist appointment bound to leave you
with two less wisdom teeth and a swollen face for three days. A midnight impromptu
trip to a convenience store to grab sanitary towels, because your period
arrived unexpectedly, when you didnâ€™t even bother to put on actual clothes
underneath your trench coat. Â Or a chemotherapy session, in the middle of your third treatment
cycle.Coming soonFirst chapter coming soon after Christmas. ðŸŽ€
