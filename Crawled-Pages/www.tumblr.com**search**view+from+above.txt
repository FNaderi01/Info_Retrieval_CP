digitaldiscipline  asked:What is your favorite animal tidbit about the denizens of Lake Baikal?actually my favorite thing about Baikal is the lake itself!viewed from above, it looks like nothing particularly special. sure, it’s a big lake, but it doesn’t have the surface area of the Great Lakes or the Caspian Sea, right?WRONG!BOOM.see, Lake Baikal really isn’t a lake at all, it’s a deep rent in the earth’s crust called a Rift Valley that just happened to get water in it. and the Baikal rift is one of the deepest and narrowest on earth, making this deceptively placid lake slightly over a MILE deep! that’s bonkers nutso.like, you think the OCEAN is bad, just imagine being in a little fishing boat on this thing without realizing just how far away the bottom is….
