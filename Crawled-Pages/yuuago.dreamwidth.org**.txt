Duolingo - New voices in Norwegian courseOct. 10th, 2020 09:44 am
Aha, Duolingo has added two new voices into its system for the Norwegian course!I have the audio comprehension lessons turned off, but I still get the text read out to me by the robot voices on many of the lessons. The new voices sound so much more natural. Still obviously not real people, but the pronounciation is better, and the flow sounds more like actual Norwegian.People were commenting on that flow, and I find the reactions/surprise to it kind of funny. Obviously, real people don't talk quite exactly like that, but... Yes, that's close to how it is. I've heard Norwegian language described as sounding "sprightly", and I think that's a good word for it. It's springy, kind of bouncy, and the effect can make it sound oddly cheerful even when the subject isn't, or like someone's asking a question even when they aren't. It's one of the things that I like about the way it sounds (and one of the things in speech that I'd never be able to do myself if I actually tried speaking it).Anyway, it's almost enough for me to turn on the audio comprehensions. Not quite, though. ;) But it is a reminder that I should seek out more audio-centric sources, because my current listening abilities are uh, not good.

☆ Brrr, it's starting to get cold! Stepped outside to go for a run this evening, and I had to go right back inside and get my gloves. Awful.☆ Thanksgiving this weekend. I really would rather not, but y'know. It is how it is. Let's get this over with! ☆ Yesterday, was reading through a draft that I'd set aside for a while. Found myself thinking, "You know, this is actually pretty good". Which is a relief, because when I finished writing that thing, I hated it! Looks like it's time to work on it again now.☆ Thinking about taking a day off next week. Just a random one in the middle of the work week. I need to get through all of this vacation time somehow. :|a☆ Looks like the Yuletide tagset is visible now. What the heck, I had no idea that Promare is still eligible! Looks like there are lots of other neat things in the list, too. Are any of you thinking of participating? I'm going to have to sit it out, but if I get all of these auction fics done early, then treating maybe....

Nonbinary pronouns in NorwegianOct. 7th, 2020 08:15 pm
I recently had a conversation with a Norwegian acquaintance about nonbinary pronouns in Norwegian language. Thought I'd drop some notes here so I won't forget the details.The person I spoke with said that there isn't really a consensus on an equivalent to singular "they", but there are a few options:De/dem - Same as plural de/dem, so literally the same as singular they/them in English.Hen/hens - Borrowed from proposed nonbinary pronoun hen in Swedish. Those who've looked for information on gender-neutral pronouns in Scandinavian languages might recognize this one.Hin - Much less frequently used than hen. One of the issues with hin is that it's a word that already exists in Norwegian - its use in nynorsk roughly translates to something like "the other one" - so that might be why it's used rarely.So... Now I know the options, if I ever want to write something in Norwegian about a nonbinary person! I suppose. Though of course if I were referring to someone who has a preference for one or the other, obviously I'd go with whatever that is.--Of course, I only spoke about it with one person, and Norwegian language being as it is, someone in a different part of the country might have given me a somewhat different answer. With that in mind, if anyone who knows anything about this subject sees this and has input, I'd be interested in hearing it.

Someone was a douche to me today. Feeling cranky about it.I'm just going to let that feeling sit for a while, and then go for a walk. Because I can't just... stop... feeling a thing, but it isn't productive to dwell on it, so I might as well just let it be for a while, and then do something else.

Various things from the past week:+ Went for a two-hour walk/run last evening. Very refreshing! This morning I was so tired and sore that I really didn't want to get out of bed, haaa. (I'm fine though. Just have a few minor regrets. xD)+ Received notice that my living room furniture won't be in until mid-November; I was originally told mid-October. Not a big deal, but it would be nice to have somewhere more comfortable to read than the kitchen table.+ Made an attempt at Cooking An Elaborate Thing. It did not turn out quite right, but it was edible so whatever. Upside, it did give me some ideas for a more basic dish that uses similar ingredients in a less fussy way, and that will hopefully turn out better. :)b+ My neighbour has a very cute dog! I saw it twice this past week. :D+ My mom discovered a bunch more of my books in the basement. This necessitated buying another book case so that I'd have space to put them all. Whoops. At least I had the space for it. Now it's set up, and everything's on the shelves, and none of the shelves on the other cases are double-stacked, so what you see is what you get. Some of those books are probably going to go over to the Little Library once it opens again - but in the meantime they have a place.+ I got my hair cut! Haven't had it cut since... last November? And it was driving me absolutely insane. Taking hours and hours to dry, too. No bueno. It looks SO much better, and the stylist didn't make a fuss about me wanting to take several inches off, which is a big plus. (I absolutely hate that "Are you SURE?" conversation. It's probably because they've had people get it chopped and then regret it, but... I don't mind. It's just hair, it'll grow back.) My head feels so light now. xD Must admit, it's always flattering, the way stylists gush over the colour - "People pay hundreds of dollars to have hair like this, you know!" Haaa.+ I have lots of vacation time left! The pandemic had thrown a wrench into everything travel-related! So no Victoria for me this year, but I'm hoping to take some days off in the next month or two... depending on how things go with work. We're kind of slammed right now, and I don't want to check out when it's busy. Going to have to see what the estimated schedule is. :|a (Though, of course, things never ACTUALLY go according to schedule. And you never know when some part of the plant is going to fail and then need emergency maintenance, directing mountains of paperwork toward me.)+ People are already starting to talk about Christmas shopping and what are you getting so-and-so and do you have a list yet and blah blah blah. Aughh! ...Then again, it's necessary, considering that everything needs to be ordered in and it can take a while even under normal circumstances. Still, I don't want to be thinking about winter yet!So, that's about it. I hope you all had a wonderful weekend.

Really glad for that gym in this complex. SO glad. It's dark by 7:30 now, not really optimum for jogging. But at least I have options.I've felt like absolute crap all day - some really unpleasant, awful thoughts. I don't like the person I was in my head today. But after a nice workout, I feel so much better. Less... angry and hateful (toward both the world in general and myself).40 minutes today. Planning to work up to 60 eventually. Might take a while though - the elliptical takes a lot out of me. Maybe I could do 20 min elliptical and 40 min bike, in the beginning? Hmmm....Ugh, I really need to jump in the shower. Immediately. I'm so sweaty, it's absolutely disgusting. xD (But I feel great.)

Continuing to call myself a poetSep. 23rd, 2020 09:45 pm
Just sent in a submission to a literary magazine. [/breathes into a paper bag]I don't even know why I feel so nervous about it. Like, I don't necessarily feel a big drive to be published. But getting accepted would be pretty cool - mostly for the "I tried a thing and succeeded at it" factor, I think.Well. We'll see. If this one doesn't go through, I can keep trying. (And if enough poems are rejected, I could make a collection of the rejected works! Hah!)

A nice runSep. 23rd, 2020 08:13 pm
Went for a run this evening. Felt really good.There's this bit near here that's full of little inclines. Nice. Some of them are pretty steep. Decided to run up a pretty sharp bit while listening to "Kakusei" and oof, that was tough.Goal: Run all those inclines without getting winded. Yeah.Need to start doing yoga on a regular basis again. Tried it the other day and I was so unimpressed with myself. If you stop doing it a while, you go back to 0 pretty damn quickly.I've gone to the gym in my complex a couple times. It's usually deadsville in the evening, so I have the place to myself. It's mostly cardio, but they have a few free weights. Kind of tempted to start working on that, but I'm going to need to do some research first.I'm dreading winter. Fuck. No more light. No more running. Walking, maybe, a little, for a while, but it'll get slippery eventually. But IN THE MEANTIME... I have lots of things I can work on.

Na na na na na na na na na na BATMANSep. 20th, 2020 11:52 am
I never really thought of myself as a Batman fan, but it turns out that I have four different Batman movies on my shelf, so... even though I've never read any of the comics, I guess I at least have certain thoughts on Batman films.The films: Batman: The Movie (1966, with Adam West as Batman), Batman (1989, with Michael Keaton), Batman Begins (2005, with Christian Bale), and The Dark Knight (2008, with Christian Bale, sequel to Batman Begins).I feel like the '89 and '08 Batman films are remembered more for their Jokers than for the title characters. At least, I've seen people talking about Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger in those roles, but not much discussion about Batman-the-character (aside from mentions that Christian Bale was not that great).For me, the ultimate Batman movie is '66. Adam West is my Batman.When I was a kid, my babysitter had the '66 movie on VHS, and I watched and watched and watched it a ton of times. And when I found it on DVD in the Superstore discount bin a few years ago, I couldn't resist. Watched it, and it still holds up - if what you're looking for is silly cheesy fun.The plot of '66 is bonkers, and there's lots of BAM and POW and it's just so bright and delightful.The other films are all right, but... they're so dark! And I know that Batman tends to have a dark, kind of broody association. But what I look for in Batman is something fun and wacky. And that's probably nostalgia talking, I know, but I guess my tastes were solidified very early on, as far as this stuff goes.

Okay thenSep. 17th, 2020 10:06 pm
Heard some wacko yelling and banging on the door to my building. He kept at it for quite a while, too. Had intended to go out for a long walk this evening, but uh... yeah, no. Man, this is something I don't miss about living in apartment buildings near major transit stations. Though it's still nothing like when I was living in Saskatoon, so there is that.I hate that it's getting so dark out at such an early hour. I don't mind going around in the dark in general, but people who are not me can be a problem. (Also, cars.)Luckily for me, my building has a gym, and it tends to be deadsville in the evenings. Totally not as nice as going for a good long walk, though.Or maybe I should start doing this stuff after work instead? Going to have to think about how to juggle that kind of scheduling. I suppose it depends on what I'm planning for supper. Man, is that ever going to be a pain in the ass. Definitely going to put more effort into learning how to cook simple, healthy, fast meals...I've accepted the fact that my eating is disordered. I say "my eating is disordered" because it's not like I've been diagnosed with anything, and I haven't sought that out, so what the hell do I know. But I do realize that my relationship with food is incredibly fucked for various reasons that I'd rather not get into. But it is a problem, and I fully intend to work on fixing this problem.So! Yes. Learning how to cook, having a healthy balanced diet, and getting on an even keel with this is definitely a goal. Hopefully at some point I'll stop resenting the entire concept of eating.

Moved in!Sep. 15th, 2020 09:25 pm
I'm in my apartment. Hooray!The movers were supposed to come at 9, but didn't get to my house until 2PM. Lovely. HOWEVER, it's fine. All my stuff is set up (though with all the boxes around, it's a little disorganized). Things are in roughly the place that they're supposed to be. I don't have living room furniture, but my dad did put my kitchen table together.And obviously, I have internet. Very important. ;) Setting it up myself was kind of a pain in the ass, but at least it's done.Now... to sleep! In my new bed! YAY.

Kpop nostalgiaSep. 12th, 2020 09:18 am
The other day I ended up listening to Love Story by G.O.D/Groove Over Dose. In the span of a couple seconds, I was instantly transported back to 2006, when I near-constantly playing their Chapter 5: Letter album on repeat. It's like I got smacked upside the head with a load of nostalgia.I still have that album. When I was packing up my stuff, I came across the box where I'd stored it. A lot of my stuff from that era has been in the basement for years, never unpacked after my last move, and I haven't had a chance to listen to it for ages.Never was super into Kpop (Jrock was more my style), but I did like G.O.D a lot. Also H.O.T too (I still really, really love their song Candy, it's so bouncy and fun). Looks like G.O.D released some new material last year, which is a pleasant surprise. I'll have to check it out when I finished moving.It's kind of crazy to think of now vs back then - like, the only stuff I knew about was what I heard of through the two people I knew who were into it, and youtube wasn't on my radar because it was very new - I was still finding music by looking up artists my friends mentioned on Kazaa and downloading things at random. And the only way I ended up with an actual CD was because one of the aforementioned people sent it to me from the USA.But now, it's so easy to just... listen to this stuff, and purchase it legally instead of buying it from some sketchy person on Ebay or getting a friend to burn it for you. Even my local library has some Kpop stuff. Well, sure, they don't have anything by the two groups that I like, but they have some work by girl groups that I've heard of but haven't listened to before. And one BTS album. The fact that there's anything at all is blowing my mind....Anyway. I'm looking forward to listening to G.O.D's Chapter 5 album on repeat in a few days, while I unpack.

Moving... soon!Sep. 10th, 2020 07:24 pm
Man, if I never hear someone say "You need to-" again, it'll be too soon. I'm so sick of people telling me what to do! Especially when I know that these are things I need to do! And I have plans to do them, and have plotted out when and how, it's just that I haven't told those plans to anyone else, because they're not the one who needs to do these things!Yes, yes, I need to finish packing, and I need to buy groceries (and a coffee maker), and I need to make a decision about which living room furniture to order. This isn't rocket science!On a positive note: The painter finished my apartment, and it looks great. Damn, I wish I knew somebody in the area who's looking to get their walls painted, because I'd recommend this guy without question. Anyway, the new walls are a very clean sky blue colour, with crisp white trim. Much better than the coffee-coloured walls that were there before. Dude, why. And in a north-facing apartment? At this latitude? Double why!The movers are coming for my bedroom furniture + boxes and bins on the 15th! I'm moving in on that day! I'm also theoretically getting my internet installed that day. Except, uh, I... have to do it myself? Like, the Shaw guy comes around with a kit, and then I set it up on my own. I don't know. Something tells me there is a chance that this is a Project that will not be finished on the afternoon of the 15th. At least, if my effort to install my mom's cable box is any indication. (Yes, yes, DIY internet installation != DIY cable box setup. And to be fair it actually turned out that there was something wrong with that cable box, which is why nothing worked when I tried to set it up. But, still. It's fiddling around with unfamiliar electronic equipment and ugh I don't wanna.)I'm too busy to get excited about all this. I'll have time to get excited about it when everything is done!

Stuff accomplished over the last few days:+ Went on some very long walks+ Took a few boxes of stuff over to my apartment+ Packed up a few other boxes+ Handed over my apartment keys to the painters so they can do their work+ Various chores etc+ Finished reading The Law of Lines by Hye-Young Pyun. Good novel! Check it out if you like thrillers/mysteries. (Though I will note that the mystery doesn't exactly get solved in the end. In some ways it's more of a drama, I guess.)+ Ran all over downtown, accomplishing nothing. See, I'm going to need to buy some living room furniture, but two of the places that sell this stuff are closed because they aren't finished rebuilding from the flood, and the place that's still open doesn't really have anything for their floor stock. Now I'm back to square one, and will probably have to order something sight-unseen. Bummer. :V+ Worked on some FTH stuff. Now that my fic for iddyiddybangbang is complete, I'm going to direct 100% of my creative energy to the auction fics I owe. ;VOverall, I did manage to do more than I expected, and actually got to relax a bit, surprisingly. But I'm going to be very happy when all of this moving stuff is over with. Still need to call the cable company to arrange to get internet installed... sigh.

[Movies] Mulan 2020Sep. 6th, 2020 09:27 pm
Gathered together online with some friends to watch the live-action adaptation of Disney's Mulan this evening.Overall, I found it kind of bland and disappointing. Somewhat "extruded wuxia product", if you know what I mean.However, I can definitely see where the femslashers are coming from re: shipping Mulan/Xian Lang (the witch). Hoo boy. The canon-divergent AUs practically write themselves. ...I wonder if there's any fanart or fic out there.Overall, I find it hard to judge this movie. I liked the original a lot, and the equivalent scenes in this version didn't have as much emotional impact as the animated version - but would I feel that way if I weren't so attached to the original? Who knows!It does make me want to track down some of the Chinese film adaptations of the Mulan story. I've heard some of them are pretty good, but haven't seen any myself yet.
