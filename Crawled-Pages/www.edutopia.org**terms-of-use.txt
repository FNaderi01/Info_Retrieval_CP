By accessing, viewing, downloading, or otherwise using content, media, or any other products or services, including the underlying proprietary code and technology, owned or operated by the George Lucas Educational Foundation or its affiliates, subsidiaries, related corporate entities, and authorized partners ("Edutopia" or "we," "us," or "our") through its website, email products or services, or mobile applications (collectively, the "Edutopia Technologies"), you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the Terms of Use (the "Terms") described below and that your use of such Edutopia Technologies is at all times subject to these Terms. In some cases, the Edutopia content, media, or other products and services (collectively, "Edutopia Resources") may be integrated into websites and mobile applications provided by third parties (including social networking sites), and these Terms also apply to your use of Edutopia Resources.
Additionally, by accessing any of the Edutopia Technologies, you represent that you are at least 13 years old and that you are fully able and competent to enter into and comply with these Terms. If you are older than 13 but under the age of consent where you live, then you must get the consent of your parents prior to using the Edutopia Technologies, and if you do use the Edutopia Technologies, you represent to us that you have done so.
Your privacy is important to us. Our Privacy Policy is available at www.edutopia.org/privacy-policy, and we encourage you to carefully review its terms. In addition to the Privacy Policy, you are also subject to any additional posted guidelines, policies, or rules applicable to specific services and features on the Edutopia Technologies, which may be posted by us from time to time (the "Guidelines"), and we encourage you to read such Guidelines. All of these Guidelines are part of these Terms and are hereby incorporated by reference. To the extent that any terms of these Terms conflict with any Guidelines, these Terms shall control.
These Terms, and any future modifications to such Terms, govern your use of the Edutopia Technologies and constitute a legal contract between you and Edutopia.
If you do not agree to these Terms, please immediately discontinue using the Edutopia Technologies. 
1. User-Generated Content
Absent a separate agreement with us, Edutopia does not claim any ownership rights to the content created by its users and shared through the Edutopia Technologies (including on our social media channels), including content in our blogs or forums ("Your Content"). We reserve the right to disable the ability of users to share content through the Edutopia Technologies and we may also have a third party provider, including but not limited to Facebook, provide a forum on the Edutopia Technologies to share Your Content.  After posting Your Content, subject to any rights of third party providers, you continue to retain any ownership rights you have to Your Content and you continue to have the right to use and license Your Content in any way you choose. The Content that you upload to the Edutopia Technologies needs to comply with these Terms.
You hereby grant Edutopia a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicenseable, and transferable right and license to use, reproduce, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly perform, and publicly display Your Content in any and all media formats or channels, whether now known or hereafter devised, including, but not limited to, the Edutopia Technologies (and our social media channels) without payment and without further consent or notice to you. Without limiting the foregoing, you agree that Content you remove may persist for a reasonable amount of time in backup copies.
You hereby agree that we may remove Your Content in our sole and absolute discretion. You hereby agree that if Your Content is removed from the Edutopia Technologies owing to a violation of these Terms, including in response to any DMCA (as defined below) take-down notice or because such Content contains illegal or otherwise objectionable images, Edutopia shall have the right to use and reproduce Your Content in response to any subpoena or other judicial or administrative order; to assist government enforcement agencies or as otherwise required by law; and to protect the rights, property, or safety of Edutopia, any individual, or the general public. If Your Content is removed, lost, altered, damaged, misused, or otherwise irretrievable, you agree to, and hereby do, waive Edutopia from any and all liability.
You are responsible for making sure that you have all rights to Your Content, including the rights necessary for you to grant the foregoing licenses to Your Content. You are solely responsible for Your Content. Edutopia does not guarantee any confidentiality or privacy with respect to any of Your Content.
Additionally, you understand and agree that Your Content that is displayed on the Edutopia Technologies may continue to appear on the Edutopia Technologies even after your account is deactivated for any reason, as portions of Your Content may have been incorporated into other Edutopia features, including, but not limited to, profiles, community boards, third-party social-sharing sites, RSS feeds, and other features.
2. Submissions
We encourage our users to submit suggestions and ideas to us on a nonconfidential basis. If you send us creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, concepts, or other submissions (e.g., postings to chats, surveys, message boards, contests, or similar items) (collectively, the "Submissions"), you automatically grant, or warrant that the owner of such material expressly grants, Edutopia the royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, and distribute such Submission (in whole or in part) through the Edutopia Technologies and/or to incorporate it in Edutopia Resources or other works in any form, media, or technology now known or hereafter developed for any purpose that Edutopia chooses. Edutopia does not claim any ownership rights to the Submissions. Edutopia is not obligated to integrate any Submission into the Edutopia Technologies or Edutopia Resources but may choose to do so at Edutopia's sole discretion. Regardless of whether or not a Submission is integrated into the Edutopia Technologies or Edutopia Resources, Edutopia is not obligated to maintain any Submissions in confidence and may publicly disclose or use the Submissions. The sender acknowledges that any such use by Edutopia will be without any compensation to the sender whatsoever and may not credit the sender, depending on the form of the Submission. The sender waives all so-called "moral rights" in all Submissions. The sender further waives the right to make any claims against Edutopia relating to unsolicited Submissions.
From time to time, Edutopia may give you opportunities to participate in Edutopia-sponsored events, promotions, and presentations through requests for user Submissions that we may request through our website, social media channels or otherwise. Edutopia will post guidelines (or provide forms) on the Edutopia Technologies regarding your Submission. These guidelines are designed to assist you in providing Edutopia with a Submission that suits our needs. Edutopia may, at its discretion, alter or change the guidelines without notice to you. For instance, Edutopia may extend a deadline for Submissions or accept and/or reject Submissions that fall outside the guidelines at its discretion. Requests for user Submissions are not contests, and user Submissions may be evaluated in any manner Edutopia and its affiliates deem appropriate. Edutopia does not guarantee that any Submission you provide will be reviewed or even considered for publication. In some cases, Submissions not chosen in a Submission request may be used on the Edutopia Technologies before, during, or after the close of the Submission request. Such appearance on the Edutopia Technologies is independent of the decision to use your Submission for a particular event, promotion, or presentation.

19. Injunctive Relief, Governing Law, Venue
You acknowledge and agree that a breach or threatened breach of any covenant contained in these Terms would cause irreparable injury, that money damages would be an inadequate remedy, and that Edutopia shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief, without the posting of any bond or other security, to restrain you from such breach or threatened breach. Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing Edutopia from pursuing any and all remedies available to it, including the recovery of money damages from you.
These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with California governing law and applicable provisions of U.S. federal law without regard to conflict of law principles.

You agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts of the Northern District of California for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.
20. General
The failure of Edutopia to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unlawful, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
You may not delegate or transfer your duties and obligations under these Terms or assign these Terms or your Edutopia account, in whole or in part, to anyone. Edutopia may assign any of its rights and obligations under these Terms without notice or consent, including in connection with any merger (including by operation of law), consolidation, reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its related assets or similar transaction.
These Terms, which incorporate the Edutopia Privacy Policy and the Guidelines, constitute the entire agreement between you and Edutopia and govern your use of Edutopia Technologies, superseding any prior agreements (whether written or oral) between you and Edutopia regarding the subject matter hereof. Neither party is relying upon any warranties, representations, assurances, or inducements not expressly set forth in these Terms.
The terms including and includes shall be deemed to be followed by the statement "without limitation," and neither of these terms shall be construed to limit any word or statement it follows to the specific or similar terms or matters immediately following it.
Edutopia may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to these Terms or any of Edutopia's terms and conditions, by email, regular mail, or postings on Edutopia Technologies. Notices not pertaining to any amendments to these Terms or any Guidelines (such as notices relating to technical changes to Edutopia Technologies) are deemed given two (2) days following the initial posting.
