		Fairy tale parody is a genre of fiction which parodies traditional fairy tales. 
The genre was popularized on television by the Fractured Fairy Tales segments on The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show.[1]
The 2001 computer-animated film Shrek brought great popularity to the genre. Parodies soon eclipsed traditional fairy tales. The genre garnered some praise for its more modern views but was also criticized for supplanting the traditional stories.[2]

The Giant's Big Toe by Brock Cole
