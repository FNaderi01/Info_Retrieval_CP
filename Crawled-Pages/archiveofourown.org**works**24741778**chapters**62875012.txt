      Chapter 58: For the Explorers
          Summary:
            AUTHOR'S NOTE
    Chapter Text
    Hey there!Damn. It’s actually all completed.In writing this I've learned way too much about volleyball and watched way too many videos that it’s coming up on my recommended list on YouTube. Some of the videos are really, really cool.Unfortunately, I've turned into a fan of Yūji Nishida. Very talented volleyball player. He gives me some very Ushijima vibes and I honestly wasn’t a fan of it at first. But then like, this guy, he is just so good it’s mind boggling.But I digress. I wasn’t really expecting to write a Haikyuu fic but then like, I did. Just like my previous story I did say I was planning on only writing up to maybe 30 chapters. Apparently, I'm very bad at estimating because uh, this was an entire 58 chapters. Maybe writing short fics isn’t for me.Speaking of other fics – do you like BNHA/MHA? Do you like Shinsou? What about Dabi? Well, I gotchu!BNHA FIC -it’s another OC insert! Reaches up to 101 chapters and it splits into two endings! Isn’t that just great?Lol.No, but really – come give it a shot :D Anyway, do you want to read more stuff? Well, now you can!I’ve already started writing my next fic. Who could it be? Come to Shiratorizawa to find out!It’ll be another OC insert because I can’t write reader inserts for the life of me. It’ll probably be posted in a week or two. Once I post it, I’ll leave a link right here (Come to Shiratorizawa)EDIT: It's finally posted! Anyway. Thank you for continuing to read and for making it this far and most of all giving this fic a chance! I know OC inserts aren’t very popular compared to the other stuff. So y’all are awesome. I really hope you enjoyed reading the fic and learning shitty one liners and facts in the beginning notes. Thank you for the kudos, comments, subs and bookmarks! &lt;3Feel free to Q&amp;A in comments if you have any or you can just DM me. (via insta or discord)Anyway, that’s pretty much it,Lots of love Piggycat &lt;3 roast_pork_be_sizzlingStay safe!-------------------“Never regret your choices.”“Follow and chase your dreams.”“If people don’t approve or say it’s unrealistic then just push harder, prove them wrong.”“Take care of yourself, not just physically but mentally too.”“If you feel like everything is hopeless, don’t give up.”“Realize your own worth.”“Be kind to yourself.”“Hard work and dedication will pay off”“If you are scared of being tossed to the side, never forget…”“There are people who will always love and support you.”“If you ever think your dream is too hard, just remember…”“There is someone out there making crop circles”“Never stop reaching for the stars.”
