    Summary
      Jackson returns home after a month spent in London trying (and failing) to start the next phase of his life there. Knowing now from experience that he’d be a fool to try to make it as a werewolf on his own, he asks Derek to take him in as a beta. Derek agrees on the condition that Jackson will do as he’s told. Jackson hopes that, despite the mess left in the wake of the Kanima, he might be able to repair his life in Beacon Hills. Of course, things haven’t really been going the way Jackson has hoped lately...

    Summary
      "Stiles was away at college when the world went to shit. He was alone, afraid and so very, very confused. But more than anything, he was determined. He just had to get home. Had to find his dad, his pack. Had to make sure they were safe."
When a rapid spreading virus breaks out, turning most of the population into mindless, undead killing machines, Stiles Stilinski has to fight his way back home. Because nothing, not even the freaking zombie apocalypse can stand between him and the people he loves.
