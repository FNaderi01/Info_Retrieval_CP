      Description:
      This fic series happens in a world that is more this of the 1960s TV Show than of the movie, in the way U.N.C.L.E. works as an organization, its relationship to other powers, etc. It's not overly important towards the plot, since not much happens in the U.N.C.L.E. HQ, but if you know the series, you will definitely see references at characters, villains, places. If you only know the movie, it should not be a problem. Illya is just a full time U.N.C.L.E. agent, way less affiliated with the KGB than in the movie. Gaby is still his BAMF partner. And as for Napoleon...

This fic is the direct sequel to Hooked Up and picks up where Hooked Up ended, so I definitely recommend you read that one first :)
