                                                On Borrowed Time: Chapter 7
                                                    Jamie/Claire Modern AU: The story of Claire Beauchamp, a feminist studies scholar and J.A.M.M Fraser, a playwright, spanning over a period of ten years between Cambridge, MA and Edinburgh, Scotland.Thanks to @kalendraashtar and @notevenjokingfic for helping me work out a few things in this chapter. I appreciate everyone for reading, liking, commenting, and/or reblogging. Teaser // Prologue // Chapter 1 // Chapter 2 // Chapter 3 // Chapter 4 // Chapter 5 // Chapter 6 // Christmas FicletSaints and Sinners PubSt. Leonard’s LaneEdinburgh 7 years ago——-The sun is setting as we walk into the Edinburgh evening.The sky, dripping with red, orange, and purple hues.Nature’s canvas enfolding us in a spectacular burst of colors.Mimicking our euphoria.Lightness abounds.Keepers of the soul bearing witness to a timeless devotional ritual.Knowing us long before we knew our names.Orienting the stars for the first moment of encounter.The smell of rain, lingering in the air.The fading sunlight draining the warmth with the last of its rays.The chilly air, swirling around us.Winter is around the corner.Jamie and I walk in companionable silence; our bodies close together, our fingertips brushing, the barest of touches. I see the restless movements of his fingers, tapping against his thigh, uncertain on whether to surrender to the desire to take my hand into his. We keep stealing glances at each other, sharing flirtatious looks, not bothering to conceal our undeniable attraction and growing affection. We are so aware of us. Eventually, Jamie cocks his head and raises an eyebrow, daring me to break the spell. To make the first move. To say something. Anything. I open my mouth, but nothing materializes. I must have done it more than once. Words hid themselves from my reach, the haze of desire and force of emotions blanketing the sphere of rationality.Not a drop of alcohol has passed through my lips.Yet my bloodstream might as well be saturated with it.For I am drunk on James Fraser. I need to know that I am his. I need to touch him intimately and be touched by him. At 6’ 4” Jamie easily towers over me. Over the general human populace as well. I am never charmed by the sheer physicality of hyper masculinity. On the contrary, I am often repulsed by the race to claim space by asserting male presence and privilege. Jamie takes such a normative (and often toxic) conception, de-constructs, re-assembles and embodies it through the performance of vulnerability, diffusing the threat of his size and as such, displacing masculine ethos. There is gentleness in his strength, compassion in his perspective, gratitude in his privilege, and intelligence in his judgement.Qualities that makes a man worthy of my attention and deserving my trust.I nudge him and tip my head up to speak to him. “Where are we going?”He looks down with a tender smile. “Do ye trust me?”“Yes.”I did not hesitate. I trust him. With my life.“Jamie…”“Change yer mind now?“No. I have a question.”“Aye…?”“I’ve been told that there is a peculiar smell to Edinburgh.”He laughs. “Do ye smell it now?”“A bit. I can say for certain that it involves malt.”His face breaks into a broad grin.  “Aye, yer right. There’s a history ye ken. It’s a mixture of malted barley from the breweries and roasted malt from the distilleries, mixed in with a wee bit of sea smell. Depending on where yer at and the direction of the wind, the smell can be verra strong.”“Oddly enough, I find the smell rather comforting.” I chuckle.“Yer a strange wee Sassenach, aren’t ye?”“Sassenach?” I look at him quizzically.“An English person, a foreigner.”“I can’t argue with that. I suppose I am. Haven’t you heard? Strange is all the rage these days. It doesn’t pay to be normal, that’s for certain. Not that I’ve ever understood the meaning of ‘normal’ or the need for normalcy…”“I like ye strangeness, Sassenach.” His voice is husky.“I like you.”As our gazes’ lock, my heart flutters and my breath hitches. Neither of us care to pretend that we are not lost in each other.—-We end up at Jamie’s favorite pub situated on a quaint lane a few blocks from the University.Saints and Sinners. I am tickled silly by the name. It starts with the giggles. Within seconds it escalates into a fully blown laughter. I am simply unable to contain myself.Girlish giggling. Unrestrained laughter.I have no recent memory of my body producing such a mirthful sound.Pleasure plus bliss plus delight equals mirthful.I take a deep breath to calm myself down. “Saints and Sinners?”He sniggers. “I ken, I ken. Which one are ye, Claire?”I stick my tongue at him.Again, I have no recent memory of engaging such freeing and childish behavior. He shakes his head affectionately, warmth pooling in his eyes, spilling into the wintry night, creating a cocoon around us.“Come, I’ll change ye from an Englishwoman into a Scot.”“You bloody will not! I’ll have you know that I can drin–” He grabs my hand and pulls me into the pub.A wave of welcoming heat, boisterous sounds of conversation and laughter, and the decadent aroma of sustenance greet us. Jamie waves to the bartender and lead us towards a booth tuck away in a corner.Secluded. Cozy.There is a fluttery sensation in my stomach.“Is there anyone you don’t know in Edinburgh?”“You, Sassenach. But I intend to remedy that by the end of the evening.”I let out an inarticulate sound. True to its name, red, black and white are the colors of this intimate Scottish pub with wood-beam ceiling and leather booth seating. There’s even live acoustic Scottish folk music on select days, which Jamie insist I should sample with him on “future dates” (his words) for an “authentic Scottish pub experience.”Sometimes I can’t tell if the bloody man is pulling my leg.If there is one notable aspect to James Fraser it is his lack of desire to impress me. Our first dinner was at an understated place. So is this pub. This is a man in touch with his core. He knows who he is. He is comfortable in his own flesh. He does not need to overpower to make a lasting impression. He is so unlike all the previous men in my life.(I can count the pathetic lot with one hand).All who sought to overwhelm every chance they got.(Flaunting their wealth, family name, and prestige).Falling all over themselves to prove their worth.(Unmemorable, embarrassing and untrustworthy). Every single one of them emotionally stunted. The men.Transients in the day.Shadows in the night.Conscious/subconscious choice.Was it a choice?Resistance in practice.Was it resistance? Whisky seems to be the drink for him, which I enjoy as well. Thanks to Uncle Lamb, I know my liquor and spirits, which clearly impressed Jamie. For a modest pub, Saints and Sinners offers amazing cask ales and various selections of single malts along with a limited but delectable bar food. Between bites of fish pie, veggies, potatoes, and sticky toffee pudding, Jamie and I revisited and deepened parts of our previous dinner conversation interspersed with new topics. Family. Friends. Careers. Playwriting. Teaching. New Haven. Edinburgh. Travels. Hopes. Dreams. Wants. Needs. Quirks. I learn about Edinburgh’s past, present, and future, all through Jamie’s lens of whisky. The man really does have a flair for storytelling.We discuss his performing artist-in-residence program and I convince Jamie to take it, assuring him that I will share pointers on teaching.“This is your life’s work, so shouldn’t it feel good to impart some knowledge to the younger generation?”“Aye but having knowledge is one thing. Sharing it productively is another. Not sure I am the right person for the job.”“Don’t be modest, Fraser. You’ve worked in the major theatre scenes such as New York, Tokyo, Melbourne and have the lived experience that many only dreams of. You have a chance to inspire others through your knowledge and experience. Writing a play and putting it together is one thing but sharing the process of how a play comes to be is a whole other dimension, one that most students rarely get to do, especially with an established playwright such are yourself. The job is written for you.”He blushes furiously. “If ye say so.”“You won’t have trouble with enrollment, of that I am certain. There will be a long line of wom–…I mean students waiting to learn from the Master.”Master? Good God, Beauchamp.This is not an introduction to bondage, discipline, and sadomasochism.“Women? I dinna ken about the women but the Master? What are ye into, Sassenach?” He smirks.“Maybe you’ll find out if you’re a good boy.”The look on his face is worth a king’s ransom. And more. Jamie keeps the whisky flowing. I happily empty my glass. Every single time.“What’s that earlier about turning me from an Englishwoman into a Scot?”“Aye, aye, ye win. Ye drink like a Scot already.” He winks at me.“Jamie, are you winking?” I start giggling.Jamie clearly have no idea how to wink. He ends up blinking solemnly. Like a large red owl.“Are ye laughing at me?” he says sheepishly.In that moment, Jamie Fraser has never been more adorable. I mock his Scottish accent. “Aye, I’m laughing at ye.”I reach for the rest of the pudding and sways into him more forcefully than I think because his arms gently came around to steady me.“Are ye alright lass?”“I can drink you under the table, Fraser.”One corner of Jamie’s mouth twitches, and he regards me with a speculative eye.As the hours passes, the distance between us lessens. His arm, which retreated to a respectful distance after my pudding incident make its way behind me, resting on the booth, his fingertips lightly grazing my shoulder. Whether it’s the late hour, the whisky, his attractiveness, the trust we share, or simple deprivation, I want him. Badly.Not just in the moment of want but in the infinity of wanting. I move in, closing the distance between us, encouraging him and anticipating the next move.The people around us ceases to exist.The boisterous chatter fades away to silence.It is just us, Jamie and Claire, tuck away in a corner booth.Lost in our newfound world where possibilities are endless.Out of the corner of my eye, I see his hands reach for me. Gently removing the glass from my grasp. Taking my hands into his large, warm ones and giving them a light squeeze. My digits are so much smaller than his. He is so careful with me. Sparks igniting in my fingers and toes.I twine my fingers with his. I am transfixed by our hands. They are crafted for each other, a perfect fit. I look up and his head is bent. Studying our hands. His lips brush my fingertips. Softly, like the flutter of a butterfly’s wings.  A moment later, he untangles one hand. Using his index finger, he tips my chin up, our eyes are seeking each other. What I see in his eyes is enough to uplift every second of my waking hours.To sustain me for the rest of my life. For eternity. I’m drowning in him.Lost in the moment.Willing my eyes to communicate what words cannot.He knows. He is secure in that knowledge.His lips ware slightly parted. He licks the bottom lip whilst holding my gaze.“Sassenach…I’d like to kiss ye. May I?”“Yes.”He stares at my lips, runs his thumb over them and leans forward a fraction but pulls away slight to look into my eyes. Seeking consent. Again.“Kiss me.” My voice is a hoarse whisper.“Yer’ so beautiful.” His smiling lips touch mine tentatively. He is soft and warm. Safety. Sanctuary. I want more. So much more. Raking my hands through his hair, I pull him closer and press my lips to his. What starts out as gentle and exploratory quickly escalated into hunger and passion. He cups his hands around my face and begin running the tip of his tongue around my lips. “More” is all I can whisper in the blur of passion that he weaves with skillful lips and silky tongue. He angles his head and dives in. He is feasting on me like a man deprived of nourishment for a long period time. I hear a soft moan and can’t tell if it was his or mine, but in that moment all that matters are our dancing lips and curious tongues, calling upon blessings of all that is divine. We can’t get enough of each other. Our hands are everywhere, unable to stop touching and feeling. Our bodies curve into each other, desperate for more.  Making certain the other is real.That it is us, in this moment, together.This is what it means to be alive. I’ve kissed a fair share of men. Kissing Jamie, though, is a journey to self-discovery, of being intensely aware of myself, of me. Parts of our physical selves have finally found home.(Our souls seemed to have made their way home the moment we met).  I refuse to open my eyes when he breaks away. I tug at the hair on his nape.“Sassenach…Claire…please, we have to stop.”“Why?”“Because we’re in a pub and I’ll…I’ll…”“…you have no good reason, Fraser.”He moans softly as it is my turn to lightly run the tip of my tongue around his lips. He traces my face as if it is the most fragile thing he’s held in his life.“Claire…Claire. We should stop…I canna…didna want to take yer here.” He let out a throaty chuckle.“Is that a threat or a promise?”               He groans. “Ye vixen. We haveta go now. I canna wait…”“You’ll wait. We’ll wait. I’m off to the loo. Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.”As I exit the booth, I purposefully brush my fingertips against the bulge in his pants.He hisses, letting out a string of Gaelic curses under his breath.—-Intent on getting back to Jamie, I fail to pay attention to where I am going until I bump into a hard chest, which almost throws me backwards. “Argh!” I yelp.A vice grip steady me. I look up. The man looks vaguely familiar.“Professor Beauchamp, I am so sorry. Please forgive me! Are you alright?”“Oh, it is my fault, I’m not watching where I am going…err…you are…?”“Allan. Allan Christie. I was in your class the previous semester.”“Yes, yes, of course…the graduate seminar…on Women’s Movement in the Middle East. You wrote a pretty convincing paper on Kuwaiti women during the Gulf War, if I remembered correctly…”“I am flattered you remember my paper.” He removes his arms but remains close to me.“I never forget a good feminist analysis, particularly on a struggle seldom written about. It was also a small seminar, only 12 students so…”“Thank you, Professor. I’ve been meaning to come to your office to discuss an independent study. I’d like to sharpen my analysis in that paper for publication.”“A sound idea. See me after Winter vacation and we’ll go from there. I should be getting back to my err…my booth.” I crane my neck to see Jamie.My fingers itch to touch him again.To trace the shapes of himTo steal the warmth of his breath.To be sheltered by him.Allan follows my line of sight and a strange look came over his eyes, one that quickly disappears as turns his attention back to me. Perhaps I must be imagining his reaction since I am not thinking clearly.Jamie is the only aspect my brain can comprehend.“I really enjoyed your class.”“Thank you, I’m glad you did.”“I see you have company. The famous James Fraser.”“You know him?”“The Don Juan of Edinburgh? Everyone knows James Fraser.”Don Juan of Edinburgh. Did I hear that right? What the bloody hell? “Oh? Tell me more.”“It’s common knowledge that Fraser is a lover of love. Women always fall for his romantic and charming ways. He never fails to…how shall I say this nicely…find himself the latest lady in town to smooth-talk and conquer.”Guard your heart, save your soul, Beauchamp. But what about the life flashing before me?In every single frame he is in it. Him and me. Us. Infinity. I laugh sarcastically. “Smooth-talk and conquer? It’s not the 18th century, Allan. Haven’t you learnt anything in my course?”“I’m happy to share more if you have the time.”“Actually, I don’t but thanks for the…mphm…information all the same. Well, have a nice holiday, Allan.”“You too, Professor Beauchamp. I’ll see you after Winter vacation.”I turn to leave when I feel a tug on my sleeve.“Please be careful.” He looks pointedly at Jamie.——-I slide into our booth and wind my arm around Jamie’s neck. He smiles and kisses my forehead lightly. He looks burdened.  “What’s amiss?”“Who is the lad?”“A student. Wrote a good paper last semester.”“He seems taken with ye, Claire.”More like he is trying to take you down a notch.Why is that?Is there any truth in his claims, Jamie?“Jamie! He’s a student.” I shrug.“A student canna has feelings for ye? He’s a man first, Sassenach. He has eyes, no?”  Jamie’s eyes narrow and a shadow seems to reside in them.Am I imagining his reaction? Is he hiding something?“I don’t care. He’s nothing to me. You on the other hand…”I lean in and kiss him again. I have no desire to stop. I run my hand down his back, pulling him closer. He kisses me hard, almost punishing in its intensity. So immersed are we in each other, we lose the track of time. When we finally came up for air, our lips are swollen. He rests his forehead on mine, his eyes dark and deep, they are almost black.“It’s getting late and I should walk ye home. Come, Sassanech…”I pout. He laughs. Kisses my nose and pulls me up into a hug. I nuzzle into his neck. I fit perfectly under his chin. I feel his lips in my hair.If this is a dream, I want to languish in it forever.With his hand around my shoulder and mine around his waist, we venture into the night, the black velvet sky a stage for the stars to sing its poetry of the ever-present puzzle of life and love.—-I slide under the covers, the taste of Jamie on my lips, the life of him imprinted on me. The lingering kiss at my doorstep and tender goodbye are blissful parting gifts, an almost perfect ending to a memorable evening. Almost.My heart is restless.My mind is unsettled.The events of the later part of the evening begin flashing on a loop.Don Juan of Edinburgh.Lover of love.Smooth-talker and conqueror.Please be careful. Allan Christie’s words. Why did I not tell Jamie?Do I not trust him?I trust him with my life. I don’t know Allan.But how well do I know Jamie Fraser? Is it possible to truly know someone? What happened to your amulet, Beauchamp? How do I cease negating my feelings? Pretending I do not care? Believing I do not crave his attention? I am failing miserably in resisting every single aspect that forms the essence of Jamie. Don Juan of Edinburgh.Lover of love.Smooth-talker and conqueror.Please be careful. The need to extract myself from this culture of doubt intensifies.My mind reaches out to caution, frantically grasping at its unbraiding. My traitorous heart rejoices, having lost the battle not too long ago.The noise within. It needs to be captured, stored, and locked away until (and if) it becomes relevant again. Remember.The me in the mirror.Embrace.The path where the swallow flies its heart’s desire, eschewing the sea of loss and despair.

                                                                        Hey!! Hope you’re well:) I had a question regarding the Outlander series, it seems that you’ve read the books and I wanted to ask about Fergus and Jamie’s relationship. Is it better than what is portrayed in the show? Is it significant? We are only shown a minimal amount and it saddens me bc Jamie has practically raised him as his own. And I hate myself for not reading the books first (I’ve started and love them so much!!) but I was just curious. Thanks in advance!! Take care :) 
                                                                    Let’s put it this way - the adaptation has proven problematic after S1 (maybe even towards the end where we didn’t get the important cave-healing scene). As for Jamie and Fergus - these two have a sweet and respectful relationship and it’s better in the books. Same goes for Jamie and Bree - their relationship is nothing like the show version. They had issues, which they managed and worked through in a generative manner. Book Bree is not as soulless as show Bree.
