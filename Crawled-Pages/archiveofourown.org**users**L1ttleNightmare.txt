    Summary
      (aka: the one in which the universe refuses to give Izuku a break) 
After being granted respite from abuse disguised as training, Izuku's time at UA is looking up. With internships on the horizon, it's looking like he can finally move on. 
Pity he picks a hero with an All Might sized blindspot.
