    Summary
      After the war is over and Voldemort is dead, Harry begins to have severe headaches and strange dreams. The dreams are as real they can be to him, it was almost as they could have been memories. But that would be impossible, because he does not know anyone by the name of Loki. That was his soul mate and let's not forget, a prince of Asgard. Harry would have known, especially if he  also was married to same man, which he was not.... right? But then how could he explain the band of flowers blooming up his underarm? It were identical to the one in his dreams and he could not denied the blooming feeling of love that filled his whole body and mind as he thought about the trickster god.

    Summary
      The Norns had cursed him, doomed Loki to meet the other half of his soul at the worst possible time. Now, he must shove her away before Thanos and the Other force her to share his fate. Unfortunately, the other half of his soul is stubborn, perhaps as much as he is, and no mere insult will make Holly Potter turn away.

    Summary
      Death and his three sisters the Norns had important plans for one Harry Potter and they would not let them be destroyed by a mere muggle.
After Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts, the violence at his relatives' house gets out of hand, but instead of dying that day, he awakes in Asgard. Happy for his new chance, he tries to lay low, but as always in his life, things do not go as planned and soon he draws the attention of a certain Jötun sorcerer. 
Loki has tried to save his realm for millennia, but with his adoptive father Odin Allfather refusing to give him the Casket of Ancient Winters, he grows desperate as he watches his land and people die. And his own magic is far too destructive and violent to save the land. What he needs is a source of creative magical power.

    Summary
      “And you seek to prevent all of this from happening again?”“Yes,” she returns simply. “After dealing with a megalomaniac that’s hell bent on my blood, though.”He blinks repeatedly, wondering if he actually heard her correctly. “What?”***When they're the last two left with the Realms collapsing around them, Loki uses dangerous magic to send Evelyn back to the beginning to do it all over again.  The Soul Magic has unexpected side effects, though.  Evelyn blames it on her damned Potter Luck.  With far more allies than originally expected, she and Loki set out to stop the end of the Nine Realms before it even starts.

    Summary
      “I am Loki,” he says in reply. He doesn’t continue. He is not of Asgard when he has forsaken it, he cannot claim to be an Odinson when it was never true. He certainly cannot claim to be a Laufeyson after killing his true father in cold blood. Loki is the only name he has. “I know,” is Harry’s reply. “How could you possibly know?” Harry shrugs. “I tend to know things. Perk of the job.”“And what is your job?”Harry turns to him, green eyes light. “Keeper of the keys.”

    Summary
      Loki, Harry and Merlin have a habit of dying only to reawaken without their previous scars, bruises, or injuries. The soulmate triad dies in battle, once again, in the 21st century  AD on Sunday, May-03-2020. Moments later, King Thor and his soulmate Bruce Banner decide to try their first attempt at Magic™. They intend on saving the Universe from Ragnarök by recreating a time-travel ritual Queen Frigga mentioned to Thor in passing moments before her death. Unsurprisingly the two horribly botch it up. To be precise it's now; June 23, 425 in the 5th century AD. Once again they're living on Midgard's continent of Avalon during the Middle Ages. Well… Well, they haven't lived this long without learning to adapt. Besides, it would be 'beyond stupid' and 'completely irresponsible' not to mention 'unbearably boring' to repeat the actions that led to Ragnarök the first time around. Wouldn't it?

    Summary
      When Loki let go and fell into the void, it was with his eyes closed and a smile on his lips, ready to be reunited with his love in his daughter's realm. 
Years later, when Loki is held captive on the helicarrier, smirk on his lips, waiting for everything to fall into place - who is this green-eyed beauty that stares at him so folornly, and why does his magic react so strongly in the man's presence?
