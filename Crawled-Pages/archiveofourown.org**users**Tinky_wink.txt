    Summary
      To get everyone used to the future, Jacob proposes to take the boys on a road trip out into the world while Miss P takes over the girls activities.To everybody's dismay, Miss Peregrine agrees. They get lost, the luggage gets nicked, nobody can get along and certain people are apparently fluent in other languages. What can go wrong? Lmao there's alot of Horace in this one ngl. Mixed between book and movie and also Victors alive for some reason.
