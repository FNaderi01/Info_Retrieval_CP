					Youthful misadventures have served Goldberg well. This year, he produced pre-teen comedy “Good Boys,” the first R-rated comedy since 2016 to open atop the box office. It was a homecoming of sorts, as Goldberg hit it big with the teen comedy “Superbad” (2007), which he and his Point Grey Pictures partner Seth Rogen began writing when they were teens themselves. He and Rogen got the second-two greenlight for their Amazon superhero series “The Boys” — before it even debuted in July 2019. Other projects include the big-screen political comedy “Long Shot,” starring Rogen and Charlize Theron, and the series “Future Man” (Hulu), “Black Monday” (Showtime) and “Preacher” (AMC), which wrapped its fourth and final season. In April, Point Grey signed a multi-platform deal with Lionsgate.
