    Summary
  “Kara.” Lena rushes forward, nearly tripping over her heels in her hurry to reach her best friend. Kara looks small in a woollen sweater and mismatching socks, and her eyes shine not with their usual enthusiasm but with tears. She stumbles into Lena’s arms already sobbing, and Lena sends a silent thank you to Jess for letting her be here.
 When Kara refuses sticky buns, Lena knows there is something seriously wrong with her best friend. An impromptu visit reveals not only the reason for Kara's uncharacteristic behaviour.Aka, the slightly different take on hurt/comfort.

      Lena was Kara's favorite person in the whole wide world and Supergirl was Lena's favorite person in the whole wide world. Needless to say, Kara was a little more than jealous. Why could Lena see how perfect she and Kara were? Oh right. It was because Supergirl was in the way. Why did she have to interfere!

    Summary
      When Kara comes out as asexual, she and Lena break up and instead agree to an open romantic friendship. But first, Lena needs some time and space from Kara in order to get over her sexual attraction.So Kara sends Alex (who just so happens to have broken up with Maggie just twelve days prior) to Lena's apartment to support her through the breakup.Turns out those two get along better than anyone would have expected.Takes place against the backdrop of season three, but I fixed it, so it's s3 where everyone talks and works together and there aren't secrets and also there's as little Mon-El as possible.

      Prompt fill: Andrea makes Lena beg to go down on her during a conference call after Lena has been naughty, and then afterwards Andrea makes Lena ride a big strap. Orgasm for both (But make Lena suffer). Pain play, Nipple biting (for both Andrea and Lena), anal, size kink, humiliation, Daddy Kink. Just as many hot kinks that can be crammed into filthy office sex. Genital slapping, spanking, praise kink. Oh deep throating while Andrea makes her grind on the tip of her stiletto…

    Summary
      Join Alex and Kara as they go on a journey of love and family.  We follow them from the first day they meet, to falling in love, getting married, having a family, and falling in love again, as they meet Maggie Sawyer and Lena Luthor to create the ultimate OT4.  There's love, sex, tons of fluff, a dash of angst to keep things interesting, and a few surprises hidden along the way.  Vaguely cannon compliant.  Sex scenes are marked with an asterisk on the Chapter Title, and a long row of XOXOXO before and after.  You know.  Because some people want to skip the sex, and some people want to skip right to it!  (Done upon request.)
