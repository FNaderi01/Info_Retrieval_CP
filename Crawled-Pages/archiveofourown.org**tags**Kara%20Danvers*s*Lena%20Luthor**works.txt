    Summary
      When two people who have been friends for a long time kiss in order to forget about the damage they did to themselves over the years, neither of them expects complications. But complications are exactly what they get because this kiss was enough to make both of them realize how much they loved one another, and nothing will ever be the same again.

    Summary
  “Kara.” Lena rushes forward, nearly tripping over her heels in her hurry to reach her best friend. Kara looks small in a woollen sweater and mismatching socks, and her eyes shine not with their usual enthusiasm but with tears. She stumbles into Lena’s arms already sobbing, and Lena sends a silent thank you to Jess for letting her be here.
 When Kara refuses sticky buns, Lena knows there is something seriously wrong with her best friend. An impromptu visit reveals not only the reason for Kara's uncharacteristic behaviour.Aka, the slightly different take on hurt/comfort.

    Summary
      Lena was Kara's favorite person in the whole wide world and Supergirl was Lena's favorite person in the whole wide world. Needless to say, Kara was a little more than jealous. Why could Lena see how perfect she and Kara were? Oh right. It was because Supergirl was in the way. Why did she have to interfere!

    Summary
      Join Alex and Kara as they go on a journey of love and family.  We follow them from the first day they meet, to falling in love, getting married, having a family, and falling in love again, as they meet Maggie Sawyer and Lena Luthor to create the ultimate OT4.  There's love, sex, tons of fluff, a dash of angst to keep things interesting, and a few surprises hidden along the way.  Vaguely cannon compliant.  Sex scenes are marked with an asterisk on the Chapter Title, and a long row of XOXOXO before and after.  You know.  Because some people want to skip the sex, and some people want to skip right to it!  (Done upon request.)

    Summary
      this is a collection of prompt fills for Supercorptober2020
ix. luthor
“Darling, I’m in a crossword puzzle.”
Spoon in her mouth, Kara shuffles on the couch, looking over the doorway where Lena is walking in post-work. There’s a frown on her face that Kara’s already gearing up to work against, fully prepared to punch people straight to space if it means Lena’s happy and safe. There will be time for ice cream later.
But when Lena looks up from the folded newspaper clutched in her hands—that Kara’s only now noticing—it isn’t a frown per se. Kara senses bewilderment more than a volatile rise in Lena’s temper, like Lena’s suspended in some state of disbelief.

Lena &amp; Kara don’t have an easy life and they are  far to realize that they are destined to create something wonderful together. Will they be able to treasure it? Or, will they be too broken to embrace the gift they got?
