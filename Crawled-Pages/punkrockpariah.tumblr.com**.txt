                gofundme.com            Hey guys. My friend Jay has been living in an abusive home their whole life. They are one of the sweetest, smartest, and honestly most loyal friends I’ve ever had. If you can’t donate a reblog would be appreciated. They are trying to get enough money to get their own apartment and is working the night shift whilst going to school during the day to make ends meet. Thanks for your help!

                                                Trump Supporters are all blind cowards too afraid to debate someone or address issues brought up to them cause they have no rebuttal and no defense for their prejudice
                                                                        illvminavt

But yeah no insult the person 12 years younger than you because you have to religiously defend your president you willing let 200,000 people die due to his complete and utter intentional mishandling of the situation. Plus his literal admitting on tape that he knew it was bad. Oh also the fact that he only paid $750 in taxes. 
                                                                        illvminavt

                                                                        illvminavt

Though most LGBTQs vote Democratic, new poll shows 45% of queer men backing Trump
                    Nearly 10 percent of the U.S. queer men who said they "do not support [Trump] at all" said that they will vote for him regardless.                
                Newsweek            Bruh…DOJ seeks data on nursing home deaths in 4 states led by Democrats
                    The governors' actions at the height of the pandemic were designed to ensure hospitals had enough bed space for the most serious COVID cases                
                NBC News            Bruh…Carney: NYT Attack on Trump's 'Financial Acumen' Is Nonsense
                    The Times swings and misses with a contradictory, odd-ball attack on the president based on decades of tax data.                
                Breitbart            Bruh!Oh yeah… i absolutely know it is a Breitbart story but please, after making sure my other two sources can’t be challenged by you, make sure you ignore the tax story because hurr durr right wing news.That would simply show YOUR bias.He gave the treasury department 5.2 million in 2016 and 2017 combined due to the audit he is undergoing so there were no back taxes and then payed $750 ON PAPER while it is ongoing.You can give the federal government all of your money and then use the overage as your tax payment over multiple years until that money runs out. Its better to put it in the bank however and pay what you owe when you owe it.The tax story was just for shock and awe. You fell for it.Bruh.And don’t be a little bitch calling out the ‘minor’ card when you are so punk it shouldn’t matter.
                                                                        punkrockpariah
                                                                        I’m playing the minor card because he wants to talk about a minors sex life. Yknow. Like a creep. Also I’m punk but I’m also Straight Edge. Also you can’t just not pay taxes for 15 years and go, “Oopsie daises! Now that I’m president let me give give you the money now that I’ve collected!” Like that’s not how that works g. Even if he gave 5.2 million he’d still be way short. It’s been over a decade and he’s a scumbag billionaire, yknow like his buddy Jeffery Epstein. And the gay men story? Cool. Outta the number polled 10% said yeah. Lemme take a cool swing at who they polled. White guys. Rich white guys. You know gay men aren’t the only part of the LGBT+ right? And yeah I don’t trust breitbart. They’re extremely biased. I also don’t watch CNN for the same reason. And again yeah I’m punk. Punk enough to put equality and human life over money. And the nursing home deaths? Yeah again I’m telling you. These are large urban areas with dense populations. Of course the virus is gonna spread faster. That’s how that works. You’re telling me that the governor of California had an equally hard time as the governor of Arkansas? 
                                                                        jonnyarmani

Wow… pretty good on ya. I’m certain the polling company has a list of rich white gay men they can call for information… weak take on your part there, BiafraThe tired old Epstein goal post. Keep moving that one buddy but here it is, Trump was the ONLY person willing to come forward and help prosecution towards Epstein in the Florida lawsuit before IT WAS DISMISSED. Sound like good friends.I was explaining the $750 fallacy but GO MOVE THOSE GOALPOSTS. (Thats must be wearing you out)And @illvminavt has no idea your age but you are old enough to stand in this arena and take swings at educated adults you will be treated as an adult.No one cares if you are straight edge.  (Good job on no drugs or alcohol, focus on your school and career - signed Dad.)Now… go to school, ignore the propaganda, and think for YOURSELF. It is very obvious you are in a massive echo chamber.Signed, a previous 80’s punk, liberal democrat anarchist that grew up, had a family, and saw the error in his thinking.P.S. Donald Trump was the first openly supporting president of the gay community. I absolutely can not understand how that is dismissed.
                                                                        punkrockpariah

Growing up near LA let’s you see what capitalism and mega corps do to the downtrodden. And yeah I’m playing age card when it comes to my sex life. I’d honestly have no trouble literally anywhere else, it just makes y’all sound like pedophiles when you talk about my dick. I think for myself. I don’t wear no hat with a single mans nationalist slogan on it. I don’t fly his flags. I don’t think like I’m in a cult. I’m an anarchist because I believe in morality and equality. You had a family, cracked under the pressure of capitalism and a Jack boot. And instead of realizing that the boot on your neck was bad you decided to roll over and lick it. You ain’t no punk. I swear to fuck man, y’all would get your asses kicked at a gig for this shit. And also. No I didn’t say that the governors were to blame and trump wasn’t. I said they were given an insanely hard task to deal with that was exacerbated by a moron in office who made his entire fan club think it was ok to go around not giving a shit and taking no precautions. 
                                                                        jonnyarmani

(I mean really BRUH… those arms must be really tired by now.)You are just a baby playing dress up. Just because you shop at hot topic and have a shitty attitude doesn’t make you punk. And no one was talking about your dick, thats YOU… and the word pedophile is owned by the left to call out their own. Trump took Corona seriously before any leftist fuck did, including your Govenor. I can pull receipts if you even care.But here it is.I’m done with you. You are shamefully set in your belief and pull the same tactics every little leftie pulls when faced with information. Move the posts and change the subject. Print this thread out and keep it close to your heart. As you grow older and your world views change through maturity you can look back at this and see that you were misled by the very people that you admire and gleam on to.Also, you literally have no idea my expansive history or what I have done in my youth. I was Detroit Punk… we shit on you Hollywood pretenders…Best of luck little man. Learn to open your mind to real discussion and don’t get butt hurt when people swing back at your sad attempts to ‘bash the fash’… lmfao. Oh my God its in his bio.
                                                                        punkrockpariah

Get your head caved in Gilman Street. Nose broken at The Smell. And shit stomped in some dudes garage.For the record I ain’t shopping at hot topic. I’m making my own shit. Also Trump has been a wildly unfriendly man when it comes to protecting LGBT+ rights. Supporting senators and members of his cabinet that violently oppress LGBT+ communities around the country. “Trump took it seriously.” Literal audio of him saying he wants to down play it. But you’re gonna run away with your tail tucked between your legs because you’ve met someone who’s lived 3 decades minimum less than you and has much better understanding of compassion for those who have been beaten and oppressed. 
                                                                        jonnyarmani

This isn’t a fight. This is an education for you. I cant help if you refuse to open your mind. Thats why I’m done.Again… your assumptions of me are without any merit. I don’t give a damn if you are gay. I don’t give a damn about anybodies sexuality. But I detest when people make their preferred genitalia their whole persona. Because it is weakness. There is no need to improve one’s self when your whole existence relies on where you stick your junk.Good luck. Hope you find internal peace someday.

                                                                        punkrockpariah

I’m just not a greedy fucking capitalist. Rebellion starts whenever it go damn feels like it. Whether it’s at 12 listening to The Clash in my bedroom or at 17 punching bigots like you in the face. You can “destroy me with facts” (more like half baked opinions based on your bitterness towards the youth) all you want. It doesn’t change the fact that you’re all just posturing. I don’t need a lesson in humility, cuz I understand that I’m always a bad day away from living on the street. Yet I’m still trying my best to stick my neck out for those who need help. You got sad, old, and greedy. Like we get it, you’re back hurts and you’ve got arthritis. Take it out on the system that abandoned you and not turn it on the youth and oppressed to feel powerful. 
                                                                        saltycrackerass

                                                                        the-davest-of-uncles

How dare Gays have a different viewpoint you don’t agree with. So we must be some sort of traitor, right? Never mind the fact that we’re all unique individuals who will see the world in different lights. You’ve reduced us strictly down to our sexuality. Which is just what my homophobic family does, as well.Rather than tossing insults around like a child throwing a tantrum, maybe you should listen to your own words and actually be open for discussions next time.If you want a debate, I’m open to it.
                                                                        punkrockpariah
                                                                        Bruh. Cmon. I’ve been debating people for legit a full day. By myself, on different threads. Also yeah. No you are a traitor actually. In the GOPs actual agenda it says the wanna reverse the decision to make it illegal to refuse to provide goods or services based on sexuality. I’m tossing insults as well cuz you can only take so many, “communist faggots” before you start slinging back. Now you can give your piece but it’s like ghost voting for the ghostbusters. 
                                                                        sapphicconservative
                                                                        While I don’t support name calling to any regard, you didn’t help yourself any with this matter at all. You started off by calling your opponents strong words, so of course they’re going to retaliate with strong words. I’ve been in similar positions as you. I’ve had upwards of 100 people send me anon hate from graphic to vague descriptions in the span of a few hours. You being flustered is understandable, but please try to keep your head high or you’ll give them more ammo as to why non-Trump supporters are worse.“I’ve been debating people for legit a full day.”Then, I suppose that revokes your original claim about Trump supporters. Regardless, I was more so talking about a debate whenever you want, not necessarily now or on this post. So long as debates remain civil, I’m open to them.“No you are a traitor actually.”Then I stand by my original claim. You are homophobic for thinking all LGBT+ people have to think a certain way or we’re some traitor. My sexuality does not determine my political beliefs, and vice versa. Furthermore, do you really think I wouldn’t speak out against homophobia when I see it?I’ve been part of the conservative community for almost a full decade and I can assure you that the average conservative doesn’t care who you love so long as you don’t make it your sole personality trait. The worst homophobia I’ve received has all been from the left when they realize I’m a “traitor”. They were the ones to constantly hurl death and rape threats at me.“In the GOPs actual agenda it says it wants the wanna reverse the decision to make it illegal to refuse to provide good or services based on sexuality.”Sources needed, but I think I know what you’re talking about. This is a case of finding a balance between religious and civil liberties to make sure both are equally protected. Reforming the law on sexuality a bit would greatly protect our religious liberties. We can still be married and such, but people should have the right to determine if they want to participate in something that violates their religion. A muslim or Christian should have the right to say they aren’t going to bake a cake for a same sex marriage. If there was a religion for it, a same sex couple should be able to turn away a straight couple for similar reasons.“I’m tossing insults as well cuz you can only take so many, “communist f*ggots” before you start slinging back.“And again, you started off with calling others insults. Them retaliating with insults shouldn’t be such a shocking revelation to you. That, and I wasn’t really rude to you. I pointed out how your message came off homophobic, and you were the one who retaliated with vitriol. So, your excuse is rather weak. Unfortunately, you gave many people exactly what they wanted.
                                                                        punkrockpariah
                                                                        No no no. You’re a lesbian sure. That’s a fact. But you are t welcome in LGBT+ spaces because again the GOP is a threat. They have a 67 page agenda and on page 19 it says the wanna reverse the decision protecting same sex couples from discrimination. It not only allows people to refuse them service cuz they’re religious, but also because they just don’t like gays. That’s discrimination and homophobic. You’re homophobic for supporting Trump and Pence. Pence especially, a violent homophobe who caused an aids crisis in Indiana and supporters conversion camps. Second off NO! No one should be allowed to discriminate based off anything! Religion or otherwise it’s homophobia and it’s not ok! If your religion doesn’t support gays your religion is shit! You think I haven’t gotten death threats? You’re insanely naive if you think I think people should think the same. I just think that you supporting some who directly harms the group the you care oh so much about, makes you… now what’s the word? Oh right! A fucking traitor! After all the progress for LGBT+ rights, hard fought change, you turned your back on those who paved the path in their own blood so you could have rights, and then you supported the people they fought so hard against. 
                                                                        sapphicconservative
                                                                        “But you are t welcome in LGBT+ spaces”I’m sorry, but that’s not for you to decide on. The LGBT+ community is solely a community connected by not being cisgender or heterosexual. You can’t exclude people you don’t like from being in the community. Might as well rename the LGBT+ community to a branch of left-wing politics at this rate. Ironically, I feel much more welcomed in conservative spaces.“They have a 67 page agenda and on page 19 it says the wanna reverse the decision protecting same sex couples from discrimination.”Again, source needed. If it is what I think it is, then I politely disagree. Religious freedom and civil liberties are both important and we need to find a balance to best protect both. Also, I’m an atheist but I’m not anti-religion. In most religions, same sex relationships are frowned upon because they believe you should only have sex to reproduce. In some religions, it is a bond between you, your partner, and your religion’s god.I know a good amount of religious folks who support LGBT+ people but would prefer if they didn’t provide services that would go against their religion. I.e. baking a cake makes them a participant in a marriage going against their religion. The government has no authority to decide what people can and can’t do with their private businesses. That’s too authoritarian for me.“Pence especially, a violent homophobe who caused the an aids crisis in Indiana and supporters conversion camps.”I have no comment on the aids crisis, but he supports willing conversion therapy from what I read. He’s never stated supporting electric shock therapy. I don’t like using Snopes, but it goes over it well enough, surprisingly. Source. There’s a distinct difference between supporting forced conversion therapy and wanting that option to be held open for others to willingly have. It’s much less malicious on his end.In fact, he actually willingly participated in conversion therapy, which explains why he holds the stance on keeping it open for willing people to use. Source.“You think I haven’t gotten death threats?”No, I mentioned I’ve been in a similar position as you and have an understanding of the stress and such you feel with this post. Knowing how Tumblr can be with discourse of any kind, I’d be surprised if you didn’t receive death threats from this post, unfortunately.“You’re insanely naive if you think I think people should think the same.”But, you have an issue with LGBT+ people supporting people you don’t like? Calling us traitors. What other conclusion should I come to? I’m free to see information and form my own opinion. I’m free to weigh up my priorities and vote for people who will vote for the issues I want to see handled. I rank both religious freedom and civil liberties equally in what I want protected. You rank civil liberties way above religious freedom. There’s nothing inherently wrong with either.“you supported the people they fought so hard against.”No offense, but you’re infantilizing me here if you really believe I won’t speak out against homophobic stances. If I see it and truly believe that is homophobia, then I speak against it. I haven’t turned my back against anyone, but the LGBT+ community has turned their back on me because they see my stances at a surface level and refuse to hear me out. Instead, they call me a traitor and accuse me of being fake or an old man because they can’t fathom someone goes against their narrative.

It’s obvious that OP’s been told to hate along with having been told what to believe, and because of that they feed every negative response into the justification to hate, treating death threats and calm rebuttal with the same level of vitreol. Because that’s all they have.And that’s without me commenting on ANY teen claiming to be punk. I mean fuck, there’s a reason why the phrase is ‘Punk is dead, and Punk killed it.’
                                                                        punkrockpariah

Have you ever considered you were spoon fed your beliefs as well and that’s literally how the world works whether your a isolated farmer from Siberia or a barista in a Starbucks. You were fed you rhetoric. I bucked the rhetoric that I was fed. I get yelled at irl a lot for being too extreme. And what happened to me is I was born into a time period where the government was and still is in the Middle East for no fucking reason. Where people knew that climate change is real and ignore it anyways. Where civil rights are tossed to the wayside daily and no one says a word. If you’re not angry you haven’t been paying attention
                                                                        cookingwithroxy

Like, I really do not expect actual sentience out of you for another fifteen years most likely, even at best I wouldn’t consider you possible of full cognitive ability for at least another seven. And I’ve read your posts, you buck NOTHING. You maybe shed the party line of where you started, but you only rebelled long enough to find a different party line to hew right to and repeat verbatim as people point out the flaws in your arguments.I mean fuck, everyone was born to a time of trials and wars in the middle east, that’s pretty much standard. AND Climate panic, that’s been going on since the 60′s and earlier! The world is, despite what you think, a lot better than it was twenty years ago, thirty years ago. You don’t even have to worry about the fucking Ozone layer!You’re not a rebel, because your rebellion ended the moment you found someone who hated the status quo you were born in. I get that this is all new and exciting to you, but to me? Well, I’ll go back to your own standards and point out that you’re a minor, and too fucking young to have anything resembling a perspective.Or to misquote another, ‘You’re not punk, you just shop at Hot Topic’.

                                                                        punkrockpariah

The status quo I was born in is all the rich kids thinking they’re better than me and bullying me for years. The status quo I was born in is the fundemental systemic oppression of minority groups. The status quo I was born into is a country so skewed to the right that they think they can debate who has civil rights. And that the people saying, “all people should be equal.” Are radical leftists? Also quick note: Just cuz things aren’t as bad as they used to be doesn’t mean they’re good. If you used to be on fire but now your drowning, you still have a lot of fucking work to do.I’m not a leftist or a rightie. I’m not Republican nor Democrat. Conservative or liberal. I’m a human being who values human life. The status quo until 4 years ago was gay people legally not being allowed to marry. The status quo is your status quo. Punk didn’t cannibalize itself. It’s ideals of justice, freedom, and equality were ousted from the brief pocket of mainstream it got. And no self respecting punk is a conservative or Republican. You guys stand in direct opposition at the moment to progress and equality. And Trump supporters even less so. Take what I just said and times that by ten. Punk didn’t destroy itself it just kicked you the fuck out. You just didn’t like that all these bands were using their music to convey an important message. All you wanted was to mosh and hurt people. You weren’t and never will be a punk. Nor will you ever understand that punk is about more than picking which color you wanna blindly follow. If I was following the status quo I’d be some alt right shill on 4-Chan. Instead I’m out here fighting for my fellow human because they deserve better. You can talk all the shit you want but a jock still lives inside your head. Again, Joe Strummer, Henry Rollins, Jello Biafra, Fat Mike, Billie Joe Armstrong, Greg Graffin, and Ian MacKaye would all spit in your face. @cookingwithroxy

Hell, you don’t get to call yourself an ally to progress when your reaction to someone criticizing your position is to label them an enemy.You literally don’t know jack shit about the people arguing with you, BECAUSE YOU REFUSE TO LISTEN. You just run along your little well worn ruts, convinced that you’re right as you keep repeating the same lies to yourself that you were told. That you are right, and everyone who disagrees with you is a bigot and a monster.This is why I keep saying your punk isn’t punk, regardless of where you bought in. One, because it’s painfully obvious that your rebellion is only against your particular status quo. Like, literally against your particular status quo, and nothing else.And two, because you know NOTHING about the people you’re arguing with. You instead build up a comfortable nest of lies in your head, and try to fit everyone into the pre-arranged slots you’ve built there. That none of them fit doesn’t matter, because you’re actually incapable of the self-reflection needed to recognize the flaws.So here, at long last, is yet another little bit of ‘my god you’re just an idiot’ for ya. I was never part of the Punk scene. I watched it from the outside. Never moshed. Barely listened to the music. What I listened to were Punks, talking about what was happening to the scene. What the new kids and the rich kids were doing to it.And that’s what makes it embarrassing, that you think I give a single solitary fuck what HENRY ROLLINS of all people would think of me. The man thinks that anger and physical strength is the only thing of value, and you think I’m supposed to be looking to him as some idol?Some day you’ll grow up. Mainly you’ll grow out of the testosterone fug that is your teenage years and stop thinking anger and rage is the way to deal with anyone questioning your views. When that day comes, I’ll still be here, and I’ll still be fighting to fix the problems you’re causing right now.Because I, for one, believe in equality and a brighter future. And you’re still fighting the made up jocks and rich kids inside your head.Oh, and because fuck it I’ve actually got a sassy image appropriate for this and I want to use it?
                                                                        silverscreenx

The lgbt community is not some left leaning political stance (although most people in it are), the community is for those who aren’t cisgender or straight.People already struggle with their sexualities and gender, no need to add anymore bullshit to it.
                                                                        sapphicconservative

There is no political opinion you must have to be in the community. All that is required of you is to not be cisgender and/or straight. Anyone who tries to gatekeep based on politics cannot tolerate sharing a space with someone who thinks differently. Communism is very anti-LGBT+, but I don’t tell communists they aren’t welcome in the community because the community is not inherently political.My sexuality is not political. My community based on my sexuality is not political.To all LGBT+ people who don’t lean left - it’s absolutely okay to walk away from the Democrat party. We are free to form our own political opinions and support the people we want. This isn’t a call to support Republicans, this is a call to support whoever you want and not give in to the hive mind many people try to enforce on the LGBT+ community.
                                                                        punkrockpariah

Because the people in government, mainly Republicans, are making it a political issue. It’s a fucked up shitty thing, but Black people have had to deal with the color of their skin being political forever just the same as we have. The reason why I said that you aren’t welcome into community spaces is because you support beliefs and people that actively harm the community itself. Its like a black personn saying, “yknow… the Klan isn’t that bad when you think about it.” At a BLM march. Or like someone in Ireland saying “I actually really like the Black and Tans and the UDF! The Brits are alright with me!” It doesn’t make sense because its a person who should be a member of the community fighting for freedom and rights, instead supporting those who take those rights away. 
                                                                        sapphicconservative

We are unique individuals united by not being straight and/or cis. Our beliefs and interests will all wildly vary. We can save our politics for other times and instead focus on other aspects. In fact, this is why LGBT+ organizations have popped up to fight for political issues centering around our rights.“Because the people in government, mainly Republicans, are making it a political issue.”Small correction, Democrats are guilty of this just as much. Both frontline their LGBT+ stances and equally push forward issues centering around LGBT+. Sometimes I agree with the Democratic stance and sometimes I agree with the Republican stance here. It all depends on how far either side are taking it.“you support beliefs and people that actively harm the community itself … it doesn’t make sense”Hmm… Instead of calling someone a traitor, I recommend to asking why they believe a certain way. You will never change someone’s mind or convince them otherwise on their beliefs if you insult them. Regardless, I can understand how you’d be confused, and I’m more than willing to clarify my stances.First, what are my beliefs I uphold that harm the community? Is it where I said I treat civil rights and religious freedom equally? Or, is there something new here?Second, I’ve already mentioned that I am more than capable of not supporting a decision and speaking out if it harms the LGBT+ community. While I support most of what Trump pushes forward, I still have a few platforms of his I don’t fully agree with. In fact, when compared to the rest of the candidates, his platform best matches my stances - 3rd parties included. Do you uphold a strict nonsupport towards Joe Biden for all of his racism both new and old?
                                                                        lozfanxv
but Black people have had to deal with the color of their skin being political forever just the same as we have.
Why the fuck did they bring race into this? I don’t remember bringing up Black people, do you remember doing that, Sapphicconservative? How fucking dare you play the minority race card as some way to silence us. What is with the far left and using minorites as playing cards? You do know that there are Black Republicans, right? In fact, one of ten Black Americans identify as Republican. Can’t really blame to be honest, people of the far left only seem to care about them when you try to silence opposing views by using them.But hey, if you really wanna bring up the Black Americans and Democrats, let me give you a history lesson, honey.
June 10, 1964Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen (R-IL) criticized the Democrat filibuster against 1964 Civil Rights Act and called on Democrats to stop opposing racial equality. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was introduced and approved by a majority of Republicans in the Senate. The Act was opposed by most southern Democrat senators, several of whom were proud segregationists — one of them being Al Gore Sr. (D). President Lyndon B. Johnson relied on Illinois Senator Everett Dirksen, the Republican leader from Illinois, to get the Act passed.August 4, 1965Senate Leader Everett Dirksen (R-IL) overcame Democrat attempts to block 1965 Voting Rights Act. Ninety-four percent of Republicans voted for the landmark civil rights legislation while 27% of Democrats opposed. The Voting Rights Act of 1965, abolishing literacy tests and other measures devised by Democrats to prevent blacks from voting, was signed into law. A higher percentage of Republicans voted in favor.February 19, 1976President Gerald Ford formally rescinded President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s notorious Executive Order 9066 authorizing the internment of over 120,000 Japanese-Americans during WWII.September 15, 1981President Ronald Reagan established the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities to increase black participation in federal education programs.June 29, 1982President Ronald Reagan signed a 25-year extension of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.August 10, 1988President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, compensating Japanese-Americans for the deprivation of their civil rights and property during the World War II internment ordered by FDR.November 21, 1991President George H. W. Bush signed the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to strengthen federal civil rights legislation.August 20, 1996A bill authored by U.S. Rep. Susan Molinari (R-NY) to prohibit racial discrimination in adoptions, part of Republicans’ “Contract With America”, became law.July 2, 2010Clinton says Byrd joined KKK to help him get electedJust a “fleeting association”. Nothing to see here.
PS: Lyndon Johnson, after signing the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965, got on an airplane full of governors and told them that after setting those bills in motion, “I’ll have those (N-word) voting Democrat the next 200 years”.
Don’t ever bring up Black Americans again as some sort of gotcha. It makes you look even more like an asshole.
The reason why I said that you aren’t welcome into community spaces is because you support beliefs and people that actively harm the community itself.What about her beliefs makes her dangerous to go into our spaces? I believe that Democrats don’t care for us either. Not only that, but I don’t consider myself Democratic because I don’t agree with many of what they push. Most glaringly they are pro gun control. Something that is a danger to us in the LGBT community, who are targeted by bigots and need something to defend ourselves.

                                                                        private-first-class-lavernius

                                                                        punkrockpariah

                                                                        private-first-class-lavernius

                                                                        punkrockpariah

                                                                        private-first-class-lavernius

Believing in the constitution? Serving my country maybe? (Ooh i bet your going to bring up oil or something,thats a standard go-to)Because for someone thats “punk” you seem hellbent on staying in step on cookie cutter left side rhetoric instead of rebelling against both systems entirely 
                                                                        punkrockpariah

I literally want to destroy the government. Leftist rhetoric fuck outta here. If you wanna get hitched then go read my other reblogs because you’re soooooo unoriginal. And your views aren’t unpopular. You hold the same views as almost half the country so shut the fuck up unless you have anything to say of substance

                                                Trump Supporters are all blind cowards too afraid to debate someone or address issues brought up to them cause they have no rebuttal and no defense for their prejudice
                                                                        illvminavt

                                                                        punkrockpariah

But yeah no insult the person 12 years younger than you because you have to religiously defend your president you willing let 200,000 people die due to his complete and utter intentional mishandling of the situation. Plus his literal admitting on tape that he knew it was bad. Oh also the fact that he only paid $750 in taxes. 
                                                                        illvminavt

                                                                        illvminavt

                                                                        jonnyarmani
Though most LGBTQs vote Democratic, new poll shows 45% of queer men backing Trump
                    Nearly 10 percent of the U.S. queer men who said they "do not support [Trump] at all" said that they will vote for him regardless.                
                Newsweek            Bruh…DOJ seeks data on nursing home deaths in 4 states led by Democrats
                    The governors' actions at the height of the pandemic were designed to ensure hospitals had enough bed space for the most serious COVID cases                
                NBC News            Bruh…Carney: NYT Attack on Trump's 'Financial Acumen' Is Nonsense
                    The Times swings and misses with a contradictory, odd-ball attack on the president based on decades of tax data.                
                Breitbart            Bruh!Oh yeah… i absolutely know it is a Breitbart story but please, after making sure my other two sources can’t be challenged by you, make sure you ignore the tax story because hurr durr right wing news.That would simply show YOUR bias.He gave the treasury department 5.2 million in 2016 and 2017 combined due to the audit he is undergoing so there were no back taxes and then payed $750 ON PAPER while it is ongoing.You can give the federal government all of your money and then use the overage as your tax payment over multiple years until that money runs out. Its better to put it in the bank however and pay what you owe when you owe it.The tax story was just for shock and awe. You fell for it.Bruh.And don’t be a little bitch calling out the ‘minor’ card when you are so punk it shouldn’t matter.
                                                                        punkrockpariah
                                                                        I’m playing the minor card because he wants to talk about a minors sex life. Yknow. Like a creep. Also I’m punk but I’m also Straight Edge. Also you can’t just not pay taxes for 15 years and go, “Oopsie daises! Now that I’m president let me give give you the money now that I’ve collected!” Like that’s not how that works g. Even if he gave 5.2 million he’d still be way short. It’s been over a decade and he’s a scumbag billionaire, yknow like his buddy Jeffery Epstein. And the gay men story? Cool. Outta the number polled 10% said yeah. Lemme take a cool swing at who they polled. White guys. Rich white guys. You know gay men aren’t the only part of the LGBT+ right? And yeah I don’t trust breitbart. They’re extremely biased. I also don’t watch CNN for the same reason. And again yeah I’m punk. Punk enough to put equality and human life over money. And the nursing home deaths? Yeah again I’m telling you. These are large urban areas with dense populations. Of course the virus is gonna spread faster. That’s how that works. You’re telling me that the governor of California had an equally hard time as the governor of Arkansas? 
                                                                        jonnyarmani

Wow… pretty good on ya. I’m certain the polling company has a list of rich white gay men they can call for information… weak take on your part there, BiafraThe tired old Epstein goal post. Keep moving that one buddy but here it is, Trump was the ONLY person willing to come forward and help prosecution towards Epstein in the Florida lawsuit before IT WAS DISMISSED. Sound like good friends.I was explaining the $750 fallacy but GO MOVE THOSE GOALPOSTS. (Thats must be wearing you out)And @illvminavt has no idea your age but you are old enough to stand in this arena and take swings at educated adults you will be treated as an adult.No one cares if you are straight edge.  (Good job on no drugs or alcohol, focus on your school and career - signed Dad.)Now… go to school, ignore the propaganda, and think for YOURSELF. It is very obvious you are in a massive echo chamber.Signed, a previous 80’s punk, liberal democrat anarchist that grew up, had a family, and saw the error in his thinking.P.S. Donald Trump was the first openly supporting president of the gay community. I absolutely can not understand how that is dismissed.
                                                                        punkrockpariah
                                                                        The man isn’t a gay ally. He picked Pence has VPSecondly you weren’t a punk. Cuz punks give a shit about this hurt and needy. Growing up near LA let’s you see what capitalism and mega corps do to the downtrodden. And yeah I’m playing age card when it comes to my sex life. I’d honestly have no trouble literally anywhere else, it just makes y’all sound like pedophiles when you talk about my dick. I think for myself. I don’t wear no hat with a single mans nationalist slogan on it. I don’t fly his flags. I don’t think like I’m in a cult. I’m an anarchist because I believe in morality and equality. You had a family, cracked under the pressure of capitalism and a Jack boot. And instead of realizing that the boot on your neck was bad you decided to roll over and lick it. You ain’t no punk. I swear to fuck man, y’all would get your asses kicked at a gig for this shit. And also. No I didn’t say that the governors were to blame and trump wasn’t. I said they were given an insanely hard task to deal with that was exacerbated by a moron in office who made his entire fan club think it was ok to go around not giving a shit and taking no precautions. 
                                                                        jonnyarmani

(I mean really BRUH… those arms must be really tired by now.)You are just a baby playing dress up. Just because you shop at hot topic and have a shitty attitude doesn’t make you punk. And no one was talking about your dick, thats YOU… and the word pedophile is owned by the left to call out their own. Trump took Corona seriously before any leftist fuck did, including your Govenor. I can pull receipts if you even care.But here it is.I’m done with you. You are shamefully set in your belief and pull the same tactics every little leftie pulls when faced with information. Move the posts and change the subject. Print this thread out and keep it close to your heart. As you grow older and your world views change through maturity you can look back at this and see that you were misled by the very people that you admire and gleam on to.Also, you literally have no idea my expansive history or what I have done in my youth. I was Detroit Punk… we shit on you Hollywood pretenders…Best of luck little man. Learn to open your mind to real discussion and don’t get butt hurt when people swing back at your sad attempts to ‘bash the fash’… lmfao. Oh my God its in his bio.
                                                                        punkrockpariah

Get your head caved in Gilman Street. Nose broken at The Smell. And shit stomped in some dudes garage.For the record I ain’t shopping at hot topic. I’m making my own shit. Also Trump has been a wildly unfriendly man when it comes to protecting LGBT+ rights. Supporting senators and members of his cabinet that violently oppress LGBT+ communities around the country. “Trump took it seriously.” Literal audio of him saying he wants to down play it. But you’re gonna run away with your tail tucked between your legs because you’ve met someone who’s lived 3 decades minimum less than you and has much better understanding of compassion for those who have been beaten and oppressed. 
                                                                        jonnyarmani

This isn’t a fight. This is an education for you. I cant help if you refuse to open your mind. Thats why I’m done.Again… your assumptions of me are without any merit. I don’t give a damn if you are gay. I don’t give a damn about anybodies sexuality. But I detest when people make their preferred genitalia their whole persona. Because it is weakness. There is no need to improve one’s self when your whole existence relies on where you stick your junk.Good luck. Hope you find internal peace someday.

                                                                        punkrockpariah

I’m just not a greedy fucking capitalist. Rebellion starts whenever it go damn feels like it. Whether it’s at 12 listening to The Clash in my bedroom or at 17 punching bigots like you in the face. You can “destroy me with facts” (more like half baked opinions based on your bitterness towards the youth) all you want. It doesn’t change the fact that you’re all just posturing. I don’t need a lesson in humility, cuz I understand that I’m always a bad day away from living on the street. Yet I’m still trying my best to stick my neck out for those who need help. You got sad, old, and greedy. Like we get it, you’re back hurts and you’ve got arthritis. Take it out on the system that abandoned you and not turn it on the youth and oppressed to feel powerful. 
                                                                        saltycrackerass

                                                                        the-davest-of-uncles

How dare Gays have a different viewpoint you don’t agree with. So we must be some sort of traitor, right? Never mind the fact that we’re all unique individuals who will see the world in different lights. You’ve reduced us strictly down to our sexuality. Which is just what my homophobic family does, as well.Rather than tossing insults around like a child throwing a tantrum, maybe you should listen to your own words and actually be open for discussions next time.If you want a debate, I’m open to it.
                                                                        punkrockpariah
                                                                        Bruh. Cmon. I’ve been debating people for legit a full day. By myself, on different threads. Also yeah. No you are a traitor actually. In the GOPs actual agenda it says the wanna reverse the decision to make it illegal to refuse to provide goods or services based on sexuality. I’m tossing insults as well cuz you can only take so many, “communist faggots” before you start slinging back. Now you can give your piece but it’s like ghost voting for the ghostbusters. 
                                                                        sapphicconservative
                                                                        While I don’t support name calling to any regard, you didn’t help yourself any with this matter at all. You started off by calling your opponents strong words, so of course they’re going to retaliate with strong words. I’ve been in similar positions as you. I’ve had upwards of 100 people send me anon hate from graphic to vague descriptions in the span of a few hours. You being flustered is understandable, but please try to keep your head high or you’ll give them more ammo as to why non-Trump supporters are worse.“I’ve been debating people for legit a full day.”Then, I suppose that revokes your original claim about Trump supporters. Regardless, I was more so talking about a debate whenever you want, not necessarily now or on this post. So long as debates remain civil, I’m open to them.“No you are a traitor actually.”Then I stand by my original claim. You are homophobic for thinking all LGBT+ people have to think a certain way or we’re some traitor. My sexuality does not determine my political beliefs, and vice versa. Furthermore, do you really think I wouldn’t speak out against homophobia when I see it?I’ve been part of the conservative community for almost a full decade and I can assure you that the average conservative doesn’t care who you love so long as you don’t make it your sole personality trait. The worst homophobia I’ve received has all been from the left when they realize I’m a “traitor”. They were the ones to constantly hurl death and rape threats at me.“In the GOPs actual agenda it says it wants the wanna reverse the decision to make it illegal to refuse to provide good or services based on sexuality.”Sources needed, but I think I know what you’re talking about. This is a case of finding a balance between religious and civil liberties to make sure both are equally protected. Reforming the law on sexuality a bit would greatly protect our religious liberties. We can still be married and such, but people should have the right to determine if they want to participate in something that violates their religion. A muslim or Christian should have the right to say they aren’t going to bake a cake for a same sex marriage. If there was a religion for it, a same sex couple should be able to turn away a straight couple for similar reasons.“I’m tossing insults as well cuz you can only take so many, “communist f*ggots” before you start slinging back.“And again, you started off with calling others insults. Them retaliating with insults shouldn’t be such a shocking revelation to you. That, and I wasn’t really rude to you. I pointed out how your message came off homophobic, and you were the one who retaliated with vitriol. So, your excuse is rather weak. Unfortunately, you gave many people exactly what they wanted.
                                                                        punkrockpariah
                                                                        No no no. You’re a lesbian sure. That’s a fact. But you are t welcome in LGBT+ spaces because again the GOP is a threat. They have a 67 page agenda and on page 19 it says the wanna reverse the decision protecting same sex couples from discrimination. It not only allows people to refuse them service cuz they’re religious, but also because they just don’t like gays. That’s discrimination and homophobic. You’re homophobic for supporting Trump and Pence. Pence especially, a violent homophobe who caused an aids crisis in Indiana and supporters conversion camps. Second off NO! No one should be allowed to discriminate based off anything! Religion or otherwise it’s homophobia and it’s not ok! If your religion doesn’t support gays your religion is shit! You think I haven’t gotten death threats? You’re insanely naive if you think I think people should think the same. I just think that you supporting some who directly harms the group the you care oh so much about, makes you… now what’s the word? Oh right! A fucking traitor! After all the progress for LGBT+ rights, hard fought change, you turned your back on those who paved the path in their own blood so you could have rights, and then you supported the people they fought so hard against. 
                                                                        sapphicconservative
                                                                        “But you are t welcome in LGBT+ spaces”I’m sorry, but that’s not for you to decide on. The LGBT+ community is solely a community connected by not being cisgender or heterosexual. You can’t exclude people you don’t like from being in the community. Might as well rename the LGBT+ community to a branch of left-wing politics at this rate. Ironically, I feel much more welcomed in conservative spaces.“They have a 67 page agenda and on page 19 it says the wanna reverse the decision protecting same sex couples from discrimination.”Again, source needed. If it is what I think it is, then I politely disagree. Religious freedom and civil liberties are both important and we need to find a balance to best protect both. Also, I’m an atheist but I’m not anti-religion. In most religions, same sex relationships are frowned upon because they believe you should only have sex to reproduce. In some religions, it is a bond between you, your partner, and your religion’s god.I know a good amount of religious folks who support LGBT+ people but would prefer if they didn’t provide services that would go against their religion. I.e. baking a cake makes them a participant in a marriage going against their religion. The government has no authority to decide what people can and can’t do with their private businesses. That’s too authoritarian for me.“Pence especially, a violent homophobe who caused the an aids crisis in Indiana and supporters conversion camps.”I have no comment on the aids crisis, but he supports willing conversion therapy from what I read. He’s never stated supporting electric shock therapy. I don’t like using Snopes, but it goes over it well enough, surprisingly. Source. There’s a distinct difference between supporting forced conversion therapy and wanting that option to be held open for others to willingly have. It’s much less malicious on his end.In fact, he actually willingly participated in conversion therapy, which explains why he holds the stance on keeping it open for willing people to use. Source.“You think I haven’t gotten death threats?”No, I mentioned I’ve been in a similar position as you and have an understanding of the stress and such you feel with this post. Knowing how Tumblr can be with discourse of any kind, I’d be surprised if you didn’t receive death threats from this post, unfortunately.“You’re insanely naive if you think I think people should think the same.”But, you have an issue with LGBT+ people supporting people you don’t like? Calling us traitors. What other conclusion should I come to? I’m free to see information and form my own opinion. I’m free to weigh up my priorities and vote for people who will vote for the issues I want to see handled. I rank both religious freedom and civil liberties equally in what I want protected. You rank civil liberties way above religious freedom. There’s nothing inherently wrong with either.“you supported the people they fought so hard against.”No offense, but you’re infantilizing me here if you really believe I won’t speak out against homophobic stances. If I see it and truly believe that is homophobia, then I speak against it. I haven’t turned my back against anyone, but the LGBT+ community has turned their back on me because they see my stances at a surface level and refuse to hear me out. Instead, they call me a traitor and accuse me of being fake or an old man because they can’t fathom someone goes against their narrative.

It’s obvious that OP’s been told to hate along with having been told what to believe, and because of that they feed every negative response into the justification to hate, treating death threats and calm rebuttal with the same level of vitreol. Because that’s all they have.And that’s without me commenting on ANY teen claiming to be punk. I mean fuck, there’s a reason why the phrase is ‘Punk is dead, and Punk killed it.’
                                                                        punkrockpariah

Have you ever considered you were spoon fed your beliefs as well and that’s literally how the world works whether your a isolated farmer from Siberia or a barista in a Starbucks. You were fed you rhetoric. I bucked the rhetoric that I was fed. I get yelled at irl a lot for being too extreme. And what happened to me is I was born into a time period where the government was and still is in the Middle East for no fucking reason. Where people knew that climate change is real and ignore it anyways. Where civil rights are tossed to the wayside daily and no one says a word. If you’re not angry you haven’t been paying attention
                                                                        cookingwithroxy

Like, I really do not expect actual sentience out of you for another fifteen years most likely, even at best I wouldn’t consider you possible of full cognitive ability for at least another seven. And I’ve read your posts, you buck NOTHING. You maybe shed the party line of where you started, but you only rebelled long enough to find a different party line to hew right to and repeat verbatim as people point out the flaws in your arguments.I mean fuck, everyone was born to a time of trials and wars in the middle east, that’s pretty much standard. AND Climate panic, that’s been going on since the 60′s and earlier! The world is, despite what you think, a lot better than it was twenty years ago, thirty years ago. You don’t even have to worry about the fucking Ozone layer!You’re not a rebel, because your rebellion ended the moment you found someone who hated the status quo you were born in. I get that this is all new and exciting to you, but to me? Well, I’ll go back to your own standards and point out that you’re a minor, and too fucking young to have anything resembling a perspective.Or to misquote another, ‘You’re not punk, you just shop at Hot Topic’.

                                                                        punkrockpariah

The status quo I was born in is all the rich kids thinking they’re better than me and bullying me for years. The status quo I was born in is the fundemental systemic oppression of minority groups. The status quo I was born into is a country so skewed to the right that they think they can debate who has civil rights. And that the people saying, “all people should be equal.” Are radical leftists? Also quick note: Just cuz things aren’t as bad as they used to be doesn’t mean they’re good. If you used to be on fire but now your drowning, you still have a lot of fucking work to do.I’m not a leftist or a rightie. I’m not Republican nor Democrat. Conservative or liberal. I’m a human being who values human life. The status quo until 4 years ago was gay people legally not being allowed to marry. The status quo is your status quo. Punk didn’t cannibalize itself. It’s ideals of justice, freedom, and equality were ousted from the brief pocket of mainstream it got. And no self respecting punk is a conservative or Republican. You guys stand in direct opposition at the moment to progress and equality. And Trump supporters even less so. Take what I just said and times that by ten. Punk didn’t destroy itself it just kicked you the fuck out. You just didn’t like that all these bands were using their music to convey an important message. All you wanted was to mosh and hurt people. You weren’t and never will be a punk. Nor will you ever understand that punk is about more than picking which color you wanna blindly follow. If I was following the status quo I’d be some alt right shill on 4-Chan. Instead I’m out here fighting for my fellow human because they deserve better. You can talk all the shit you want but a jock still lives inside your head. Again, Joe Strummer, Henry Rollins, Jello Biafra, Fat Mike, Billie Joe Armstrong, Greg Graffin, and Ian MacKaye would all spit in your face. @cookingwithroxy

Hell, you don’t get to call yourself an ally to progress when your reaction to someone criticizing your position is to label them an enemy.You literally don’t know jack shit about the people arguing with you, BECAUSE YOU REFUSE TO LISTEN. You just run along your little well worn ruts, convinced that you’re right as you keep repeating the same lies to yourself that you were told. That you are right, and everyone who disagrees with you is a bigot and a monster.This is why I keep saying your punk isn’t punk, regardless of where you bought in. One, because it’s painfully obvious that your rebellion is only against your particular status quo. Like, literally against your particular status quo, and nothing else.And two, because you know NOTHING about the people you’re arguing with. You instead build up a comfortable nest of lies in your head, and try to fit everyone into the pre-arranged slots you’ve built there. That none of them fit doesn’t matter, because you’re actually incapable of the self-reflection needed to recognize the flaws.So here, at long last, is yet another little bit of ‘my god you’re just an idiot’ for ya. I was never part of the Punk scene. I watched it from the outside. Never moshed. Barely listened to the music. What I listened to were Punks, talking about what was happening to the scene. What the new kids and the rich kids were doing to it.And that’s what makes it embarrassing, that you think I give a single solitary fuck what HENRY ROLLINS of all people would think of me. The man thinks that anger and physical strength is the only thing of value, and you think I’m supposed to be looking to him as some idol?Some day you’ll grow up. Mainly you’ll grow out of the testosterone fug that is your teenage years and stop thinking anger and rage is the way to deal with anyone questioning your views. When that day comes, I’ll still be here, and I’ll still be fighting to fix the problems you’re causing right now.Because I, for one, believe in equality and a brighter future. And you’re still fighting the made up jocks and rich kids inside your head.Oh, and because fuck it I’ve actually got a sassy image appropriate for this and I want to use it?
                                                                        silverscreenx

The lgbt community is not some left leaning political stance (although most people in it are), the community is for those who aren’t cisgender or straight.People already struggle with their sexualities and gender, no need to add anymore bullshit to it.
                                                                        sapphicconservative

There is no political opinion you must have to be in the community. All that is required of you is to not be cisgender and/or straight. Anyone who tries to gatekeep based on politics cannot tolerate sharing a space with someone who thinks differently. Communism is very anti-LGBT+, but I don’t tell communists they aren’t welcome in the community because the community is not inherently political.My sexuality is not political. My community based on my sexuality is not political.To all LGBT+ people who don’t lean left - it’s absolutely okay to walk away from the Democrat party. We are free to form our own political opinions and support the people we want. This isn’t a call to support Republicans, this is a call to support whoever you want and not give in to the hive mind many people try to enforce on the LGBT+ community.
                                                                        punkrockpariah

Because the people in government, mainly Republicans, are making it a political issue. It’s a fucked up shitty thing, but Black people have had to deal with the color of their skin being political forever just the same as we have. The reason why I said that you aren’t welcome into community spaces is because you support beliefs and people that actively harm the community itself. Its like a black personn saying, “yknow… the Klan isn’t that bad when you think about it.” At a BLM march. Or like someone in Ireland saying “I actually really like the Black and Tans and the UDF! The Brits are alright with me!” It doesn’t make sense because its a person who should be a member of the community fighting for freedom and rights, instead supporting those who take those rights away. 
                                                                        sapphicconservative

We are unique individuals united by not being straight and/or cis. Our beliefs and interests will all wildly vary. We can save our politics for other times and instead focus on other aspects. In fact, this is why LGBT+ organizations have popped up to fight for political issues centering around our rights.“Because the people in government, mainly Republicans, are making it a political issue.”Small correction, Democrats are guilty of this just as much. Both frontline their LGBT+ stances and equally push forward issues centering around LGBT+. Sometimes I agree with the Democratic stance and sometimes I agree with the Republican stance here. It all depends on how far either side are taking it.“you support beliefs and people that actively harm the community itself … it doesn’t make sense”Hmm… Instead of calling someone a traitor, I recommend to asking why they believe a certain way. You will never change someone’s mind or convince them otherwise on their beliefs if you insult them. Regardless, I can understand how you’d be confused, and I’m more than willing to clarify my stances.First, what are my beliefs I uphold that harm the community? Is it where I said I treat civil rights and religious freedom equally? Or, is there something new here?Second, I’ve already mentioned that I am more than capable of not supporting a decision and speaking out if it harms the LGBT+ community. While I support most of what Trump pushes forward, I still have a few platforms of his I don’t fully agree with. In fact, when compared to the rest of the candidates, his platform best matches my stances - 3rd parties included. Do you uphold a strict nonsupport towards Joe Biden for all of his racism both new and old?
                                                                        lozfanxv
but Black people have had to deal with the color of their skin being political forever just the same as we have.
Why the fuck did they bring race into this? I don’t remember bringing up Black people, do you remember doing that, Sapphicconservative? How fucking dare you play the minority race card as some way to silence us. What is with the far left and using minorites as playing cards? You do know that there are Black Republicans, right? In fact, one of ten Black Americans identify as Republican. Can’t really blame to be honest, people of the far left only seem to care about them when you try to silence opposing views by using them.But hey, if you really wanna bring up the Black Americans and Democrats, let me give you a history lesson, honey.
June 10, 1964Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen (R-IL) criticized the Democrat filibuster against 1964 Civil Rights Act and called on Democrats to stop opposing racial equality. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was introduced and approved by a majority of Republicans in the Senate. The Act was opposed by most southern Democrat senators, several of whom were proud segregationists — one of them being Al Gore Sr. (D). President Lyndon B. Johnson relied on Illinois Senator Everett Dirksen, the Republican leader from Illinois, to get the Act passed.August 4, 1965Senate Leader Everett Dirksen (R-IL) overcame Democrat attempts to block 1965 Voting Rights Act. Ninety-four percent of Republicans voted for the landmark civil rights legislation while 27% of Democrats opposed. The Voting Rights Act of 1965, abolishing literacy tests and other measures devised by Democrats to prevent blacks from voting, was signed into law. A higher percentage of Republicans voted in favor.February 19, 1976President Gerald Ford formally rescinded President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s notorious Executive Order 9066 authorizing the internment of over 120,000 Japanese-Americans during WWII.September 15, 1981President Ronald Reagan established the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities to increase black participation in federal education programs.June 29, 1982President Ronald Reagan signed a 25-year extension of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.August 10, 1988President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, compensating Japanese-Americans for the deprivation of their civil rights and property during the World War II internment ordered by FDR.November 21, 1991President George H. W. Bush signed the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to strengthen federal civil rights legislation.August 20, 1996A bill authored by U.S. Rep. Susan Molinari (R-NY) to prohibit racial discrimination in adoptions, part of Republicans’ “Contract With America”, became law.July 2, 2010Clinton says Byrd joined KKK to help him get electedJust a “fleeting association”. Nothing to see here.
PS: Lyndon Johnson, after signing the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965, got on an airplane full of governors and told them that after setting those bills in motion, “I’ll have those (N-word) voting Democrat the next 200 years”.
Don’t ever bring up Black Americans again as some sort of gotcha. It makes you look even more like an asshole.
The reason why I said that you aren’t welcome into community spaces is because you support beliefs and people that actively harm the community itself.What about her beliefs makes her dangerous to go into our spaces? I believe that Democrats don’t care for us either. Not only that, but I don’t consider myself Democratic because I don’t agree with many of what they push. Most glaringly they are pro gun control. Something that is a danger to us in the LGBT community, who are targeted by bigots and need something to defend ourselves.

                                                Trump Supporters are all blind cowards too afraid to debate someone or address issues brought up to them cause they have no rebuttal and no defense for their prejudice
                                                                        illvminavt

                                                                        punkrockpariah
                                                                        I’m literally a minor. But yeah no insult the person 12 years younger than you because you have to religiously defend your president you willing let 200,000 people die due to his complete and utter intentional mishandling of the situation. Plus his literal admitting on tape that he knew it was bad. Oh also the fact that he only paid $750 in taxes. 
                                                                        illvminavt

                                                                        punkrockpariah

                                                                        punkrockpariah

                                                                        illvminavt

                                                                        jonnyarmani
Though most LGBTQs vote Democratic, new poll shows 45% of queer men backing Trump
                    Nearly 10 percent of the U.S. queer men who said they "do not support [Trump] at all" said that they will vote for him regardless.                
                Newsweek            Bruh…DOJ seeks data on nursing home deaths in 4 states led by Democrats
                    The governors' actions at the height of the pandemic were designed to ensure hospitals had enough bed space for the most serious COVID cases                
                NBC News            Bruh…Carney: NYT Attack on Trump's 'Financial Acumen' Is Nonsense
                    The Times swings and misses with a contradictory, odd-ball attack on the president based on decades of tax data.                
                Breitbart            Bruh!Oh yeah… i absolutely know it is a Breitbart story but please, after making sure my other two sources can’t be challenged by you, make sure you ignore the tax story because hurr durr right wing news.That would simply show YOUR bias.He gave the treasury department 5.2 million in 2016 and 2017 combined due to the audit he is undergoing so there were no back taxes and then payed $750 ON PAPER while it is ongoing.You can give the federal government all of your money and then use the overage as your tax payment over multiple years until that money runs out. Its better to put it in the bank however and pay what you owe when you owe it.The tax story was just for shock and awe. You fell for it.Bruh.And don’t be a little bitch calling out the ‘minor’ card when you are so punk it shouldn’t matter.
                                                                        punkrockpariah
                                                                        I’m playing the minor card because he wants to talk about a minors sex life. Yknow. Like a creep. Also I’m punk but I’m also Straight Edge. Also you can’t just not pay taxes for 15 years and go, “Oopsie daises! Now that I’m president let me give give you the money now that I’ve collected!” Like that’s not how that works g. Even if he gave 5.2 million he’d still be way short. It’s been over a decade and he’s a scumbag billionaire, yknow like his buddy Jeffery Epstein. And the gay men story? Cool. Outta the number polled 10% said yeah. Lemme take a cool swing at who they polled. White guys. Rich white guys. You know gay men aren’t the only part of the LGBT+ right? And yeah I don’t trust breitbart. They’re extremely biased. I also don’t watch CNN for the same reason. And again yeah I’m punk. Punk enough to put equality and human life over money. And the nursing home deaths? Yeah again I’m telling you. These are large urban areas with dense populations. Of course the virus is gonna spread faster. That’s how that works. You’re telling me that the governor of California had an equally hard time as the governor of Arkansas? 
                                                                        jonnyarmani
                                                                        So you admit it was the States responses and not the president that ‘KILLED 200,000 PEOPLES’You know for certain the demographic polled for the article? Wow… pretty good on ya. I’m certain the polling company has a list of rich white gay men they can call for information… weak take on your part there, BiafraThe tired old Epstein goal post. Keep moving that one buddy but here it is, Trump was the ONLY person willing to come forward and help prosecution towards Epstein in the Florida lawsuit before IT WAS DISMISSED. Sound like good friends.I was explaining the $750 fallacy but GO MOVE THOSE GOALPOSTS. (Thats must be wearing you out)And @illvminavt has no idea your age but you are old enough to stand in this arena and take swings at educated adults you will be treated as an adult.No one cares if you are straight edge.  (Good job on no drugs or alcohol, focus on your school and career - signed Dad.)Now… go to school, ignore the propaganda, and think for YOURSELF. It is very obvious you are in a massive echo chamber.Signed, a previous 80’s punk, liberal democrat anarchist that grew up, had a family, and saw the error in his thinking.P.S. Donald Trump was the first openly supporting president of the gay community. I absolutely can not understand how that is dismissed.
                                                                        punkrockpariah
                                                                        The man isn’t a gay ally. He picked Pence has VPSecondly you weren’t a punk. Cuz punks give a shit about this hurt and needy. Growing up near LA let’s you see what capitalism and mega corps do to the downtrodden. And yeah I’m playing age card when it comes to my sex life. I’d honestly have no trouble literally anywhere else, it just makes y’all sound like pedophiles when you talk about my dick. I think for myself. I don’t wear no hat with a single mans nationalist slogan on it. I don’t fly his flags. I don’t think like I’m in a cult. I’m an anarchist because I believe in morality and equality. You had a family, cracked under the pressure of capitalism and a Jack boot. And instead of realizing that the boot on your neck was bad you decided to roll over and lick it. You ain’t no punk. I swear to fuck man, y’all would get your asses kicked at a gig for this shit. And also. No I didn’t say that the governors were to blame and trump wasn’t. I said they were given an insanely hard task to deal with that was exacerbated by a moron in office who made his entire fan club think it was ok to go around not giving a shit and taking no precautions. 
                                                                        jonnyarmani

(I mean really BRUH… those arms must be really tired by now.)You are just a baby playing dress up. Just because you shop at hot topic and have a shitty attitude doesn’t make you punk. And no one was talking about your dick, thats YOU… and the word pedophile is owned by the left to call out their own. Trump took Corona seriously before any leftist fuck did, including your Govenor. I can pull receipts if you even care.But here it is.I’m done with you. You are shamefully set in your belief and pull the same tactics every little leftie pulls when faced with information. Move the posts and change the subject. Print this thread out and keep it close to your heart. As you grow older and your world views change through maturity you can look back at this and see that you were misled by the very people that you admire and gleam on to.Also, you literally have no idea my expansive history or what I have done in my youth. I was Detroit Punk… we shit on you Hollywood pretenders…Best of luck little man. Learn to open your mind to real discussion and don’t get butt hurt when people swing back at your sad attempts to ‘bash the fash’… lmfao. Oh my God its in his bio.
                                                                        punkrockpariah
                                                                        Fuck off bruh. Detroit. Fucking Huntington Beach and East LA. Bitch ass would get eaten alive on skid row. Get your head caved in Gilman Street. Nose broken at The Smell. And shit stomped in some dudes garage.For the record I ain’t shopping at hot topic. I’m making my own shit. Also Trump has been a wildly unfriendly man when it comes to protecting LGBT+ rights. Supporting senators and members of his cabinet that violently oppress LGBT+ communities around the country. “Trump took it seriously.” Literal audio of him saying he wants to down play it. But you’re gonna run away with your tail tucked between your legs because you’ve met someone who’s lived 3 decades minimum less than you and has much better understanding of compassion for those who have been beaten and oppressed. 
                                                                        jonnyarmani

This isn’t a fight. This is an education for you. I cant help if you refuse to open your mind. Thats why I’m done.Again… your assumptions of me are without any merit. I don’t give a damn if you are gay. I don’t give a damn about anybodies sexuality. But I detest when people make their preferred genitalia their whole persona. Because it is weakness. There is no need to improve one’s self when your whole existence relies on where you stick your junk.Good luck. Hope you find internal peace someday.

                                                                        punkrockpariah

I’m just not a greedy fucking capitalist. Rebellion starts whenever it go damn feels like it. Whether it’s at 12 listening to The Clash in my bedroom or at 17 punching bigots like you in the face. You can “destroy me with facts” (more like half baked opinions based on your bitterness towards the youth) all you want. It doesn’t change the fact that you’re all just posturing. I don’t need a lesson in humility, cuz I understand that I’m always a bad day away from living on the street. Yet I’m still trying my best to stick my neck out for those who need help. You got sad, old, and greedy. Like we get it, you’re back hurts and you’ve got arthritis. Take it out on the system that abandoned you and not turn it on the youth and oppressed to feel powerful. 
                                                                        saltycrackerass

                                                                        the-davest-of-uncles

How dare Gays have a different viewpoint you don’t agree with. So we must be some sort of traitor, right? Never mind the fact that we’re all unique individuals who will see the world in different lights. You’ve reduced us strictly down to our sexuality. Which is just what my homophobic family does, as well.Rather than tossing insults around like a child throwing a tantrum, maybe you should listen to your own words and actually be open for discussions next time.If you want a debate, I’m open to it.
                                                                        punkrockpariah
                                                                        Bruh. Cmon. I’ve been debating people for legit a full day. By myself, on different threads. Also yeah. No you are a traitor actually. In the GOPs actual agenda it says the wanna reverse the decision to make it illegal to refuse to provide goods or services based on sexuality. I’m tossing insults as well cuz you can only take so many, “communist faggots” before you start slinging back. Now you can give your piece but it’s like ghost voting for the ghostbusters. 
                                                                        sapphicconservative
                                                                        While I don’t support name calling to any regard, you didn’t help yourself any with this matter at all. You started off by calling your opponents strong words, so of course they’re going to retaliate with strong words. I’ve been in similar positions as you. I’ve had upwards of 100 people send me anon hate from graphic to vague descriptions in the span of a few hours. You being flustered is understandable, but please try to keep your head high or you’ll give them more ammo as to why non-Trump supporters are worse.“I’ve been debating people for legit a full day.”Then, I suppose that revokes your original claim about Trump supporters. Regardless, I was more so talking about a debate whenever you want, not necessarily now or on this post. So long as debates remain civil, I’m open to them.“No you are a traitor actually.”Then I stand by my original claim. You are homophobic for thinking all LGBT+ people have to think a certain way or we’re some traitor. My sexuality does not determine my political beliefs, and vice versa. Furthermore, do you really think I wouldn’t speak out against homophobia when I see it?I’ve been part of the conservative community for almost a full decade and I can assure you that the average conservative doesn’t care who you love so long as you don’t make it your sole personality trait. The worst homophobia I’ve received has all been from the left when they realize I’m a “traitor”. They were the ones to constantly hurl death and rape threats at me.“In the GOPs actual agenda it says it wants the wanna reverse the decision to make it illegal to refuse to provide good or services based on sexuality.”Sources needed, but I think I know what you’re talking about. This is a case of finding a balance between religious and civil liberties to make sure both are equally protected. Reforming the law on sexuality a bit would greatly protect our religious liberties. We can still be married and such, but people should have the right to determine if they want to participate in something that violates their religion. A muslim or Christian should have the right to say they aren’t going to bake a cake for a same sex marriage. If there was a religion for it, a same sex couple should be able to turn away a straight couple for similar reasons.“I’m tossing insults as well cuz you can only take so many, “communist f*ggots” before you start slinging back.“And again, you started off with calling others insults. Them retaliating with insults shouldn’t be such a shocking revelation to you. That, and I wasn’t really rude to you. I pointed out how your message came off homophobic, and you were the one who retaliated with vitriol. So, your excuse is rather weak. Unfortunately, you gave many people exactly what they wanted.
                                                                        punkrockpariah
                                                                        No no no. You’re a lesbian sure. That’s a fact. But you are t welcome in LGBT+ spaces because again the GOP is a threat. They have a 67 page agenda and on page 19 it says the wanna reverse the decision protecting same sex couples from discrimination. It not only allows people to refuse them service cuz they’re religious, but also because they just don’t like gays. That’s discrimination and homophobic. You’re homophobic for supporting Trump and Pence. Pence especially, a violent homophobe who caused an aids crisis in Indiana and supporters conversion camps. Second off NO! No one should be allowed to discriminate based off anything! Religion or otherwise it’s homophobia and it’s not ok! If your religion doesn’t support gays your religion is shit! You think I haven’t gotten death threats? You’re insanely naive if you think I think people should think the same. I just think that you supporting some who directly harms the group the you care oh so much about, makes you… now what’s the word? Oh right! A fucking traitor! After all the progress for LGBT+ rights, hard fought change, you turned your back on those who paved the path in their own blood so you could have rights, and then you supported the people they fought so hard against. 
                                                                        sapphicconservative
                                                                        “But you are t welcome in LGBT+ spaces”I’m sorry, but that’s not for you to decide on. The LGBT+ community is solely a community connected by not being cisgender or heterosexual. You can’t exclude people you don’t like from being in the community. Might as well rename the LGBT+ community to a branch of left-wing politics at this rate. Ironically, I feel much more welcomed in conservative spaces.“They have a 67 page agenda and on page 19 it says the wanna reverse the decision protecting same sex couples from discrimination.”Again, source needed. If it is what I think it is, then I politely disagree. Religious freedom and civil liberties are both important and we need to find a balance to best protect both. Also, I’m an atheist but I’m not anti-religion. In most religions, same sex relationships are frowned upon because they believe you should only have sex to reproduce. In some religions, it is a bond between you, your partner, and your religion’s god.I know a good amount of religious folks who support LGBT+ people but would prefer if they didn’t provide services that would go against their religion. I.e. baking a cake makes them a participant in a marriage going against their religion. The government has no authority to decide what people can and can’t do with their private businesses. That’s too authoritarian for me.“Pence especially, a violent homophobe who caused the an aids crisis in Indiana and supporters conversion camps.”I have no comment on the aids crisis, but he supports willing conversion therapy from what I read. He’s never stated supporting electric shock therapy. I don’t like using Snopes, but it goes over it well enough, surprisingly. Source. There’s a distinct difference between supporting forced conversion therapy and wanting that option to be held open for others to willingly have. It’s much less malicious on his end.In fact, he actually willingly participated in conversion therapy, which explains why he holds the stance on keeping it open for willing people to use. Source.“You think I haven’t gotten death threats?”No, I mentioned I’ve been in a similar position as you and have an understanding of the stress and such you feel with this post. Knowing how Tumblr can be with discourse of any kind, I’d be surprised if you didn’t receive death threats from this post, unfortunately.“You’re insanely naive if you think I think people should think the same.”But, you have an issue with LGBT+ people supporting people you don’t like? Calling us traitors. What other conclusion should I come to? I’m free to see information and form my own opinion. I’m free to weigh up my priorities and vote for people who will vote for the issues I want to see handled. I rank both religious freedom and civil liberties equally in what I want protected. You rank civil liberties way above religious freedom. There’s nothing inherently wrong with either.“you supported the people they fought so hard against.”No offense, but you’re infantilizing me here if you really believe I won’t speak out against homophobic stances. If I see it and truly believe that is homophobia, then I speak against it. I haven’t turned my back against anyone, but the LGBT+ community has turned their back on me because they see my stances at a surface level and refuse to hear me out. Instead, they call me a traitor and accuse me of being fake or an old man because they can’t fathom someone goes against their narrative.

It’s obvious that OP’s been told to hate along with having been told what to believe, and because of that they feed every negative response into the justification to hate, treating death threats and calm rebuttal with the same level of vitreol. Because that’s all they have.And that’s without me commenting on ANY teen claiming to be punk. I mean fuck, there’s a reason why the phrase is ‘Punk is dead, and Punk killed it.’
                                                                        punkrockpariah

Have you ever considered you were spoon fed your beliefs as well and that’s literally how the world works whether your a isolated farmer from Siberia or a barista in a Starbucks. You were fed you rhetoric. I bucked the rhetoric that I was fed. I get yelled at irl a lot for being too extreme. And what happened to me is I was born into a time period where the government was and still is in the Middle East for no fucking reason. Where people knew that climate change is real and ignore it anyways. Where civil rights are tossed to the wayside daily and no one says a word. If you’re not angry you haven’t been paying attention
                                                                        cookingwithroxy

Like, I really do not expect actual sentience out of you for another fifteen years most likely, even at best I wouldn’t consider you possible of full cognitive ability for at least another seven. And I’ve read your posts, you buck NOTHING. You maybe shed the party line of where you started, but you only rebelled long enough to find a different party line to hew right to and repeat verbatim as people point out the flaws in your arguments.I mean fuck, everyone was born to a time of trials and wars in the middle east, that’s pretty much standard. AND Climate panic, that’s been going on since the 60′s and earlier! The world is, despite what you think, a lot better than it was twenty years ago, thirty years ago. You don’t even have to worry about the fucking Ozone layer!You’re not a rebel, because your rebellion ended the moment you found someone who hated the status quo you were born in. I get that this is all new and exciting to you, but to me? Well, I’ll go back to your own standards and point out that you’re a minor, and too fucking young to have anything resembling a perspective.Or to misquote another, ‘You’re not punk, you just shop at Hot Topic’.
                                                                        takashi0

                                                                        punkrockpariah

The status quo I was born in is all the rich kids thinking they’re better than me and bullying me for years. The status quo I was born in is the fundemental systemic oppression of minority groups. The status quo I was born into is a country so skewed to the right that they think they can debate who has civil rights. And that the people saying, “all people should be equal.” Are radical leftists? Also quick note: Just cuz things aren’t as bad as they used to be doesn’t mean they’re good. If you used to be on fire but now your drowning, you still have a lot of fucking work to do.I’m not a leftist or a rightie. I’m not Republican nor Democrat. Conservative or liberal. I’m a human being who values human life. The status quo until 4 years ago was gay people legally not being allowed to marry. The status quo is your status quo. Punk didn’t cannibalize itself. It’s ideals of justice, freedom, and equality were ousted from the brief pocket of mainstream it got. And no self respecting punk is a conservative or Republican. You guys stand in direct opposition at the moment to progress and equality. And Trump supporters even less so. Take what I just said and times that by ten. Punk didn’t destroy itself it just kicked you the fuck out. You just didn’t like that all these bands were using their music to convey an important message. All you wanted was to mosh and hurt people. You weren’t and never will be a punk. Nor will you ever understand that punk is about more than picking which color you wanna blindly follow. If I was following the status quo I’d be some alt right shill on 4-Chan. Instead I’m out here fighting for my fellow human because they deserve better. You can talk all the shit you want but a jock still lives inside your head. Again, Joe Strummer, Henry Rollins, Jello Biafra, Fat Mike, Billie Joe Armstrong, Greg Graffin, and Ian MacKaye would all spit in your face. @cookingwithroxy

Hell, you don’t get to call yourself an ally to progress when your reaction to someone criticizing your position is to label them an enemy.You literally don’t know jack shit about the people arguing with you, BECAUSE YOU REFUSE TO LISTEN. You just run along your little well worn ruts, convinced that you’re right as you keep repeating the same lies to yourself that you were told. That you are right, and everyone who disagrees with you is a bigot and a monster.This is why I keep saying your punk isn’t punk, regardless of where you bought in. One, because it’s painfully obvious that your rebellion is only against your particular status quo. Like, literally against your particular status quo, and nothing else.And two, because you know NOTHING about the people you’re arguing with. You instead build up a comfortable nest of lies in your head, and try to fit everyone into the pre-arranged slots you’ve built there. That none of them fit doesn’t matter, because you’re actually incapable of the self-reflection needed to recognize the flaws.So here, at long last, is yet another little bit of ‘my god you’re just an idiot’ for ya. I was never part of the Punk scene. I watched it from the outside. Never moshed. Barely listened to the music. What I listened to were Punks, talking about what was happening to the scene. What the new kids and the rich kids were doing to it.And that’s what makes it embarrassing, that you think I give a single solitary fuck what HENRY ROLLINS of all people would think of me. The man thinks that anger and physical strength is the only thing of value, and you think I’m supposed to be looking to him as some idol?Some day you’ll grow up. Mainly you’ll grow out of the testosterone fug that is your teenage years and stop thinking anger and rage is the way to deal with anyone questioning your views. When that day comes, I’ll still be here, and I’ll still be fighting to fix the problems you’re causing right now.Because I, for one, believe in equality and a brighter future. And you’re still fighting the made up jocks and rich kids inside your head.Oh, and because fuck it I’ve actually got a sassy image appropriate for this and I want to use it?
                                                                        silverscreenx

                                                                        lozfanxv

The lgbt community is not some left leaning political stance (although most people in it are), the community is for those who aren’t cisgender or straight.People already struggle with their sexualities and gender, no need to add anymore bullshit to it.
                                                                        sapphicconservative
                                                                        “the community is for those who aren’t cisgender or straight.”Exactly. There is no political opinion you must have to be in the community. All that is required of you is to not be cisgender and/or straight. Anyone who tries to gatekeep based on politics cannot tolerate sharing a space with someone who thinks differently. Communism is very anti-LGBT+, but I don’t tell communists they aren’t welcome in the community because the community is not inherently political.My sexuality is not political. My community based on my sexuality is not political.To all LGBT+ people who don’t lean left - it’s absolutely okay to walk away from the Democrat party. We are free to form our own political opinions and support the people we want. This isn’t a call to support Republicans, this is a call to support whoever you want and not give in to the hive mind many people try to enforce on the LGBT+ community.
                                                                        punkrockpariah
                                                                        Sorry about your migraine, but you got something wrong.At the moment it is political. Because the people in government, mainly Republicans, are making it a political issue. It’s a fucked up shitty thing, but Black people have had to deal with the color of their skin being political forever just the same as we have. The reason why I said that you aren’t welcome into community spaces is because you support beliefs and people that actively harm the community itself. Its like a black personn saying, “yknow… the Klan isn’t that bad when you think about it.” At a BLM march. Or like someone in Ireland saying “I actually really like the Black and Tans and the UDF! The Brits are alright with me!” It doesn’t make sense because its a person who should be a member of the community fighting for freedom and rights, instead supporting those who take those rights away. 
                                                                        sapphicconservative
                                                                        “At the moment it is political.”Politics does not need to enter a community centered around sexualities and gender identity. We are unique individuals united by not being straight and/or cis. Our beliefs and interests will all wildly vary. We can save our politics for other times and instead focus on other aspects. In fact, this is why LGBT+ organizations have popped up to fight for political issues centering around our rights.“Because the people in government, mainly Republicans, are making it a political issue.”Small correction, Democrats are guilty of this just as much. Both frontline their LGBT+ stances and equally push forward issues centering around LGBT+. Sometimes I agree with the Democratic stance and sometimes I agree with the Republican stance here. It all depends on how far either side are taking it.“you support beliefs and people that actively harm the community itself … it doesn’t make sense”Hmm… Instead of calling someone a traitor, I recommend to asking why they believe a certain way. You will never change someone’s mind or convince them otherwise on their beliefs if you insult them. Regardless, I can understand how you’d be confused, and I’m more than willing to clarify my stances.First, what are my beliefs I uphold that harm the community? Is it where I said I treat civil rights and religious freedom equally? Or, is there something new here?Second, I’ve already mentioned that I am more than capable of not supporting a decision and speaking out if it harms the LGBT+ community. While I support most of what Trump pushes forward, I still have a few platforms of his I don’t fully agree with. In fact, when compared to the rest of the candidates, his platform best matches my stances - 3rd parties included. Do you uphold a strict nonsupport towards Joe Biden for all of his racism both new and old?
                                                                        punkrockpariah
                                                                        I hate Biden so much. I just hate Trump more. Both are racist, but Trump more so and more actively pushes a dividing line between races. So yes I’m anti Biden but if you have to pick between two enemies pick the one you know. Not the unpredictable hot head. The belief that are dangerous are that you support Trump in general because he’s an immediate threat to our rights. And also that a GOP led gov won’t attack our civil rights. Especially with Barrett in the Supreme Court. Not only is Row V Wade at risk but also the roll back of anti discrimination laws. This would allow a lot of bad shit. Gays being turned away by medical facilities, restaurants, venues, and services otherwise. Which is flat out a violation of civil rights. Don’t care what religion you believe in. Even if it’s anti-LGBT+, which makes a shit religion, it cannot be used as an excuse for legal violation of civil rights. Not only that but if you think conversion camps are used only on the willing you’re naive. Plus it’d be easier to pass the bill that Trump Administration tried to pass awhile ago that would also allow doctors of any kind to refuse service to people based on the, being Trans. Already since Trump took office, hate crimes against every minority group have steadily been rising. Hate groups feel more comfortable being hateful when the president supports their views. I’m gonna have to reblog my own post with links because it keeps crashing when I try to go grab the links.
