jimmickwatersmithI feel lonely. It's never a great way to feel. It's such a boring feeling. I want it to be the future, where things have already happened and things are different. It'll probably be better then because I'll have snapped out of this mess. I'll be smarter then. I'm so dumb now. Look at these sentences. Look at how short and dumb they are. Dumb, dumb, dumb. And fucking boring.I can't believe I was ever confident in myself. I had a dream of two sky-writing planes crash landing into Lake Michigan; it was spectacular. And a few nights later, I had a dream about a lobster-sized scorpion that was equal parts terrifying and annoying.Anyway, how's everyone else doing?
