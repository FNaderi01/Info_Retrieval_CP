    Summary
      With Reginald long dead, the Hargreeves Family thought that everything that surrounds them that includes Reginald's secrets would be buried with him in the grave. They didn't really think just how secretive Reginald has been with them, and a secret that includes a powerful enemy from the past that will hunt them in the current present day, with a simple goal to get what Reginald has promised him in the first place.

Except for Five of course. His overactive brain was like a child who had no toys to play with, or in his case, no impending world demise to stop.orFive is bored and finds himself investigating a string of kidnappings...

    Summary
      On October 1st, 1989 43 women gave birth, the strange thing being that none of these women had been pregnant when the day began. Reginald Hargreeves acquired seven of them.
These children were born with extraordinary abilities, super strength, directional manipulation, mind control, the ability to commune with the dead, time travel, a dimensional portal to a tentacled beast, and the power to turn sound into a weapon.
They would encounter others with talents similar to their own, and this would lead to a realization. 43 women had given birth and they had encountered 14 people, including themselves, that were like them. So, statistically speaking there were at least 29 others. 
For a certain time traveling assassin this means at least 29 potential points for a new apocalypse to occur, and  Five Hargreeves is not one to let any variable go unchecked.

    Summary
      Just a bunch of Five-centric Umbrella Academy one-shots. I assure you that everyone else will be in it too though.In this, Five is a legitimate thirteen year-old. He has still been through the apocalypse and everything else, he still knows how to snap someone's neck in one swift movement, he's just younger.Triggers will be at the top of the page so make sure to read the info there.I don't have a updating scheme, but I think there will be at least one by the end of the week.I love feedback and I'm up for constructive criticism!You can leave requests in the comments if you want to suggest something (no smut or reader inserts though).
