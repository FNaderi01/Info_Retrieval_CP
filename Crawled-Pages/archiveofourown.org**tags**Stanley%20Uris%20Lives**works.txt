    Summary
      “Boys don’t wear woman clothing or makeup, Richie! Only females and maybe diseased men.” She tells him, a disgusted look on her face.“Diseased men?” He asks her when she removes the cloth from his mouth to rinse and wet it anew.“You know faggots and fairies,” she lowers her voice, “men that like men. Romantically.”
Richie was eight when he first wore a skirt. It didnt go so well.

    Summary
      My work for the fall 2020 gift exchange After the Ritual of Chüd had failed everything went by so fast. It had turned into some sort of giant fucking lovecraftian spider creature, so in response Richie had done the only thing he could think to do; he grabbed Eddie and fucking ran. Richie pulled him somewhere he thought would be out of sight, they ended up behind a small outcropping watching as It ran by and tried desperately to claw its way towards at least one of their scattering friends.Or in which Richie saves Eddie.

    Summary
      “You already know what I’m going to say to you. It hasn’t changed since that day under the bleachers. I was right then, and I’m right now,” Bev told him. He could hear her typing on a computer and knew she must be in her office.
“You’ve always been right. That doesn’t mean I’ve been ready to listen,” Richie replied softly. “I can’t tell him, Bevvie. I know it’s hurting me, but telling him would hurt him more. He’s happily married, and I’m…”
“If you finish that with anything disparaging, I will fly over there and castrate you myself,” she told him. He could hear the smile in her voice.

    Summary
      "Everyone thinks we're a fairytale. But they're wrong. There's always been witches in the world. There's magic all around us. And magic users can harness it, and do things you'd only imagine in your wildest dreams. It's a life I'd never trade... but witches aren't the only myths that are real."Stan was listening, understanding, and that's what I needed. He asked, "What else is real?""Fairies, demons, nymphs, mermaids-""Vampires?"I laughed, the first real laugh since the Losers Club split, "No. No vampires or werewolves. And the clown, he's something else entirely. I've never seen anything like him before. An Eldritch who likes illusions.""What did you see?" He was referring to my fear. I could tell him now, he knew everything."Our history. What they did to the people they suspected knew magic. They... you, screamed at me.""What did we scream?"My answer came out in a whisper. I could still hear it. It was burned into my brain, constantly replaying in my ears, "Burn the witch."

    Summary
  Richie couldn’t speak for the others, but he was about two seconds from a nervous break at any given time. Pile on the flood of memories, the trauma from both the clown and the hometown bullies, talking to cops when all he wanted to do was stare at Eddie’s face, the constant worry for his best friend’s health… Richie was straight-up not having a good time.
My take on a fix-it. Ft. Losers Hospital Sleepover Party Extravaganza, Losers Club Cuddle Piles, And They Were Roommates (Oh My God They Were Roommates), and The Inherent Homoeroticism of Applying Each Other's Sunscreen.

    Summary
      Eddie and Stan live because it’s my fic and I say so.
Eddie doesn’t get stabbed in the sewers. He leaves Derry with Richie to go hide out in LA, avoiding Myra until the divorce papers hit the system. Living with Richie resurfaces so childhood memories, forcing Eddie to realize that everything he’s believed about himself for the past 27 years has been a lie.
It’s domestic fluff with a slow burn that's about the y e a r n i n g and the self-discovery. Not exactly a songfic but heavily based on songs found in chapter notes.

    Summary
      It takes a village to raise a baby. For an adult regressing to a baby, however, it takes a Losers Club.With Richie going on a five day business trip, the group has declared it the perfect opportunity to meet little Eddie. For one day and night each, Mike, Stan, Bill, Ben, and Bev will all get an opportunity to "babysit" a regressed Eddie. Eddie, having never taken such a massive step without Richie, is fearful. Taking place over the course of one week, these seven chapters will follow little Eddie throughout this experience.Perhaps this experience is just what Eddie needs to learn to trust his friends, and maybe even himself, among other lessons.
