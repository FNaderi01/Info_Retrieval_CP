    Summary
      Perseus Jackson is caught in an arranged marriage to secure his family's flourishing fishing business. He is apprehensive about the arrangement, but he tries his best to respect his family's wishes. That is, until he messes up the whole rehearsal and makes a fool of himself. Curse his poor memory. While wandering in the woods, he finally gets his vows right...and accidentally marries the corpse of a seventeen-year-old boy who was buried in an unmarked grave beneath his feet. He is plunged into a strange world that exists below the surface, suddenly married to the corpse and far away from everything he ever knew. However, he soon learns that the land of the dead is much livelier than the one up above, and the corpse he married is actually not too bad, either...

      Giorno thought he killed Risotto, back then. He didn't make sure, though. He may pay for that oversight with his life. A long piece for Whumptober 2020, containing most of the prompts in one form or another, just all written as one singular big fic instead of a bunch of little seperate ones, and not in prompt order. Sequel to my Kinktober 2019's "Knifeplay" ficlet and set in Miracleverse.

    Summary
      Midoriya is a detective fresh out of the police academy when he gets his first job at the Musutafu Detective Agency or the MDA for short. His first day is going pretty well until Chief Detective Iida lets Midoriya in on a new criminal organization that had appeared about a year ago within the city. Iida warns him, telling him to be on the look out for the gang leader Todoroki Shoto and his right hand man Bakugo Katsuki. Over the next few weeks Midoriya starts to suspect that someone is following him around and Uraraka offers to walk him home one night to help calm his nerves. After she leaves Midoriya is left alone in his apartment, or so he thinks. Why had Todoroki's organization never been caught? Who is the person following Midoriya around and what do they want? What is the MDA hiding? Will Midoriya be able to figure out what's really going on?
