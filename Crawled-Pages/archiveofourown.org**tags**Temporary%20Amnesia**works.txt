    Summary
      Jaskier looks into the mirror. Julian of Cintra stares back at him, and there is almost nothing of Jaskier in that reflection. Gone is the bard who’d wowed the Continent with his songs, and Jaskier grieves for the loss, heart heavy and aching. He’d managed to discover what he would have been had he not been a witcher, but he will never have it again. Returning to the Path will be painful, knowing that he will once again be rejected by humans, and it leaves a hollowness in Jaskier as he realises that he will no longer be loved. Not anymore.*Before Jaskier the bard was born, there was Julian of Cintra, a witcher tired of his life on the Path. Julian gets the life he wants and lives four decades as Jaskier, until he’s forced to return to his life as Julian after the dragon hunt.As he struggles to reconcile his two identities, Julian finds Geralt and Ciri, and slowly lets himself trust again.

    Summary
      The Academy is for vampires. When Jeongguk wakes up, he is human and with no recollection of where he is or why he’s there — why there is an unbearable pain in his neck, and why the boy with obsidian hair and even darker eyes keeps a watchful eye over him.

    Summary
      Coughing, Damian knelt and tried to stand up to no avail. He couldn’t stay here. Mara left to leave a decoy trail for whoever might try to follow him. If he stayed long, he’d be found out even with the decoy trail and all of Mara’s efforts will be for naught. Falling back to the ground, he kept his breathing to a minimum to lessen the pain he felt. He needed to live. He wanted to live.~~AU in which Damian loses his memories and gets pseudo-adopted by the Dupain-Chengs.

    Summary
      From the Devil’s demons, your ancestors sought out salvation and protection. God sent his angels to the land and granted their wish. And yet the humans were still unsatisfied. Mercy, they cried. ‘Mercy’ – a term coined by neither God nor Devil. Traitors, these humans were. They wanted neither the rule of Devil nor God, who gave them everything. And even knowing that, will you continue to stand behind your kingdom of rebels during these times of war,
Leo Tsukinaga, King of Terra?

    Summary
      Shinjiro wakes up from a four-month-long coma with memories that stop being entirely coherent at the tail-end of middle school. This is, obviously, not an ideal situation to be in, but he doesn't exactly have a lot of options for fixing it.
The one possibility he does see involves a cheerful girl with a bright smile, and honestly, that just brings up even more questions.
Thankfully, she seems more than willing to answer them.

      Jiang Cheng plans his end. He succeeds. Or so he thinks.Wanyin wakes up after some extremely needed sleep (God he's going to kill Xian-Ge for challenging him to drink that last jar of Emperor's Smile - his head is pounding), only to find a pair of amber eyes, staring down at him wide eyed and stunned. The eyes are attached to a face. And gosh, does that face take his breath away. But why does he look so despondent? Hmm, he looks awfully familiar.Wait, what is he thinking! Why is this stranger in his room, staring at him like he's the Ghost of Christmas Past??!!?"THE FUCK YOU LOOKING AT PERVERT," is the rallying cry he manages, before throwing himself at that man. Only to pass right through him and fall face first onto the hardwood floor of his bedroom.Ah, FUCK!

    Summary
      The story is complete, I'll update on Friday's ;)It’s been eleven years since Armageddon and Heaven and Hell have been conspiring to restart it. Meanwhile Aziraphale and Crowley moved in together, got married, and worked through their traumas. When their former bosses finally confront them, they attack with an object that will take centuries worth of memories from the ineffable pair. But something goes a little wrong in the process… Crowley takes the full hit.
(Basically, it’s just about +30,000 words worth of Crowley being a confused mess at why Aziraphale’s finally reciprocating his love)

      She found herself alone, dark, and confused. She couldn’t remember anything. She felt trapped. Her ears twitched, and she heard it. She needed to get out. Now.

    Summary
      A surprise encounter with a hostile species leaves Trip with amnesia and Malcolm pronounced KIA. However, when Trip wakes up from a three week coma, the first thing he sees is his friend. A ghost? A hallucination? Not even Malcolm himself knows why he's still there, or why only Trip can see him. The answer may be in the initial sudden alien attack but to pursue it is a dangerous path for everyone.

    Summary
  If the workday is bad, the walk home is even worse. Tonight, the Coruscanti-populace seems to be particularly boisterous. Ben slips into the middle of the street to avoid the queues for innumerable clubs and pulls his dark jacket closer to hide his oil-stained shirt. His legs ache from crouching in the blasted ion tank all day. 
  He glances left, side-stepping an inebriated Togruta and sees her. Dark hair and a slight frame, slipping between the crowds. 
  The woman. The one he sees every night when he closes his eyes. Soothing, searching, scorching through him.
[OR]Ben's nightmares are starting to affect his work - though he's never been much of a mechanic anyway. What if he's meant to be somewhere else - doing something greater? But then he wouldn't have Anakin. When Ben catches sight of something in the street, it seems like his dreams have come alive to haunt him, until an incident in front of the old Temple teaches him that he has no idea who he really is.This is an AU inspired by the Total Recall remake (2012) in which memory schenanigans ensue.

    Summary
      Borrowing elements from the cartoon episode, "A Glitch In Time" and set exactly 5 years, 3 months and 23 days after the events of "Another Way", Sam and Max have been having quite the busy life - especially now that they're supernatural abominations to nature! However, when an incident involving time travel leaves Max in a terrible facility and Sam with amnesia, they are once again thrown into an odd adventure that will take their life in a new direction that they'd least expected.(Special credit to calliepeepers for co-writing the AU &amp; beta reading!!)
