Paul Quinn College Extends Scholarships to 55 California Students            
				By Troy Tieuel Contributing Writer                
	                	                Published July 29, 2015
		Nicole Ford (center, standing) poses with a few prospective Paul Quinn students.
The students owe their educational futures to Paul Quinn recruiting specialist Nicole Ford, who used her influence as a Black College Tour guide for her company Stepping in the Right Direction to secure both placement and scholarships for them.
“I got hired at Paul Quinn, because I recruit students for my Black College Tours,” explained Ford.
“I take over three-hundred students per year to visit black colleges. So, I consider myself an expert on Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Because I love Paul Quinn so much, and I came from a smaller school, the first college that I went to was a black college called Talladega College; I realized that small schools are great for some students. I find that our students, coming from Southern California, small schools are better for us.”
Recruiting Specialist Nicole Fords explains financial aid and registration information to a parent of a student heading to Paul Quinn College in the fall.
The students, who didn’t go to Summer Bridge currently in session at Quinn’s Texas campus, gathered together in Altadena to go over important details and to clear up any misconceptions about Paul Quinn’s requirements and campus life.

“We are looking forward to playing a role in what is going to become an amazing life,” said President Michael J. Sorrell in a taped message. “As you are getting prepared to make that trek east, we just want to say, ‘Get here as quickly as you can. We miss you already. We’re excited to see you, and we’ll see you in a few weeks.’”
A reception held recently was to inform the California based students about the school and for them to get to know one another. About twenty of the perspective students were in attendance.
“[Attending Paul Quinn College] will benefit me because this type of school prepares us for the world, as far as having a job and dressing professionally,” said RaeLisha Frank, who is planning to register this August as a nursing major.
Taylor Bell, a student from Lakewood High, looks forward to going to college in August.
“I always wanted to go to a Historically Black College or University,” said Bell, who plans on majoring in Business, “and this is a small school and it’s cheap. I am basically going for free. I also feel like Texas is a cool place to live and start a new, fresh start.”
According to its website, Paul Quinn College is a private, historically black college (HBCU) located south of downtown Dallas, Texas. The college is associated with the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Being one of the oldest colleges west of the Mississippi, Paul Quinn College was founded in 1872 in Austin, Texas by a small group of African Methodist Episcopal preachers at Metropolitan A.M.E. Church. The College relocated to southeast Dallas, Texas in 1990 after it acquired the former campus of Bishop College. Paul Quinn College has about 200 students currently enrolled.
Paul Quinn College offers a traditional liberal arts education with majors that include education, theology, Business Administration, and engineering. For more information on Paul Quinn College, go to http://www.pqc.edu/.
