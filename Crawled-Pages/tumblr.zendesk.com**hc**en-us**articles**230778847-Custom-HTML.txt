          Editing your custom HTML
To edit your blog theme's HTML: 
Click "Settings" under the account menu at the top of the dashboard.
Choose the blog you’d like to update on the right side of the page, then click “Edit theme” in the Website Theme section.
Click the Edit HTML button and edit the custom HTML as desired in the source code editor. To see the changes reflected on the page, click “Update Preview.”
When you're finished, click the back arrow and then click "Save."
We’ve also got a brilliant guide to making custom Tumblr themes right here.
Pro tip: You can revert to an earlier version of your theme's custom HTML (you know, if you’re feeling nostalgic about an old version). We store recent versions of your Custom HTML on our Theme Recovery page. If you don’t see the version you want, it might be too many revisions back. This means it’s gone forever.
Troubleshooting
If your blog looks a little wrecked or is totally blank, it’s possible that you’ve inserted incorrect code into your theme or blog description. Try the following:
Remove all code from the description box at the top of your Customize menu. Click "Save," then view your blog to see if the problem is resolved.
Save a copy of your custom HTML, then re-install the theme from www.tumblr.com/themes.
Tips:
Clear your browser cache between changes to make sure you're seeing a current version of your blog. The easiest way is to hit Cmd+Shift+R on a Mac or Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows, which will completely refresh the page.
If you can't view the Customize button on your blog, you can still access the Customize menu in several other ways.
We won’t be able to help you figure out broken code in any real detail, but whatever your problem is, someone else has probably had it before. Don’t hesitate to search the internet or consult a savvy friend.
Never use any code from a source you don’t know and trust. Better yet, never use any code that you don't fully understand. Bad code can break your whole blog or force you to reset your password if our system detects something really insecure.
Our staff can’t help with HTML/CSS customizations, but if you need help you can ask a friend or brush up your skills. And if that fails, you can always use one of the other zillions of themes at www.tumblr.com/themes.
