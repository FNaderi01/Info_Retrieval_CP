    Summary
      A broken man and a broken soul identified as 'No Longer Human', treated the same way by many. Just who is Dazai Osamu. My view of who Dazai Osamu is. I just like thinking about who a character is as a person and like to understand their personalities. I would love to hear what others have to say about him. I can very much be missing pieces and be wrong about something, I would appreciate corrections

    Summary
      Una misión…Un nuevo poder…¿Qué puede salir mal?Eso fue lo que pensó Nakahara Chuuya uno de los ejecutivos de la Port Mafia, sus misiones si bien siempre implican un gran riesgo nunca fueron problema para él, todo debido a su inmenso poder, hasta que un pequeño error, un descuido cambio totalmente su mundo.Esto no es real…No me puede pasar a mi…Esas palabras rondaban su mente una y otra vez, que hacer en una situación así, solo tenia una oportunidad de solucionar todo, solo una esperanza; pero eso implica dejar su orgullo atrás, buscar a aquel que lo dejo sin mirar atrás, sin importarle sus sentimientos, su dolor.Él debe solucionarlo, su poder no tiene excepciones… Y también tiene complicaciones…

    Summary
      "Hm, I don't know how to describe him. Mischievous? Mad? Difficult maybe? Ah no, that's not right." He stands up and walks closer to the man sitting on the opposite side of the table. "Devilish." When broke college student Nakahara Chuuya makes a deal with vampire Dazai Osamu, his blood in exchange for a good living space and food, he realises that Dazai may not only be a vampire — he might be the devil himself.

    Summary
      “Atsuuuushi-kuun~, do you think our fear of insects comes from the fact that when we look at them all we see are their bare bones?”“Um, well-““That, when we see them, we see a skeleton walking around, flaunting the reality of our own mortality before us in a gaudy parade,”“Excuse m—““YOUR bones are about to be flaunted before you in a gaudy parade if you don’t shut the HELL UP” --Under a precarious truce, three Armed Detectives and two Port Mafiosi have augmented a mountain cave into a makeshift base of operations for their mission in the remote nation of NGL, where the new and highly dangerous Chimera Ant species are running rampant. The queen’s offspring take on the characteristics of whatever she eats. She has recently taken to eating humans, rendering her colony one capable of ant-like instincts with human-like reason.The queen’s top royal guard has a plan for Dazai. And he just can’t resist a good game.—-Knowledge of HxH and chimera ants NOT required!!!

And I'm damn good at my job. But it's not my job to forgive you for what you did to me, so I won't. Not now, not ever. Do you understand?"
