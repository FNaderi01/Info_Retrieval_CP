 November Teacher Resource 
Guide
Along with March, November is one of the two windiest months in the northern 
hemisphere. In many ways, this is because November is the mirror image of 
March - that is, the same weather patterns are causing all the wind, except 
in reverse. In March, strong high pressure areas from the south are jostling 
with strong low pressure areas from the north, pushing them out as winter 
gives way to Spring. In November, autumn is being pushed out by winter, 
and the same situation occurs, except that this time, the warm high pressure 
areas are in retreat, and bitter winds are gushing in from the north.
There is nothing like a bit of fur to help keep off the cold, and in parts 
of the United States, and much of Australia and New Zealand, as well as 
Canada, Ireland, England, and Spain, November is one of the hairiest months 
in the calendar. This is because there is a movement for men to grow moustaches 
and, sometimes, beards for charity during November. Some combine the words 
of November and moustache to describe this movement, creating the word "Movember," 
while in the United States, it is often called Novembeard or No-Shave November. 
It is perhaps no accident that this happens in the cold, windy month of 
November, when facial hair can be quite pleasant to help shelter the lower 
face from the elements (although in Australia, the summer is just heating 
up when Movember comes around). Read More
