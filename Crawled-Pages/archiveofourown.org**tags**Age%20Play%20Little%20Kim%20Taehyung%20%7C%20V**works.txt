    Summary
      In the morning, Taehyung is composed again. Weakness is for the dark hours of the night, where no one can see him- to be seen is to be vulnerable, and to be vulnerable is to be hurt. 
***
Taehyung is a little desperately trying to suppress his biology and suffering for it; Namjoon and Jin want to help him before it's too late.

    Summary
   “Keeping our Min safe,” Taehyung says, and he smiles at Jungkook, cheeks round and full. Jungkook answers back with a smile of his own, and Jin feels proud of both of his littles. 
     Such kind boys.  Hobi and Joon at the office, and it's just Jin and Yoongi holding down the fort at home with three littles. Only, this morning, Minnie's woken up all out of sorts.

    Summary
      Yoongi is sometimes a shitty boyfriend and a shitty Daddy but Hoseok needs him and wouldn't change him for anything in the world. He's the most charming hyung ever and he's Daddy af and he's got a huge dick. Hoseok needs his Daddy and his little friends and their Daddies to buy him dummies, stroke his hair, spank him and fuck him. And if they don't then he'll have to adult stuff and worry about his shitty family. (I've never written anything ever before ever but hey its kinky af.)

  “Pop! Pop!

    Summary
      When Yoongi met Jimin, it was love at first sight. He fell for that adorable smile, sweet disposition, and charm.  When he was invited for dinner with Jimin, he learned something about him that he never expected; Jimin was a little.  Being slightly familiar with littles, and with Jimin holding a firm hold on his heart already, Yoongi decided he was going to take it on head first.  Things become difficult however, when Jimin refuses to let Yoongi become his official caregiver despite being in a romantic relationship with him, and will not tell him why.  Yoongi wants so desperately to have Jimin, all of Jimin, that he realizes he must be patient. He keeps telling himself that all Jimin needs is a little bit of time...❗Warning: Includes smut and adult content❗This is a spin off of "Little Bit of Trouble" and "A Little of Your Heart". If you have not read them before, I strongly suggest you start there first. There will be time jumps, mentions of previous characters/situations/relationships that are from those books and it may get confusing otherwise.

    Summary
      Life do not always go as you expected it to be.That was proven true by Seokjin, Yoongi, Hoseok, and Namjoon. The four soon-to-be caregivers had been married for two years now. They had a stable career of being members of a famous boygroup, and the only missing pieces of their lives were their littles.Minnie and KookieThese two are their littles. However, they noticed their littles’ fondness towards another little, TaeTae. They had a close bond and considered themseves as brothers even though they were not related by blood.TaeTae was not up for adoption since he had a dark past towards his foster parents that made the caregivers decide to fight for him. The need of the little to be loved and to be nurtured were the only things that his caregivers wanted to give him.Join the family as they experience their ups and downs, happiness and sorrows, smiles and tears.Besides, life is full of surprises.

    Summary
      "He remembers the way he’d gulped down water in the aftermath, worried about getting sick from being dehydrated. That was definitely his first mistake.
Calling Yoongi directly was probably the second. It’s still the only time Jungkook can remember calling one of Jimin’s caretakers without checking with him first, and he’s never really had a chance to talk to Jimin about whether or not he’d crossed a line in making that call. He figures Karma already got him for it, what with his parents finding him the way they did, and he’s pretty sure Jimin’s of the same mind, so he’s never bothered to bring it up. In any case, he’s made a point to never call them directly again, at least not without permission, since the night Jungkook had shyly asked Yoongi to call him Bunny."
or
Jungkook has been through hell, and there's a lot he needs to work through before he can even come close to being comfortable with himself, nevermind the friends he never meant to make.
Apparently, however, the universe thinks he's moving too slow. Why else would it throw a tiger - a literal freaking tiger - at him?
