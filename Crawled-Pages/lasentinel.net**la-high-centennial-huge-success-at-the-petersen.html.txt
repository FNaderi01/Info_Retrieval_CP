On Saturday, October 21st Los Angeles High School celebrated its 100th year at Olympic and Rimpau during a star-studded event held at the Petersen Automotive Museum in the Bruce Meyer Family Gallery. The Gallery is rightly named after the Petersen’s founding Chairman, lifelong automobile enthusiast, collector AND Roman alumnus, Bruce Meyer.
The event was an extravaganza of LA High talent with exceptional performances by the Jazz Band, Color Guard, Cheerleaders, Outkast Dance Academy and drama students. Student ambassadors greeted guests as they arrived, directing them to the bar, photo booth (generously donated by Snap Yourself, LA’s premier customizable photo booth), and to the remarkable Roman Feast buffet provided by Drago Ristorante, before they were seated for the awards show. County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas began with the presentation of an elegant certificate from the County acknowledging LA High’s Roman Renaissance. This was followed by the awards ceremony with each presentation geared specifically toward the unique talents and history of each honoree and their contributions to society.

The honorees receiving The Roman Spirit Award, included notable alumni George Takei, the actor and social justice activist best known for his portrayal of Mr. Sulu on “Star Trek;” Milt Larsen, magician, entertainer extraordinaire and founder of the legendary Magic Castle; Gerry Brown, Grammy Award-winning recording engineer and producer, who is credited on over 47 platinum and gold records; and long-time president of the Alice G. Harrison Memorial Trust, 1958 Alumnus, Bruce Corwin.

A special Community Outreach Award was presented to Grammy Award-winning Siedah Garrett, best known for co-writing Michael Jackson’s megahit “Man in the Mirror” and as his duet partner on “I Just Can’t Stop Loving You”. Siedah’s latest project is her single “G.H.E.T.T.O.” (Greatness Happens Even Though There’s Oppression) which features GRAMMY and Academy Award-winning rapper/actor/activist, Common. The single is a motivational anthem about not allowing your physical circumstances to define who you are. She personally delivered this message to LA High Students at her alma mater and will continue reaching out to other LAUSD high schools.

The event host, The Alice G. Harrison Memorial Trust, is a non-profit foundation that helps support Los Angeles High School. Named after 1895 Alumna, Alice G. Harrison who left her fortune to the school in 1958, “The Harrison Trust” has been supporting programs and providing “exceptional educational opportunities for the students of LA High” since 1962.
