    Summary
      Crimes are no longer punished by prison sentences, they're punished by terms of slavery. Stiles is purchased by the owner of a Sex Museum and Bordello and is looking at five years of nearly constant sex. Before now, this would have been great. But now Stiles really just wants to never have sex ever again. Unfortunately this isn't an option.
