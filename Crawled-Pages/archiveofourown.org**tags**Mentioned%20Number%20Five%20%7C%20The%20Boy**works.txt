    Summary
      What actually happened the first time around?
There are very few clues of what happened in the first timeline of The Umbrella Academy. What events preceded Five showing up in his Apocalypse? I have tried to figure out the basic events, character by character, but feel free to disagree with me.

    Summary
      There‚Äôs no joy, no relief in his Father‚Äôs gaze at seeing him alive, nothing more than the barest flash of interest before his gaze slides away towards the limp figure hanging in Mother‚Äôs arms.Instead of the bitter thang of jealousy, fear clogs up Ben‚Äôs throat. The movement under his shirt visible for all to see as they tense, restless at the threat to‚ÄîTo what, exactly?The Horror falls silent.‚ÄúVery well then, Number Six.‚Äù Dad turns away. ‚ÄúYou may follow along.‚ÄùIn the following time of his resurrection that Klaus sleeps away, Ben gets the chance to give two of his siblings the closure they need.

    Summary
      As soon as he woke up that day, Luther knew what was coming for him. His training was set for today, and as much as he didn‚Äôt want to, he dreaded it. Of course, he knew his siblings hated the training they went through, it is exhausting, brutal, and over-extensive. At least, that‚Äôs what they claimed it was. Luther knew that it was for the best, especially since Dad said so. He wasn‚Äôt smart book-wise (he knew as such), but he did know Dad was. And if Dad thought it was smart, he thought it was smart. Was there ever any reason to doubt him?Luther's training is today, and once again, he dreads it. But he goes, even if he'll regret it.
