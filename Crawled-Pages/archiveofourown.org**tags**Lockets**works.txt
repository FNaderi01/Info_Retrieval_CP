    Summary
      Draco twisted it between his fingers... back and forth. The metal wasn’t particularly unique in appearance, it was actually rather plain. Yet, the piece had been discovered in the corpse of Hogwarts. Amongst the ruins of his former house, in the dungeons. It bore his family crest. Curious. No jewels adorning it, one of the many faceless minions brought it to him hoping for favor. Everyone recognized the Malfoy crest, feared it. He glanced briefly at the crumpled mass bleeding out on his floor, smirking. Favor indeed. He would need to refer to his father, ask what he knew. How had it been buried there? Who’s had it been? He sensed power pulsing. Curious. His mind wandered back to the blood and smoke of that final battle, the day the Dark Lord rose and conquered... the day hope died. The day many good men, women, and child soldiers fell... that Harry Potter was frozen within Amber... when Granger vanished. Most believed she was dead, but years later, Draco somehow knew she was alive and kicking somewhere. He’d keep orders current for her capture, to be brought directly to him. She’d be alone now... he almost pitied the survivors. His own guilt ate at him enough. The silver almost felt warm.

And if apparating always brings either him to Malfoy, or Malfoy to Harry (even if he's in his shower) it's strange, but nothing to worry about.
