    Summary
      The world died years and years ago, when the bombs dropped and ushered in a new ice age. Raised in the City, the last vestige of civilization, Lena finds herself exiled to the eternal winter after she questions her brother one too many times. But the world she finds outside the city walls is wholly unlike the one she'd been lead to believe in, and all the truths she's accepted before are uprooted by one Kara Danvers and her family.

    Summary
      Sid's demand that Johnny have kids for his mother's sake is insane and infuriating. What kind of arrogant prick thinks they can buy grandkids anyway? Johnny can barely wrap his mind around the idea, least of all because he and Daniel have definitely never talked about having kids. That's just not something guys like them do. Never being parents is just part of the everyday cost of them getting to be together and something like happy. Right?

Non-Linear Narrative
    Summary
      Jake has cystic fibrosis, and has always expected to have a shortened life. Dirk doesn't know what he's supposed to do with his. They've weaved in and out of each other's lives for nineteen years--beginning with a shared cabin at summer camp, to nearly ten years of on and off dating, to the fateful day when Dirk just really wanted a Snickers bar.   Their story is told non chronologically. The chapters jump backwards and forwards in their lives--at the top of each chapter will have an indication as to when it takes place :)

    Summary
      La guerra è finita. Voldemort è morto, i defunti vengono sepolti e i feriti curati.E, a differenza di quanto accade nel settimo libro, Piton sopravvive.Però è stato comunque morso da Nagini, quindi non se la passa per niente bene, infatti deve essere costantemente seguito da una guaritrice, Serena O'Dampand, che andrà a stabilirsi a Spinner's End insieme al professore.E Piton, ovviamente, non ne è affatto contento. Ma tanto non sembra soddisfatto di niente, ormai: a cosa gli serve vivere?Questa storia narra la riabilitazione di Piton, i suoi pensieri, la sua malattia. E chissà che lui non guarisca davvero - da tutto, però..«Basta. La tua vita si è conclusa alla Stamberga Strillante. Quello che vivresti d’ora in poi sarebbe solo un… riflesso. Un fantasticare costantemente – e penosamente – su quello che avrebbe potuto essere e che invece non sarà mai.» (Cap. 3)

    Summary
      Irakli goes back to Batumi to do all the things that are expected of him: get married, get a proper job, do what's right by his parents.It should be fine, going back to how life was before.It isn't.But how does someone who's always wanted to please, who's used to drifting along without causing a fuss, find the courage to pursue what he wants?-Longfic, slow burn, eventual reunion, relationship-establishing, with a happy ending in Georgia. Because the defiance of this film still leaves me reeling and I wanted to try and imagine a future for them there.Shortcuts for those who want them: Irakli is back in Tbilisi from Ch. 32; Merab is around from Ch. 35; there's smut at Ch. 36.For snippets from chapters I haven't posted yet have a look on my tumblr under the tag 'atwd fic'.Massive THANKS to erinaceina my wonderful and very forgiving beta.

    Summary
      San, who was looking intently at his phone, sent him a short look. It seemed like his intent was to check on Hongjoong’s sleeping form, since, seeing how the older man is wide awake, San’s face morphed into a smile Hongjoong grew accustomed to. “You’re awake!” he chirped, hurrying to get to the light switch, and artificial lighting poured into the room, a bit too much for it to be comfortable. Hongjoong shied away from the light like a hurt animal, though he schooled his expression soon after, noticing how San hurried back to his side, his feet shuffling on the ground. Only then did Hongjoong notice the fluffy socks he was donning.

    Summary
      May 15, 1884My friends and I decided to escape the MC Correctional Boarding School and leave to Paris, France. This school would much rather let Darryl die than get him the help he desperately requires. I don't know how we'll get that money, or when. But I know that we will do anything in our power to get enough money to save him.Even if it means getting our own hands dirty.

    Summary
      Since the tender age of 9, Jiang Cheng has been convinced there is something growing within his chest.He fancies it might be a rose bush, full of thorns that poke his lungs everytime his father praises Wei Wuxian while his mother compares his lacking skills to his adopted brother and his sister dotes on the older boy, first and foremost. Or maybe it's a cactus, one that parches his throat dry with a hacking cough when all his friends favor the cooler Jiang sibling and dismiss his minuscule insecurities. But sometimes he contemplates if it's poison ivy wrapping tightly around his esophagus, causing uncomfortable irritation when his childhood crush, flawless Lan Xichen doesn't notice him the way Jiang Cheng notices everything about the older boy.He might not be certain what it is, but all he knows is that he is growing something so magnificent and indescribable. And it hurts.Yet no one believes him when he mentions the pain, when somedays the basic skill of breathing doesn't come easy. He catches the eye rolls, hears the scoffs, fumes at the blatant teasing, and clams up at the scolding he receives for his "exaggeration". Though perhaps his imagination wasn't too far off the mark.

    Summary
      If you have found this story and not read the first installment or the second, please do so.  The existing plot points, characters and establishment of their lives will matter.  We are entering a time in Queen's history that contains many triumphs but will soon lead to a road of tragedy and loss.  The band is at the top of their game as they begin recording their next album.  But the strain of 10 years together is starting to show.  Creative tension and the need to keep up with the pace of a rock &amp; roll lifestyle will begin to create problems.  A new darkness is emerging in the world that will have an enormous impact on all their lives.  It will threaten everything that matters and cause each of them to react in ways they could never imagine.  Will the group survive all the turmoil?  Will Brian and Roger survive the stresses placed on their relationship?  And - what will be the final thing that makes Brian and Roger willing to reveal their most sacred secret to the world?  I hope you will join me for a dramatic journey through the 80's...one filled with love, laughter, tears, mistakes, forgiveness and remembering what matters most...friends will be friends...right til the end.

    Summary
      After the war, everyone assumed they knew everything about Draco Malfoy, but that wasn't true. They didn't know that he had no idea what had been happening for two years when he suddenly woke up to his father and aunt demanding that he identify Harry Potter at the manor. They also didn't know that he was rendered a complete sociopath by a rare disease called 'Heartbreak', which only occurs if a Veela is rejected by their mate before they fully develop at age 16, like at age 11 for example. They don't know any of that until Healer Davidson stands up in court and declares that the Malfoy heir should be released by reason of insanity (or lack of any human emotions). Now, they all know, and they all make fun of him, except for one green-eyed Auror, the only one in the world who can make Draco Malfoy finally feel.

    Summary
      Tharn and Type overcame every obstacle (pretty much) because they were Tharn and Type.Tharn, who got his homophobic asshole of a roommate to fall in love with him, and Type who tamed the drummers' demons and made him subjective to him. They were the power couple of the University and the ship of the century; before everything came to a grinding halt the week before Tharn's 21st birthday.
