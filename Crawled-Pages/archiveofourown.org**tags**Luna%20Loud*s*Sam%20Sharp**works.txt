      Loan wasn't sure exactly what drove her to seek out her Uncle. She needed to get away, yes... but she'd only met the man twice before. And yet, for reasons she couldn't understand... she trusted him. And for reasons HE couldn't understand, he felt an instant bond with the girl. Neither could have imagined the horrible truth that had remained buried for twenty-one years.

    Summary
      This is Lincoln Loud. He washes his hands. He isn't freaking out about the Corona Virus. At all. Nope, not one bit. In fact, he's totally cool with it. I mean, he's 15 now, a Big Boy, and he's the Head Honcho around house. Maybe a nice little vacation upstate will prove to be the right course of action. The Man With the Plan's plans always fall through, except for when they don't.
