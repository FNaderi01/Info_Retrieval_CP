                                        How do I confirm my email address?
                        When you create your account or change your email address we'll send you an email containing a link to confirm your email address.  If you lose that email, or need it re-sent for any reason, you can request a new one.  You won't be able to use some site features until you confirm your email address.When you create your account, and whenever you change your email address, you'll need to confirm or reconfirm your email address. This security measure ensures you've entered your email address correctly and keeps other people from using your email address without your knowledge.
