    Summary
      Brian May led a simple but somewhat lonely life.  He thought it was enough to own a record store and to dabble in his side interests.  His success in the dating world had hit an all time low and he had thrown in the towel.  Little did he know his life was about to get turned upside down.  When a famous music group is in town for some shows he has an unlikely encounter that not only shifts his future but literally and figuratively rocks his world.Roger Taylor is a bored and burned out rock star looking for something more meaningful in his life than one night stands both on the stage and in his bed.   He meets someone who makes him question his future and his true desires.  Will Roger risk everything to have something deeper than a top 40 single?   Will Roger find what has truly evaded him for ages?  Happiness....This takes place in an alternate universe away from Queen.  I have borrowed some things from their real lives to enhance the story and give it some familiarity.  The story takes places in the 1980's. MTV exists in the way that it did then.  Each chapter title will be a song and I will reference the name of the artist.  Go to YouTube to listen before reading the chapter.

    Summary
      If you have found this story and not read the first installment or the second, please do so.  The existing plot points, characters and establishment of their lives will matter.  We are entering a time in Queen's history that contains many triumphs but will soon lead to a road of tragedy and loss.  The band is at the top of their game as they begin recording their next album.  But the strain of 10 years together is starting to show.  Creative tension and the need to keep up with the pace of a rock &amp; roll lifestyle will begin to create problems.  A new darkness is emerging in the world that will have an enormous impact on all their lives.  It will threaten everything that matters and cause each of them to react in ways they could never imagine.  Will the group survive all the turmoil?  Will Brian and Roger survive the stresses placed on their relationship?  And - what will be the final thing that makes Brian and Roger willing to reveal their most sacred secret to the world?  I hope you will join me for a dramatic journey through the 80's...one filled with love, laughter, tears, mistakes, forgiveness and remembering what matters most...friends will be friends...right til the end.

    Summary
      This is a sequel to - You've Got To Hide Your Love Away.  This new story picks up in early 1975 and continues the love story of two aspiring musicians who found love together under unusual circumstances.  I encourage you to read the first story to fully enjoy this sequel due to original characters, character development and existing plotlines.   Brian and Roger fell in love and have stayed together against all odds.  They struggled through the hardships of forming their band and seeing it rise to success.  1975 holds the promise of real fame and fortune.  It has been hard to hide their love away from the public.  Can they keep it private or will the pressures of fame and fortune drive them apart?  They are preparing to return to America in hopes of completing a tour. Everything is looking up for the band and these two as a new year begins.  Their professional career is taking off and the world is at their feet but their personal lives soon get hit by something completely unexpected.  Brian and Roger try to cope with a surprising addition to their lives.  Roger can't deal with the changes in his life and Brian finds himself questioning everything he thought about who they are together.  Can their relationship survive?

    Summary
      So this is a fun little imagine about two rockers who might enjoy participating in something they probably claim to know little or nothing about - Maylor Fanfiction.  This was inspired by a topic on the Maylor 2019 listing.  I was late to the game but here it is.  Thanks for reading!

  Summary
    What if Brian and Roger had become romantically involved with each other before Queen happened?  What is they chose to stay together and try to keep their relationship a secret from the narrow minded world they live in?  How would Queen's story been different if the quarter included a couple?  How would these men manage to maintain this secret while slowing becoming a famous rock band and being ever more exposed to the spotlight?  How would their closest friends and family react to them being together and also work to keep their secret?  I pondered this 'what if' for a while and began writing a story of what might have happened.  This series is a long term look at the challenges Maylor would face trying to be together in a world that doesn't celebrate or tolerate that kind of love.

    Summary
      “So what do you guys make of them?” Ben asks, downing another glass of champagne as he nods in the direction of Brian, Roger and John. “The wannabe rockstars.”Gwil shrugs. “I barely know them. My parents told me that Brian works at a university; they never mentioned he’s in a band.”“Must be a pretty shit band,” Joe adds. “They’ve been playing for like fifty years and they’ve never got anywhere with it. It’s the only reason they’re marrying us, you know. No record label will sign them if any of them are unmarried. We were all desperate enough to need marriages too.” Joe laughs bitterly and thumbs the neck of his beer bottle. “We’re just a PR stunt.”ORIn a world where marriage is the key to everything, Gwil, Ben and Joe are promised to three older men who dream of making their band a success. The boys fear being doomed to loveless marriages, but soon find there is hope still for a happily-ever-after.
