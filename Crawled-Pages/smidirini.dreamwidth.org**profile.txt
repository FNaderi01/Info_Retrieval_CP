                 Mini Bio
                Supernatural &amp; J² own my soul right now.Other than that at the moment I am mostly following Bones, Leverage, House, The IT Crowd and sometimes Heroes and Grey's Anatomy.I adored Firefly &amp; Jericho and it makes me sad that they were cancelled :(The Wire &amp; Buffy: Gone but not forgotten.In the realm of literature I'm pretty much all about fantasy: Harry Potter, Artemis Fowl, Lord of the Rings and The Farseer Trilogy are my loves.And One Tree Hill is my guilty pleasure. I don't watch it every week or anything but yes, there are lots of cute dimples in that show. Shhhh!
