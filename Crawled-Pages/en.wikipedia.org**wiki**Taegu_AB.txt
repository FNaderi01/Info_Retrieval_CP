Overview[edit]
The airport chiefly serves domestic routes with a small number of international flights. Despite the growth of the nearby city of Daegu, passenger numbers at Daegu International Airport have been steadily declining since 2004, the year when KTX highspeed rail reached the city. The 2013 number of about 1.1 million passengers is around half of pre-2003 figures.
Since in 2014, passenger numbers have increased sharply due to the expansion of Low-Cost Carriers.
History[edit]
Daegu International Airport was originally established under Japanese rule as Taegu Airfield on 31 January 1937.[2]
Korean War[edit]
At the outbreak of the Korean War, the airfield consisted of a dirt and gravel runway and two concrete buildings.[3] The airfield was designated by the USAF as K-2.
The airfield was used as part of the Bout One project, an emergency program to train Republic of Korea Air Force pilots to fly the F-51 Mustang. The Bout One planes provided close air support to the U.S. 24th Infantry Division through July 1950.[3]:89–90 On 10 July 1950, the Bout One force was re-designated as the 51st Fighter Squadron,[3]:95 and was merged into the 12th Fighter-Bomber Squadron on 4 August.[3]:112
The existing dirt and gravel runway was improved by the 822nd Engineer Aviation Battalion beginning on 18 July, and the Battalion subsequently began preparations for a parallel 5,000 foot (1,500 m) PSP runway on 7 August.[3]:110
USAF units based at Taegu from July–August 1950 included:
18th Fighter-Bomber Group, from July–August 1950, subordinate units included:
12th Fighter-Bomber Squadron operating F-51 from 15 July 1950[3]:95
51st Fighter Squadron (Provisional) from 10 July–August 4, 1950[3]:95
6002nd Air Base Squadron from July–8 August 1950[3]:95
6147th Tactical Control Squadron (Airborne) operating T-6 Mosquitos from 1 August–September 6, 1950[3]:106
6149th Air Base Unit from August 1950
Taegu Airfield was abandoned following the North Korean attack on Taegu in mid-August 1950, but USAF units began reoccupying the base by 23 September 1950.[3]:176 The 822nd Battalion had returned to Taegu on 17 September and soon resurfaced the original dirt and gravel runway with PSP and extended its length to 5,700 feet (1,700 m).[3]:177
USAF units based at Taegu from September 1950 included:[3]:177
49th Fighter-Bomber Group operating F-80s from 1 October 1950. This was the first jet unit to be based in Korea. Subordinate units included:
7th Fighter-Bomber Squadron from 28 September
8th Fighter-Bomber Squadron from 29 September
9th Fighter-Bomber Squadron from 29 September
543rd Tactical Support Group from 26 September, subordinate units included:
8th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, Photo-Jet operating RF-80s from 2 October
162nd Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, Night Photo from 8 October
363rd Reconnaissance Technical Squadron from 4 October
In May 1951, the 930th Engineer Aviation Group began repair work on the PSP runway and commenced construction of a 9,000 feet (2,700 m) concrete runway.[3]:395

Passenger facilities[edit]
  Daegu Airport interior
The relatively small passenger terminal boasts a comfortable environment through its adoption of traditional design elements symbolizing Ouga (The song of five friend: water, rock, pine, bamboo, and moon; by Yun Seon Do), and its crane-like structure.
The parking lot can accommodate about 1,097 cars and has a fully automated parking system; it opens from 6 am to 10 pm.[4]
