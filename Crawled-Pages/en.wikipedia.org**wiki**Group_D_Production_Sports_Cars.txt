		CAMS motor racing category
Group D Production Sports Cars was a CAMS motor racing category current in Australia from 1972 to 1981.
The Group D category catered for series-production type automobiles, other than those eligible to compete as Touring Cars, which were: 
Recognised by the FIA as Group 3 or Group 4  cars,[1] or
Of a type of which at least 50 examples existed in Australia,[1] or
Of a type which CAMS deemed to be eligible [1]
Bodywork could be of an open or closed type and was required to provide adequate accommodation for a minimum of two persons.[1] The original design of the cylinder-block, cylinder-head, transmission and suspension had to be retained and forced induction was permitted only if fitted as standard by the manufacturer.[1] Minor changes to bodywork, mudguards and interior trim were permitted.[1] A 5000cc engine capacity limit which was applied at the time of the introduction of the category [2] was later raised to 6000cc.[3]
Cars from the Group D Production Sports Cars category were eligible to compete in Australian Sports Car Championship races alongside those from the Group A Sports Cars category from 1972 [4] to 1975 [5] and in May 1975, Production Sports Cars contested the revived Australian Tourist Trophy held at Calder Raceway.[6] In 1976, Group D became the sole category to contest the Australian Sports Car Championship, a situation which applied through to 1981.[7] The category was discontinued at the end of that year [8] and the Group D designation was applied to a new category for GT Cars from 1982.[9]
Group B Improved Production Sports Cars and Group D Series Production Sports Cars[edit]
Prior to the introduction of the new category in 1972,[10] the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport had promulgated regulations for both Group B Improved Production Sports Cars and Group D Series Production Sports Cars, the former for modified vehicles of which at least 100 examples had been produced and the latter for virtually  standard cars.[11] Both categories had been introduced in 1964.[12]
