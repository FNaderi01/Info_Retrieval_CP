    Summary
      Light Yagami is the intelligent son of the police chief who dreams of the day he can lock up every last curse worker in the city. But after being attacked by a notorious emotion worker, Light discovers he himself is the very thing he hates. Rather than taking the opportunity to gain some empathy and perspective, he decides to use his newfound gifts to slowly eliminate all the other workers. It's ideal... until a nosy detective decides to put a stop to the murders.

    Summary
      In another world, Light Yagami doesn’t become Kira. But the presence of a death note in the human realm still exists. Meanwhile, Light’s life becomes increasingly difficult as events both horrible and strange keep happening to him. As time goes on discoveries are made, secrets come to light, and lies are stripped away.  Disclaimer: I don't own any of the Fandoms or the Mythologies listed, but I do love them. And constructive criticism is more than welcome.

    Summary
      He’s drowning.Someone is following him; trudging behind, matching his steps, and they are but a shadow in a deep, dark ocean. They stay at his heels through reality, through dreams, through nightmares, leaving a trail of death in their wake and gifting him nothing but their unwavering obsession and a name: KIRA.(An AU where Light never picks up the Death Note due to his sensitivity towards negative energy, and gains a stalker that chases him through reality and dreams alike.)Cross-posted on ff.net

    Summary
      "Everyone thinks that we're perfectPlease don't let them see through the curtains."Sayu knew she'd been born into the perfect family.

Over the course of a few years, Sayu gets to watch that 'perfect' family crumble. The story of Death Note, as seen through Sayu's eyes. Inspired by the song 'Dollhouse' by Melanie Martinez. One-shot.
