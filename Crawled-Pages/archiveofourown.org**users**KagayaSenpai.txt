    Summary
      Here were the many ways that Alex had viewed Zach over the last two years:At first, as a shallow jock. One who enabled his friends and who may not have actively tortured people, but who certainly didn’t do anything to stop it.Then as a brother-in-arms, shoved together by the circumstances of being mentioned on Hannah’s tapes.Then, Alex was pretty sure he was using him as his personal penance. Why else would he have spent every afternoon with Alex, helping him with physical therapy? Alex had resented him and adored him in turn. Finally, he became home to Alex. The first person who didn’t treat him like he was cracked porcelain. Alex loved him for it.
