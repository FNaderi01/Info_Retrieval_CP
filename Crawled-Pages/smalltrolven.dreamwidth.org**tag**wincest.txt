Title: Sleeping DesireAuthor: smalltrolvenPairing: Sam/DeanRating: NC-17Wordcount: 7,866Warning: Schmoop-filled to the brim.Author’s Note: Not my characters, only my words. Written for the 2019 spn_meanttobe for prompt 56, Sleeping Desire. “Sara had run away from Alex Stevenson's demands of unquestioning love, but her amnesia made her forget her year away from him. Until she saw the woman who had caused the break up of their marriage. Then shatteringly, everything fell back into place and she saw the caring and protestations of love were all part of the plan to make her stop their divorce. Her parents were in on that, too, constantly trying to bring them together. All of them treated her like a child – they didn't seem to realise that the pain and hurt of the past year had made her grow up into a confident woman, sure of what she wanted. But was she so sure of not wanting Alex?”Summary: Sam wakes up in Kermit, Texas on Amelia’s front porch. He’s badly beaten and bleeding, with a whole month worth of memories just gone. He finally recalls writing a horrible note for Dean after a fight they’d had on a hunt. Does Sam even have a home to go back to? Read it over on AO3 right here.*****( Read more... )
