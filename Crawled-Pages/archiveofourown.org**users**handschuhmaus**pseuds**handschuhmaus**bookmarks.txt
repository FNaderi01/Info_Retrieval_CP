    Summary
      When Tahani hears that her little sister is getting married, from what seems like every news site on the planet, she knows what's coming. She knows the media's focus on her will start to shift to why she isn't married yet, and her reputation can't afford another hit after Cleveland.So she hatches a plan. Platonically marrying a man over twice your age is a good plan, right?(Funnily enough, it works out perfectly.)

    Summary
      A while back I went looking for a comprehensive list of Redwall foods, and I couldn't find one. So I decided to make one. This was, perhaps, a rather silly decision, but here is the result, and I hope the next poor silly creature looking for this information doesn't have to re-read all twenty-someodd Redwall books to get it.

    Summary
      “Are you implying that I am responsible for Voldemort’s actions?” Dumbledore’s voice had finally turned cold.“No, I’m saying you’re responsible for neglecting a young boy! You treated him with nothing but suspicion and coldness, and when he grew up suspicious and cold you took that as confirmation that you were always right about him.”“I assume you have a reason for laying these heavy charges at my feet,” said Dumbledore quietly.She sighed. “I just think… maybe you should take your own advice and try to solve this problem with love, not destruction. You don’t have to destroy a Horcrux. You can heal it.”“You speak of remorse,” Dumbledore didn’t sound impressed. “If I may, I see very little chance of convincing Voldemort to feel empathy for the things he has done –”“Not Voldemort,” she interrupted. “Tom.”“You are suggesting that we use Voldemort’s first Horcrux to reanimate sixteen-year-old Tom Riddle.” Dumbledore's tone left much to be desired.

      Lee is used to winning his Gobstones matches, and he thinks he can come out ahead in the game of life. If only things were as simple as when he first met Tobias at that pub in Cokeworth. In a perfect world, he sure as hell wouldn't be pregnant and learning his way around a Muggle kitchen, but it's 1959, and he is all bones and weary mind, weighed down by the flesh that doesn't feel like his own.

    Summary
      Ginny has always felt wrong for as long as she could remember. Uncovering that there is a name for it should have been a relief, if only she had known sooner. At 36 years old, married and a mother of three, Ginny has to decide whether to risk the life she has to become who he was always meant to be.

  Summary
    Most AUs stem from simple ideas: what if Harry Potter was sorted into Slytherin, what if Neville was the chosen one, what if Hermione was half snake? From these simple ideas ripple effects that change the story at first subtly, but more and more as each aspect becomes more warped from canon.Sometimes, I don't have the patience for that.So what if there was a series where these simple ideas were stacked on top of each other? What if Harry took on the invincibility that was his due as a horcrux, what if Draco barely had enough magic to cast the simplest of spells, what if Hermione was a deaf natural legilimens? What if these AUs and more were all in the same story at once?What kind of maniac would do such a thing?Welcome, to Tied to the Tracks, where we'll hit the stations of canon even if we have to turn this train around.

After all, Snoke is forcing them all into roles that they have to play.Literally.(Someone on one of the tumblr ao3feed blogs tagged this as reylo - probably an automatic thing - and it really isn’t any ship at all)

    Summary
      "Chuck Wendig's Force Awakens novel Aftermath suggested that post-Jedi, the last vestiges of the Empire fled to the Unknown Regions. Could they have met a non-humanoid called Snoke who shaped them into the First Order? Or maybe he's just Mike Snoke from downtown Coruscant." --Empire, Oct 2017 issueMike Snoke lives a boring life as an office worker on Coruscant before discovering his destiny and the power of the Dark Side.

    Summary
      Adam Young was meant to be the Anti-Christ. His entire purpose was to cause the end of the world. In many ways, he was the Chosen One, albeit for a rather dark path. But he was raised completely human and normal, without any unusual expectations of him beyond being a regular boy. He remained unaware of his heritage or destiny until the very end. And though he was chosen, he did not accept his role and rejected it and his connection to Lucifer.Warlock Dowling was not chosen. He was born as an ordinary child, with no special skills or powers. He should have lived an average life. But he was raised with certain Expectations. Occult and ethereal entities Expected him to be the Anti-Christ. He was not chosen or fated for such a role, but reality tends to bend a little when angels and demons have Expectations.The apocalypse may have been averted, but not everyone is relieved. Heaven and Hell may not believe that they can execute the traitors, but they also cannot let Aziraphale and Crowley go unpunished. Unfortunately for them, two not-quite-so-normal boys have some rather strong opinions on the topic.
