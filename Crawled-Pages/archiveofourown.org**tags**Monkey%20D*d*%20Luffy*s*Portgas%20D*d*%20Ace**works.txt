    Summary
      Monkey D. Luffy debe elegir entre ir a la cárcel o casarse con el misterioso hombre que su abuelo ha escogido para él. Las bodas concertadas son una cosa del pasado... ¿O no? Portgas D. Ace, tan guapo como hosco, no tiene intención de jugar a ser el novio cariñoso de un pequeño cabeza hueca. Dispuesto a domarlo a su manera, arrastra a Luffy desde su destacado lugar en la alta sociedad a un pequeño circo itinerante, pero este hombre sin alma ha tropezado con uno que es todo corazón. Antes de que pase mucho tiempo, la pasión los tendrá a su merced y sin red de seguridad...Fanfic "adaptación" del libro "Besar a un ángel" de SUSAN ELIZABETH PHILLIPS.

    Summary
      This is a collection of one-shot stories that I've written. All stories are different ratings and pairings ratings will be in the summaries/notes of each story along with any warnings. The work as a whole will be rated Explicit because there are Explicit stories but not all of them will be. Requests are closed as of today (September 19th) because I'm starting classes next week. If you've already made a request but it hasn't been posted, I'm working on it!!For the sake of not wanting an entire wall of tags, only ships will be tagged, everything else will be in the notes so rEad them. Enjoy!

Luffy Loves His Friends Everyone Loves Monkey D. Luffy Baby Monkey D. Luffy Adorable Monkey D. Luffy he just wants to be king of the pirates Doflamingo needs therapy Lots and lots of therapy Dubious Consent Fluff Lust at First Sight overfed snails
    Summary
      Doflamingo wasn't expecting much when he has to stay on an island for a bit because of major storms. Instead of a nice relaxing time off like he was expecting he ends up with a baby to raise. One that's going to require a hell of a lot more responsibility and patience than he or his crew ever expected to have to deal with! He isn't really sure how he ended up with such a defiant hyper spaz of a brat, but he loves him anyways and can't stand even the thought of him ever leaving! Much to his annoyance someone's been filling his baby's head with stories about pirate kings and adventure. Now his Luffy was hell bent on becoming pirate king!
When Luffy finally does manage to run off he ends up making far larger a name for himself than Doflamingo ever wanted, catching the attention of handsome guys far and wide. 
Not only does he have to keep Luffy from wandering off on him he needs to make sure his beloved Crocodile understands that they are just so right for each other! How can't he see that they were perfect for one another? Why was his beloved family always being so difficult? They acted like, him wanting their constant love and them to never leave him, was unreasonable or something! It was ridiculous!

    Summary
      Yandere/possessive Sabo loves Luffy and wants to protect him no matter what. Especially from anyone who wants to take his innocence or away from him. Luffy lives in an apartment with Sabo, Ace is at college out of state. Sabo is obsessive about protecting him from Ace; even though Ace has done nothing wrong. Potential gore later on, I'm not sure though. I doubt Sabo would hurt him, just because he's so obsessed with sheltering him and keeping him 'innocent'.

      Basically just a bunch of random stories with a bunch of pairings. There is going to be "reader" characters once in a while. I do take requests on the PAIRINGS. Please just leave me a pairing and a specific kink. No more overly specific requests please. Especially if you're going to be an ass about it if I write it and don't write it specifically enough.

    Summary
      Luffy had eaten the paramecia Eat-Eat fruit, the superior model of the Munch-Munch fruit, whatever Luffy eats he’s able to absorb into his body. He’s able to manifest the traits of anything he eats, from wild beasts, sea creatures, be they cooked or raw. Another unique feature is his fruit has a memory feature, he simply has to eat something once and he can manifest the traits as he wills it.

    Summary
      Monkey D. Luciella was a curious child, a little girl determined to become the next Pirate King, a title that has been left vacant for four years before her birth and with a powerful gift from her mother's lineage. The marks on her wrist reflective of the (unheard of) soulmarks that are so common in her mother's home. And a child born with the Will of D. Watch as she brings about a storm that shakes the very foundation of the World Government in her quest to be the freest person in the world.If she has to destroy a few tyrants (warlords, kings, marines) and the like, well... even freedom comes at a price. And who is she to deny the freedom of others? Hopefully, Ace will one day stop having heart attacks from her actions.
