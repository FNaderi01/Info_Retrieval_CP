We have just finished all sixty episodes of the cdrama Oh My General! Would I actually recommend watching all sixty episodes of Oh My General? I think that depends on how much you require your 'plot' to be 'good' .... Okay, so the starting plot of Oh My General is essentially: "After Mulan led her armies to victory and revealed her gender, what happened next? ... a rom-com!" Triumphant general Ye Zhao, the Living God of Hell, has been living as a man for decades after the death of the rest of her warrior family; now, having saved the Empire but deceived the Emperor in the process, she's technically liable for the death penalty. Instead, the Emperor lets her keep her job and appoints her as his advisor, but also decides to marry her off to his most beautiful but useless fop of a nephew, thus rewarding her for her accomplishments and tying her to the royal family in one fell swoop. Who could possibly complain? Not Ye Zhao, actually, who is cheerfully thrilled by the prospect of being matched with some adorable arm candy with whom she may or may not have a secret childhood backstory that only she knows about.

Micah Nemerever's These Violent Delights is a really fantastic entry into the rich genre of homoerotic thrillers about subsuming one's identity into an intense and destructive relationship; it's also, very relevantly to me, not only an extremely queer book but an extremely Jewish book, with a deep undercurrent of diaspora culture and generational trauma running through the text.The plot: it's the 1970s in Pittsburgh, and seventeen-year-old Paul Fleischer's working-class Jewish family is still in mourning for his father -- a weight of stifling emotion that Paul desperately wants to escape. Then Paul meets college classmate Julian Fromme, brilliant and vicious and wriggling furiously on the hook of his very different family's very different expectations for him. Pretty soon, the two of them are inseparable, which is where the hard part begins, but not, of course, where it ends. Julian and Paul's mutual obsession makes both their families very uncomfortable, for some bad reasons (it is the 1970s and everyone Knows what is going on but they do NOT want to say it), but also some very good ones! These bright and disaffected kids are eventually going to do a murder and it's going to be bad; the book tells you this at the beginning. It's not a secret. The book is about how we get there, and how Paul and Julian transform each other along the way, in large part by staring deeply into each other's eyes and trying really hard to become the person they think they see in the reflection without stopping to check their perceptions against reality. And a major element of that self-idealization -- for Paul, at least, our POV character for almost all of the book -- is the struggle to be better than the world in which he finds himself: a world just one generation past the Holocaust, a world of Nietzsche and My Lai and the Milgram Experiment, in which it seems impossible to believe that any human being doesn't carry the seeds of, not just evil, but banal evil inside of them. This book has been pretty frequently compared to The Secret History, and for good reason, but the thing that sets this apart from that, for me, is the specificity of the place and time and circumstances that shape Paul and Julian into what they become. The Secret History is a brilliant book, but I absolutely could not tell you in what decade it takes place; I genuinely think it changes scene to scene. Richard's family doesn't matter, Henry's background doesn't matter, what matters is the all-consuming environment of the college and the claustrophobia of the relations among the kids. In These Violent Delights, on the other hand, it matters tremendously that Paul's grandparents were socialists, that Julian's father conceals his Jewishness, that Paul's mother and sisters are slowly working their way out of grief even as Paul is twisting further and further inwards.I don't want to say, like, 'if you like gay books with murder, give this a go,'although it is absolutely a gay book with murder, because I feel like that gives an impression of lightness that's a little misleading. But if you like thoughtful and extremely well-done character/relationship studies with some gay murder in them, and up for feeling a lingering sense of uncomfortably haunted claustrophobia long after the close of the book, I would strongly recommend.

When I read Silver in the Wood last year, I was excited for a sequel but found it difficult to conceive of what it would look like, since the story felt so complete in and of itself.Now I've read Drowned Country and it did more or less the best thing that a sequel can do, which is make me retroactively belief that Silver in the Wood would be thematically incomplete without it despite having previously felt that it stood alone perfectly well. The thing about Drowned Country is -- I'm going to do my best to do this without spoilers -- Silver in the Wood ends a certain way, and, at the time, it seems like a right and appropriate ending, and even a happy ending. And Drowned Country takes that ending and complicates and re-examines it in ways that I really appreciate and that it would have been easy not to do. ( Okay here are spoilers )

For some time now I have been informed that I should probably watch Mob Psycho 100, as it was very good, and I accepted this cheerfully as most likely true but did not in fact do anything about it. Then eventually various people made a concerted effort to bully me into watching Mob Pyscho 100 by telling me that it was like a Frances Hardinge novel, which unfortunately everyone knows is my weakest flank, and then blotthis came in for the kill by offering to watch Mob Psycho 100 with me, and so now I have seen Mob Psycho 100 and promptly moved over to wanting to tell everybody else that in fact they should probably watch Mob Psycho 100 as it is really in fact extremely good!... and also, yes, a little bit like a Frances Hardinge novel, on the basis that our protagonist Shigeo Kagayama, aka Mob (a nickname for 'background character'), is a sweet if sometimes accidentally terrifying child who draws in feral companions and morally ambiguous mentors like a maraschino cherry factory attracts bees.( Cut for length )

Given the year it's been I've actually read surprisingly few romance novels, which is going to give it less heft than I mean when I say that Aster Glenn Gray's Honeytrap is I think the best romance I've read this year. It's just very good!Honeytrap follows Daniel and Gennady, an FBI agent and a Soviet agent, who are assigned to work together on a mission to find a lone gunman who fired a relatively useless shot at Khrushchev on his tour through the United States. No one actually expects them to succeed on this, but both sides see it as a potentially useful opportunity -- Gennady's sleazy boss would like Gennady to gather blackmail material on Daniel, including honeytrapping him if at all possible, and Daniel's bosses want him to convince Gennady to defect. ... and in the meantime, Gennady and Daniel get to take a really nice road trip! They talk about books and eat at diners and inevitably have to share motel rooms with only one bed and fall a certain amount in love, because that's often the kind of thing that happens when you spend quite a lot of time with someone -- but life is complicated, and people's lives take different directions, and falling a certain amount in love with someone you can't quite trust on a road trip across the country is a large chunk of but in no way the end of this love story, which spans thirty years and a whole lot of Gennady and Daniel's lives.  The thing I love most about this book is the length and complexity of the relationship dynamics -- it's in no way Unwise Lust At First Sight, you get to see these people growing to like and (perhaps unwisely) trust each other on the page, and the strength and nature of their feelings is often unequal at different times as they hit different points in their lives. ( Broad spoiler for the back half ) I also extremely appreciate that this is also not the kind of book about a Romance Across the Iron Curtain where it's assumed that the happy ending will by default involve the character from the Soviet Union coming to golden America. It reminds me a bit of Crash Landing On You in the way that it validates and centers Gennady's relationship to the Soviet Union, and parallels it to Daniel's relationship with the States: ideology and propaganda and legitimate flaws abound on both sides, but your home is your home and the people you have there, and in order for the romance to succeed that needs to be balanced. It's really well done and really good, and also consistently surprised me in ways that I enjoyed! I did want a longer last section but that's mostly because I was enjoying the whole thing so much that I truly did not want it to end.

What I knew for sure about Harrow the Ninth before reading it:- it's generally considered to be a weirder book than its precursor Gideon the Ninth, which, for those unfamiliar, is about a group of terrible teen necromancers and their sword-fighting sidekicks competing to find the secret to immortality in a mysterious castle with a serial killer and/or terrible bone monster on the loose. In space. - a dramatic and tragic scene is capped by a 'none pizza with left beef' reference (thanks for the warning aria, I was very glad to be braced for it)Harrow the Ninth is indeed a weirder book than Gideon the Ninth, in large part because it becomes very clear very quickly that the protagonist not only has very little idea what's going on in the present, but also that there is significant confusion about what happened in the past as well; a solid third of the book is dedicated to recounting a version of the events of Gideon the Ninth that does not in fact include the titular Gideon the Ninth. Since the relationship between Gideon and Harrow is the main emotional thread of the series, this is an audacious choice! ( I respect it intellectually while not being sure how well it works for me emotionally )As a sidenote, I also reread Gideon the Ninth before reading Harrow and I am glad I did both for enjoying-the-experience reasons and for having-any-clue-what's-going-on-with-Harrow reasons, but ( spoiler questions )

When I first read the setup of The House in the Cerulean Sea, in which our kind but blinkered bureaucrat hero gets sent to audit the mysterious foster home on the abandoned island with the potentially sinister proprietor and the six ominously magical children including the Antichrist, I was like "oh, I know what this is! This is a queer Gothic!"As it turns out I was not in the least correct about this. The House in the Cerulean Sea is not at all a Gothic; what it is, in fact, is kidfic. From the moment Linus Baker first encounters Arthur Parnassus and his six magical kids, there is never any doubt about the fact that a.) Arthur is a perfectly charming and wonderful human and parent b.) the kids, including the Antichrist, have various quirks and backstory traumas but are at heart affectionate and adorable and c.) over the course of the month that he spends there, Linus is going to fall head over heels in love with all of them as he learns Important Lessons about prejudice, thinking outside the box, and the role that theoretically benevolent bureaucratic institutions such as his own DICOMY (the Department In Charge of Magical Youth) play in maintaining hegemonical systems of oppression.So, if what you are looking for is soothing gay kidfic about a bureaucrat opening his heart to a perfect man and a new magical family, The House in the Cerulean Sea may be a good choice! I do want to emphasize the soothing and fuzzy element, like ... this is not really a book that's super interested in the emotional complexities of children? Two weeks and about one heartfelt interaction per kid is all it takes, more or less, for all of them to welcome Linus into their hearts as a second father figure. After that, the threats are all external. The kids are sometimes rude to Linus when he shows up, but they're never jerks to each other, or to Arthur, and their different needs never compete; Arthur never screws up as a guardian or feels anything but absolutely infinite love and protectiveness towards the kids, and once Linus Gets Over His Prejudices, his attitude is more or less the same. I mean, I guess the thing is that this is not a book in which providing for the various physical and emotional needs of kids with wildly different backgrounds, or with a history of abuse or trauma, or indeed with destructive magical powers, is ever really a difficult thing to do. Like, as an example -- one of the kids is a wyvern, straight up just a different species, and Arthur and Linus are passionately willing to defend his intelligence and right to be treated as a child rather than a magical pet, and that's great, but then that's ... enough? That's as far as the book goes. The wyvern is a kid, and we treat him as a kid, and we have learned to understand his chirps, and we respect his hoard, and that's fine. He cherishes the beautiful bronze buttons we give him. Nothing about kids or dragons or adoption is harder than this. (Also it's a book about prejudice and oppressive systems which is all centered on the fake thing [magic] and not on any of the real things; racism and homophobia do not seem to exist in this world that is otherwise similar enough to our own that Buddy Holly died in a tragic plane crash, all prejudice has been displaced onto distrust of magic. Not sure how I feel about this as a strategy although I understand the desire for worlds without homophobia etc. which is another element that may contribute to the soothing nature of this book.) (I also had worldbuilding questions about the fact that nobody else seems to have any religious or existential questions about the existence of Little Lucy The Antichrist and his Real Dad who is the devil, but again I think that is probably looking harder at this gay magical kidfic than it's really intended to be looked at.)

As we know, Elizabeth Wein's superpower is to look critically at any character archetype and go "What if that, but a WWII pilot?" but as far as I know her latest, White Eagles, is in fact only drawing from an actual factual historical World War II pilot: our heroine Kristina is a fictionalized version of Polish pilot Anna Leska, who escaped Poland by plane when the Nazis took over her airfield and then rejoined the remnants of the army to continue the war in France, then England. In the White Eagles, Wein gives Kristina a stowaway: Julian, a fierce Jewish eleven-year-old who's determined to convince Kristina to take him all the way to his family in England in her out-of-date plane with a big Polish Army flag on the side of it. Since the plane can only travel about five hours at a time, this journey requires several fuel stops, generally in unfriendly bits of Europe and involving significant obstacles that needs to be overcome by either Julian's cleverness and bravado, Kristina's guts and flying skills, or their developing partnership. Julian is very much in the Telemakos model -- a brilliant kid with outsized determination and ruthlessness for his age, motivated in large part by personal trauma -- but the prose style of the book, as with Firebrand, her last book in this vein, is definitely aimed significantly younger than the Aksum saga. This is sort of fascinating to me because the actual level of trauma in the content is pretty much equivalent, the way it's written about is just much ... less descriptive and more matter-of-fact? But like. By page 30, the Nazis have taken over Poland and Kristina has seen someone she loves get shot in the head at point-blank range. Later, there's a rape threat that's only thwarted by an eleven-year-old with a gun. It's all in there, just with prose that is, also, suitable for eleven-year-olds or younger. I don't really have an opinion on this, I just think it's an interesting shift. Both this and Firebird were kindly sent me by osprey_archer in the spirit of a traveling book club, so if anybody would like to be their next stop, let me know! I enjoyed both but would be happy to pass them along.

Aster Glenn Gray's new spy romance is up for preorder now, which reminded me that I had not gotten around to writing up her latest, The Time-Traveling Popcorn Ball!The Time-Traveling Popcorn Ball is quite different from the other Aster Glenn Gray books I've read -- it's a really charming kid's fantasy along the lines of Edward Eager or Anne Lindbergh, of the genre "lonely child makes friend via magic, the limits of which imperil the friendship." Eleven-year-old Piper has just moved to a new town with her older sister Angela and their newly-widowed, depressed father when she receives a mysterious note from someone she doesn't know, apologizing for something that hasn't happened to her yet.The note turns out to come from Rosie, the girl who lived in the house fifty-ish years ago, who has apparently been having time-travel encounters with Piper for years -- always when Piper is aged eleven. Over the course of the next few months (in Piper-time), Rosie and Piper's friendship strengthens even as everything else in Piper's life feels like it's crumbling. But the more important Rosie becomes to Piper, the more worried Piper starts to get about what's going to happen when she hits her twelfth birthday .... Aster Glenn Gray is really good at writing believable, complex kid-friendships; magic brings Rosie and Piper together, but what keeps them together is a shared sense of imagination and the dramatic, the fact that they're both kids who are willing and eager to lean into the magic and try and figure out its rules. I also love Piper's relationship with Angela, who is trying extremely hard to balance "making new friends and figure out own life in new place" with "be a good older sister to a little sister who's really struggling" and mostly but not always doing an endearingly good job of it, which is deeply important but still not quite enough to be everything that Piper needs. This could also very easily be the kind of story that ends in a melancholic fashion, with the fading-away of magic, and I'm very glad to report that's not the case! I would have loved this book when I was twelve and I found it extremely delightful to read now, too.

N.K. Jemisin's latest, The City We Became, is very much a paean to New York City -- a city I love and have lived in and have a lot of feelings about, and also a city I did not grow up in, and no longer live in, which is also relevant, I think, in how complicated I'm feeling about The City We Became.The premise: sometimes, very old, very lived-in cities undergo a complicated evolution in which they become sentient entities, born and avatar-ized in the personage of someone who both lives in the city and is powerfully representative of the city's character in some key way. New York is the second city in the Americas to undergo this process, assisted by its predecessor São Paulo (New Orleans and Port-au-Prince having both almost made it but died in the 'birthing', possibly as a result of interference by a sinister cosmic entity, on which more anon) but something is weird and different about New York: a.) in addition to the one Avatar of New York, there are also five separate avatars representing each borough, and b.) the sinister cosmic entity attempting to kill the city at birth has also personified itself and brought its A game to bear against New York in a way that none of the other personified cities have ever seen before.( Putting this under a cut because it's long and a bit navel-gazey and technically a little spoilery )tl;dr;it's a well-written, well-characterized, and compelling book that I have some complicated feelings about on a broader conceptual and metaphorical level, and I think some of my complicated feelings are just 'I don't get on well with books that are more than 50% metaphor'. But also I have a book club discussion about it tomorrow so I'm sure some of my thoughts will change as they come into contact with other people's!

I was four books into the Mallorean when the quarantimes hit and the libraries shut down, and I absolutely refused to purchase a.) any of the Mallorean but especially b.) just the last book of the Mallorean, so I had to wait several months until a handoff from sandrylene could be arranged to complete my self-assigned labors. What I remembered about The Mallorean, from my childhood, is that it was more or less The Belgariad all over again except a little bit better and funnier. Also, that 'Zakath the mildly reformed sociopathic emperor and Cyradis the eternally obfuscating blind seer had a beautiful romance that Teen Becca cared about very, very deeply. Here, now, in the year 2020, I bring the sad tidings that 'Zakath/Cyradis is extremely boring and reads exactly like every other destined David Eddings romance, which is to say it has not a single thing to do with either party's personality and involves a lot of fairly tired sexist jokes. Instead, the ONLY Mallorean relationship I care about, here in this year 2020, is Sadi (the manipulative eunuch from the Culture of Drugs, Snakes and Sensuality that is Definitely Not a Racist Caricature) and Liselle (the Beautiful Undercover Spy from the Culture Where Everyone Is Spies) coparenting a tiny adorable poisonous snake and her newborn even tinier snake babies!!! I'm VERY invested in this. I absolutely reject the canonical ending that Sadi and his snake family end up in a different country from Liselle at the end of the book. Family is important! Liselle and this snake are bonded, you can't separate them now! (Liselle/Sadi is not a canonical romance, because David Eddings does not think eunuchs can have romance. Liselle is instead the canonical romance for Silk, the original Spy From the Culture Where Everyone Is Spies; as you might be able to guess, she's exactly like him, but female and half his age. This is a little disquieting but also still gives them more to build a relationship on than literally any other canonical Eddings couple, and therefore as a result I will graciously allow Silk to make a triad with Liselle and Sadi if he wishes, but only on the condition that he act as equal coparent to the poisonous snake.)Anyway. In other thoughts, the Mallorean is probably very slightly better than the Belgariad, in that it is mildly less racist (half the cultures written off as One Hundred Percent Evil in the last book get one sympathetic representative this time around! though I'm not sure the King of the Murgos counts when he's literally only likeable because ( spoiler if anyone cares?? )) and also several of the new characters are better than the old characters. However, it also loses some points against the original, for the following:- I'm not sure I have made it clear enough how much the Eddingses revel in the fact that they are really just writing the same book series, all over again, and getting paid lots of money for it? The entire last book is just a long sequence of Garion running into NPCs and thinking profound thooughts about how much they resemble the last round of NPCs from the first series, because the Eddingses have a pallet of maybe five stock characters to choose from and they have just decided to act like this is a feature rather than a bug. One does respect the chutzpah!- there's a sequence in the third book in which a deadly plague breaks out. Our Heroes, who are currently prisoners of 'Zakath, advise 'Zakath that for the good of his realm he must immediately impose an quarantine on the city. "At least 50% of the people trapped here will die," they explain, sympathetically, "but this is the way it's got to be! For the greater good!"Then they decide ... to take advantage of the fact that 'Zakath is distracted by the quarantine ... to sneak out of town and continue their quest ...I read this book back in December 2019 and our protags blithely breaking quarantine made me angrier than literally anything else in the series. Shockingly, I don't feel better about it now! - ok, let me just share this bit of Garion dialogue, from the buildup to the end of the quest:"We -- and Zandramas, of course -- have been trying to find Korim and to keep the other side from finding out where it is so that we can win by default. It was never going to happen that way, though. The meeting absolutely has to take place before Cyradis can choose. The prophecies weren't going to let it happen any other way. Both sides have wasted a great deal of effort trying to do something that simply could not be done. We should all have realized that from the very beginning. We could have saved ourselves a lot of trouble."David Eddings, I knew, I knew that this whole FIVE BOOK SERIES was a lot of pointless water-treading for no actual purpose, but did you -- did you really just have to come out and say it? Did you have to make us both look like fools that way, David and Leigh Eddings?? (Yeah. I know you did. I brought this fully on myself.)

For most of the past week I've been out of the city of Boston for the first time since the quarantimes began, and I spent a significant chunk of that time reading out loud from Leo Marks' Between Silk and Cyanide to genarti and my parents whenever any of them would sit still long enough to listen.Between Silk and Cyanide is a memoir by Leo Marks, who in 1941 was deemed too much of an unreliable misfit to go work at Bletchley Park and as a result was instead sent to SOE to handle the cryptography of their various sabotage operations in Europe. Some relevant facts about Leo Marks:- he was Jewish and absolutely petrified by the prospect of facing combat- his parents owned a moderately famous used bookstore - after the war he went on to become a playwright and screenwriter, which means that the book is extremely entertainingly written but also one has to cast a slightly skeptical eye at some incidents of dialogue that seem perhaps slightly too cinematic for reality - in 1941 he was 21 years old, which means that one spends a significant percentage of narrative clutching one's face and screaming "CHILD!" as, for example, in his initial interview for the position:He began the interview by asking what my hobbies were."Incunabula and intercourse, sir."It slipped out and wasn't even accurate; I'd had little experience of one and couldn't afford the other.AN INFANT. (Later on, he gets assigned to visit Cairo on Top Secret Codes Business and is petrified by the prospect of telling his adoring parents, who are convinced he's not capable of going across the city on his own, let alone leaving the country. "They need to have their heads examined, sending a baby to that awful place," wails Leo's Mum, of a youth currently responsible for overseeing all cryptographic traffic sent between London and SOE agents parachuted behind enemy lines.)Anyway, immediately upon arriving at SOE headquarters, the Infant Leo becomes appalled by the lack of security and danger to the agents of the poem-based codes in use at the time, and embarks upon a one-man crusade to a.) develop better cryptographic methods and b.) convince his superiors that resources ought to be devoted to them. His methodology is often very funny and extremely twenty-one-years-old of him -- at one point, for example, he comes up with a cunning plan to force someone to read his report by marking it 'TOP SECRET,' leaving it in an unlocked drawer, and promptly reporting himself for breach of security protocols -- and you often understand all too well why Marks' superiors and coworkers are frequently furious at the obnoxious wunderkind who keeps barging into their offices and yelling that everything they're doing is wrong and bad. With all this said, Leo's first most endearing quality as a writer is that he is not only witty and self-aware, but also more than happy to make himself the butt of the joke and admit his own shortcomings, failures, and hubris, as well as occasional highly relatable moments of slapstick. The second and far more significant one is that all his efforts are clearly driven by a profound conviction and sense of personal responsibility about the fact that bad cryptographic protocols are killing agents, and as funny as the book is much of the time, it's also very clear that Marks was and remains deeply haunted by SOE's losses. Several significant SOE figures show up over the course of the book, but some of the most space is reserved for Noor Inayat Khan, Violette Szabo, and Leo's friend F. F. E. Yeo-Thomas, all of whom were captured by the Gestapo in France. (On a lighter note, he also spends a lot of time tearing his hair out over Einar Skinnerland, whose cryptographic traffic is as sloppily coded as his clandestine achievements are heroic.) Aside from the Ongoing Quest for Better Cryptography, the other main thread of the book is Marks' conviction that all SOE agents in Amsterdam have been captured by the Germans, based on the use of their secret security checks followed by the subsequent implausible perfection of their cryptographic traffic, and his deep frustration and panic about the fact that his superiors will neither do anything about it nor allow him to tell anybody else. The parts of the book where he talks about having to keep a professional face when providing briefings to officers that he's convinced are being dropped straight to their deaths are incredibly affecting. By the time the war ends, a now twenty-five-year-old Marks is significantly less of an infant, and deeply and understandably exhausted by both cryptography and the vicious politics of war. (It's worth noting for the sake of independent verification that none of Marks' reports about this issue survive in the war archives, so the only source for Marks' ability to detect the deception in Amsterdam before the rest of SOE is Marks himself. Relatedly, Marks claims that the only report of his that does survive to the present day was a youthful attempt to understand cryptography through a Freudian perspective titled "Ciphers, Signals, and Sex." Given that a full chapter of the book is dedicated to one of Marks' colleagues attempting to explain the 'awkward time of the month' to him as it relates to his mostly-female codebreaking team while he makes the confused math face, one doesn't put a lot of stock in his conclusions but one does expect it to be hilarious. Alas, attempts to recover this important document have apparently failed.)Anyway. Highly, highly recommended for anyone who's at all interested in this particular period of history -- thank you to sovay for reminding me that I've been meaning to get around to it.

Last month a friend and I took a Zoom lecture series on the Jewish Labor Movement, which was ... not as full of specific detail as had been hoped, but it did remind me to finally read a book I'd had sitting on my shelf since I found it in a used bookstore a year or two ago: Revolutionary Yiddishland, a history of twentieth-century Jewish radicals constructed around a series of interviews conducted in the 1980s with survivors of the early twentieth-century revolutionary movements by Alain Brossat and Sylvia Klingberg.The interviewees were all militant activists in either a.) the Communist party, b.) The Jewish Labor Bund, or c.) Left Paole Zion (the Marxist branch). These organizations, while all radically left-wing, were ideologically opposed to each other in a variety of ways and members had very different experiences and perspectives on events such as the October Revolution, the Spanish Civil War, and the Soviet Union's actions during World War II -- one interviewee, for example, describes being arrested and barely escaping execution as a member of the POUM during the Spanish Civil War, while another talks about being shown documents that 'proved' to them, at the time, that the POUM were collaborators, and completely accepting the necessity of liquidation. The authors are clearly really interested in drawing out the complexities and the contradictions of these different experience, as well as the broader meta-contradiction of the fact that they as interviewers (and openly partisan radicals themselves who are pro-labor, anti-Zionist, and deeply critical of the state of Israel) specifically chose to interview only activists who are now living in Israel, many of whom were and are equally conflicted about the existence of the state of Israel and then-current affairs there. From the introduction:It would be quite wrong to believe that, by confining our study to Israel, we sought to demonstrate the 'necessity' of this end of the journey. Quite the contrary. [..] By questioning witnesses who today live in Israel, most of whom, for the greater part of their lives, did not give a fig for a Jewish state [..] we focus yet again on the illogicality of history. They then relate an anecdote about one of their interviewees, who chose to have his identity concealed under a fake name and profession. "We thought this imposture indicated a certain cowardice unworthy of this man, who concealed himself and kept silent about a past that was precious to him," write Brossat and Klingberg (which gives you, I think, a little bit of a sense of Brossat and Klingberg, who are certainly thoughtfully interested in complication and contradiction but not, like, un-judgy, as writers.) Anyway, two years later this person was arrested as a spy for giving Israeli bio-secrets to the USSR; Brossat and Klingberg's attitude about this is a not unreasonable take that "whether it's the people developing bio-weapons or the people selling bio-weapons, everyone sucks here," and -- -- okay hold the phone I have just discovered NOW while writing this BOOKLOG and noticing that the NAMES WERE THE SAME that Marcus Klingberg, the spy, is the FATHER of SYLVIA KLINGBERG, THE CO-AUTHOR?? This information is not contained anywhere within the actual text of the book??? "A certain cowardice unworthy of this man," WHO IS YOUR DAD. HOLY SHIT. I'm so sorry, everyone, I really was settling down to write a serious post about this book's merits as a document of a complex and important facet of history regardless of how closely aligned you are with the politics of the authors and what you think of the conclusions they draw from it, and now I'm just spiraling as I attempt to grapple with this new perspective. Her dad!

Over the course of time when I was doing costume polls, several people politely asked me a.) what Hotel Del Luna is actually about andb.) is it goodThe answer to b.) is ... yes? I think it's yes! Like I know that I enjoyed it a tremendous about but also I think it is genuinely really very good; I found it not just a visual fashion feast but consistently surprising in really endearing ways. As for a.) .... yes, I'm sorry, it is time for another picspam.( The short version is it's a Beauty and the Beast story where the Beast is a glamorous ghost hotel owner )One last thing that I truly and deeply love about the premise that is ( kind of a spoiler )

I used leftover clips from "Our Ghost" to make a birthday joke for shati, who immediately and truthfully pointed out that this is in fact probably a more accurate representation of Chicago Typewriter. "chicagotypewriter" (Watch on Vimeo)

By the Book: A Novel of Prose and Cons is a high school rom-com targeted towards people who like a.) friendship stories b.) sibling stories c.) a constant, affectionate stream of references to nineteenth-century literature....it is me, I am that person, I think I got about 90% of them. (Somehow I've managed to completely escape Tess of the D'Urbervilles.)The premise: naive, overeducated Mary has just transferred from her tiny inderdisciplinary program for professor's kids to a more traditional high school. After a rocky start when her best-friend-of-convenience from her old school decides to ditch her, she is absorbed into a clique of new friends ... ... who are, despite the skepticism of some of the more high-school-genre-savvy members of Mary's family, in fact genuinely nice and well-meant and interested in being her friends! The main conflict centers around the fact that Mary's adoption into the group comes via her habit of mapping bad high school boyfriends onto bad boyfriends of nineteenth-century literature, and as a result she struggles with feeling like she must remain a Font of Literary Wisdom, especially when the first boy she identified as Bad turns out of course to be both Pretty Cool Actually and Kind Of Into Her. The boy in question is indeed perfectly sweet and I have no beef with him, but the real heart of the book is very much the story of Mary learning how to model genuine friendship and believe that her new friends group might like her for her own sake and not just because they've all really bought into bibliomancy via Austen.  I'm also very fond of Mary's large array of siblings, who are all involved in their own sub-conflicts. My favorites, of course, are the Cool College Twins who are having lesbian Shakespeare society drama, because I am always going to be here for lesbian Shakespeare society drama, but the sarcastic baby brother is also charming and Mary's changing relationships with all of them as she undergoes her coming-of-age are extremely sweet. The book overall is really very warm-hearted about all its characters -- even the Mean Former Best Friend plotline is mostly an exploration of how people sometimes grow out of each other and it's really not anybody's fault -- which makes it a very soothing read, especially if you also happen to find it soothing to play the game of Name That Brit-Lit Plot Point every chapter. (I do think Mary is wrong about some of the lit, but this is to be expected of a fifteen-year-old; a person can't really be expected to appreciate Moby Dick until they are older. Also this is vastly hypocritical of me to say given that I still haven't actually read Moby Dick myself.)

You know, the thing is, it's not even that I have a particular pre-existing interest in WWII spycraft -- or at least I didn't, before I started reading Ben MacIntyre -- it's that I have consistently found people who write about WWII spycraft to be really good narrative nonfiction writers with excellent primary source research, a relative minimum of un-sourced speculation, and a solid sense of the ridiculous. All rarer than you might think! Except, apparently, among the subset of historians who specialize in narrative nonfiction about British intelligence agencies during the war. Anyway, I just finished Operation Columba: The Secret Pigeon Service, a really in-depth look into the British use of homing pigeons for intelligence and counterintelligence, and while I really didn't intend to livetweet another book so soon after Amy's Eyes I just enjoyed the pigeon facts so much ... The actual objective of Operation Columba was to drop homing pigeons in occupied France, Belgium, and Amsterdam, armed with rice paper, tiny pencils, pigeon-feeding instructions, and a survey questionnaire about a.) any top secret information the pigeon recipients might wish to share and b.) the quality of BBC radio service in their area. (I understand the tactical importance of the latter during wartime, but it remains particularly delightful to me as a public-media-adjacent professional.) Despite the dangers, quite a lot of people did actually write back via pigeon post, and the author is determined to make the argument that the information they provided and the services rendered by the pigeons were key to victory in Europe. The book is more or less split between the bureaucratic details of the pigeon service on the British side -- a riveting tale of pigeon politics and hobby drama, featuring, among other elements, a gay occultist Baron, a pair of Girl Guides, and accusations of national secrets splashed in Racing Pigeon magazine -- and the much more dramatic story of a group of Belgians who picked up a pigeon early on and were inspired to form themselves into a proper spy ring, making beautiful secret maps in the hopes that they could eventually get a second pigeon to send them to Britain.(...instead, Britain parachuted in a couple MI6 spies to make contact with them ... who were greeted with a general sentiment of "nice to meet you? but where are our pigeons??" At least, this is certainly the tone conveyed by author Gordon Corera, who also very clearly feels this way about MI6.)As a result, the book itself manages to be both a compelling narrative about ordinary people running great risks to express resistance under occupation, and an extremely funny account of Weird Wartime Activity. Gordon Corera absolutely cannot resist a single opportunity to make a pigeon joke -- the book is littered with phrases like "pigeons were low in the pecking order of intelligence requirements" -- and to this I say, with all my heart, more power to him. Write what you love! I leave you with this image of a 'pigeon bra', for parachuting in troops with as many pigeons strapped to them as possible:

Last week, the polls agreed with Jang Man Wol that this look absolutely deserved to be immortalized:And now we're on the sixteenth and final episode! And going out with a bang, as Jang Man Wol has graciously provided us with a full banquet of THIRTEEN outfits to choose from for this, her swan song.( Thirteen episode sixteen outfits under the cut )

I'd like to point out that is the second week in a row that a blood red murder outfit has carried the costume polls:I mean I'm not complaining, they're both incredible outfits, but it seems very clear you guys have a Type. The choices have been moderately restrained recently as the plot ramps up, but this week's penultimate episodes sees Jang Man Wol back in form with no less than eleven outfit selections to choose from!( Eleven episode fifteen outfits under the cut )
