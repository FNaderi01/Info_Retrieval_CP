    Summary
      The only thing separating him and all the power in the world is a few inches of metal.
Stephen's already explained that there was no way to bring someone back to life with them. Bringing back half the universe was easy, as they hadn't been dead, merely... hidden away for a while.
He would die, he thinks, if he tried.
(He thinks someone should. Try, that is. Thor, or Carol, or Bruce, once he's better. It's selfish, he knows, but he can't help but think it. He wonders if Pepper thinks it too.)
AKA: the story where Peter uses the Time Stone to go back in time to try and save Tony. Unfortunately, Peter finds out it's harder than it seems.
Spoiler: Happy Ending included I promise

    Summary
      “No,” Jaskier sighed. “This is the thing, Geralt. I’m middle-aged and tired and I just think I’d rather meet death sitting down and facing it rather than from behind while I’m running. You know?” He contemplated that a moment, and finally added, “Especially if it’s you.”Set after the end of season 1.UPDATE: The Fat Baby song in chapter 7 now exists here as composed and recorded by @fannishliss and is BRILLIANT.
  See Series Notes on this series for a list of all the fics and what chronological order they go in, as well as recommended reading order if you're into that, just so you know what you're getting into here.

    Summary
      Geralt manages to get his life saved by a peculiarly friendly Siren, and as payment agrees to allow the creature to accompany him, unsure as to why Jaskier would want to leave his lake behind, nor why he would choose Geralt to tag along with.

    Summary
      In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake’s language pass his lips, and this isn’t what he wants, what’s the point of insulting Malfoy if he can’t understand him – Malfoy’s eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry’s mouth, “Potter, what the hell–”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)
