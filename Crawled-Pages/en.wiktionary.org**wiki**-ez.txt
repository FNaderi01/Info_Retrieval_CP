Etymology 2[edit]
Probably from a Vulgar Latin *-idiō or *-izō, form of the suffix *-idiāre or *-izāre, ultimately from Ancient Greek -ίζειν (-ízein), but used as an infix in Romanian conjugated forms of verbs (similarly to how Spanish and Portuguese use the unrelated -ecer from Latin -escere, from -escō (as in parecer, padecer, merecer, etc)). The suffix does not appear in the infinitive form of the verb in Romanian, however. The Latin *-idiāre or *-izāre has also led to -eggiare in Italian, -ear in Spanish and Portuguese, -ejar in Catalan and Occitan, and -oyer in French. The Aromanian equivalent is -edz or -edzu. The infinitive form of the Romanian suffix can also be found fossilized as part of the infinitive of a few verbs, such as boteza, râncheza, undeza. Compare also the Romanian suffix later borrowed ultimately from the same source (through French), -iza.
Suffix[edit]

 used with a stem to form the first-person singular present of some -a (first conjugation) verbs.

dura → durez

Spanish[edit]
Etymology 1[edit]
From the Latin genitive suffix -icī, from -icus, originating as a calque of surname-formation conventions of the Visigoths. Cognate to Portuguese -es.
Alternative forms[edit]
-es
Suffix[edit]
-ez
A suffix forming many Spanish surnames.
‎Enrique + ‎-ez → ‎Enríquez
‎Lope + ‎-ez → ‎López
‎Gutierre + ‎-ez → ‎Gutiérrez
‎Sancho + ‎-ez → ‎Sánchez
Usage notes[edit]
Spanish patronymics are often formed by substituting "-ez" for a final "o" or "e" in the first name of the father of the person whose surname is so formed. Thus, the son of Hernando becomes "Hernández", the son of Álvaro becomes "Álvarez", and the son of Enrique becomes "Enríquez".
For some Spanish patronymics, the suffix is not -ez but -iz or -oz, as in Ortiz, Muñiz, Muñoz. The name Cortez is not a patronymic but derived from the adjective cortés (“courteous”).
Derived terms[edit]

Etymology 2[edit]
From -itiēm, the accusative of Latin -itiēs, an alternative form of -itia. Compare Romanian -ețe and Portuguese -ice.

‎estúpido (“stupid”) + ‎-ez → ‎estupidez (“stupidity”)
