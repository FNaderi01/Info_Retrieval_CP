    Summary
      Broskies... Idek tbhüòÇI had the idea for a Kuroo Story and we sprinted with this bitchWe got nerdy Kuroo who talks to his grandma about crushes and just needs some loveWe got Kenma being anti social and bad at feelingsYakuLev may make and appearance ;)You want BokuAka? You'll probably see someMC (you or whatever OC you use for these inserts) Moves a lot and struggles in using the usual "fuck off" vibes once interacting with a handful of idiots in your class. Mutual Pining and insisting you totally don't have a thing for the Volleyball Captain ensue. Friendships blossom. Fears are explored. Your single father manages to snag the heart of mother of the rival team Fukurodani. Even more shenanigans follow.

    Summary
      hinata shouyou has made the three by far biggest mistakes of his life1. inviting the volleygays into one groupchat2. putting bokuto, kuroo, matsukawa, and hanamaki into said groupchat3. also adding iwaizumi hajime into that same groupchathe will probably never have a good night's rest because they cannot shut up, and kageyama wont either.hinata shouyou regrets making this group chat

    Summary
      Daichi and Suga were well aware that they were acknowledged as the ‚Äúparents‚Äù of Karasuno, they couldn‚Äôt ignore it by how much it was brought up to them in person or even on social media. Unbeknownst to them, Nekoma was having problems with this ‚Äúparents‚Äù thing as well with Kuroo and Yaku being the media-confirmed parents of Nekoma. Coach Nekomata organizes a ‚Äúfriendship training camp‚Äù where they‚Äôll have to live under the same roof. The whole camp is sure to be a handful for our loved parents, but‚Äôll be worth it in the end, right?

    Summary
      Hinata isn't the best with direction and sometimes gets a bit too distracted. Sometimes he is lost within the sea of people when getting around. It's been the same as far as he could remember. It's been the same patter of getting lost, waiting foe the others to find him, and when they find them they go on with their day. The first few times it had happened were because Hinata had gotten distracted and the Karasuno team were lucky enough to find Hinata on their own. Sometimes when Karasuno goes to team events the ginger can easily get lost, and sometimes they can't find their sunshine on their own.
They're gonna need some help...
---------------------
Or a series of One-Shots that follow Hinata's adventures with other teams after he get's seperated from his own.

    Summary
      It's Not All Sunshine &amp; Rainbows, But it's pretty close. The beginning of their timeline isn't as well lit, their case files would rather be blank themselves. Couldn't stay where they used to, aren't able to see who they biologically belong to, and can't seem to find themselves in the mess of the world...but they try their hardest. - OR a kid AU where there's a lot of adorable adopted kids who come with unique trauma and the mothers end up taking a trip to the beach for two weeks. When the mothers leave, what results will always be an adventure.

  Kuroo scoffs and rolls his eyes playfully. "Showing your true colors again, Demon-senpai?"
  Yaku grins at the nickname and slugs Kuroo in the shoulder. "Please. I'll always be the scariest one on the team."
  "Maybe because you're such a parent," Kuroo snorts and Yaku aims a kick for his knee this time.
5 times Yaku takes care of his team, plus the 1 time they take care of him.

    Summary
      A snort fell past her lips as she rolled her eyes. "Tobio sure can be full of himself sometimes."Hinata looked confused while Tobio silently glowered at her. Her blond classmate - Tsukishima Kei? - narrowed his eyes at her, the smirk that had been playing on his lips fading.She shrugged, turning on her heel. "It's good to see you, Tobio. Try to make a good game, okay?" She smirked over her shoulder.~~~~"Kageyama," Shouyou turned to the taller boy in confusion after Tsukishima left. "Who was that?"The boy still looked pissed, but he took a deep breath while picking up the volleyball. "She was the captain of the girl's team. But I'm not sure why she's at Karasuno."
