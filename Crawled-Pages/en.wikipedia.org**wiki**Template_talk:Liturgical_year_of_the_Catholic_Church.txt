Colour improvements[edit]
Colours could be a bit adjusted according to Liturgical colours#Roman Catholic Church, for instance with colourboxes after single events with exceptionate colours. Chicbyaccident (talk) 17:21, 24 April 2016 (UTC)
All Saints is white[edit]
could somebody perhaps color All Saints in white instead of read, which is its actual color?--2001:A61:20B5:8701:455D:DC83:71B8:9850 (talk) 10:19, 19 June 2017 (UTC)
Annunciation[edit]
Why is the Solemnity of the Annunciation placed under Ordinary Time? It always falls during Lent (or, when transferred, even Easter) in the Western liturgical year. (I don't dare editing the template, I'm not that tech savvy.) AxelWN (talk) 22:49, 12 January 2019 (UTC)
Thanks for spotting that. Fixed. Jdcompguy (talk) 09:01, 18 December 2019 (UTC)
Processions[edit]
I removed the recently-added designation of processions because, to the best of my knowledge, such processions are done out of popular piety, rather than being prescribed in the rubrics (Palm Sunday being a notable exception), and as such, are not part of the liturgical year per se. Sources would be welcome. But even if these processions are somehow an official part of the liturgical year, I'm not sure that this template is the best place to mention to include that information. People can read about processions on the appropriate pages. Jdcompguy (talk) 08:59, 18 December 2019 (UTC)
While not of essential importance to the topic, how much does it hurt? Did you read the relevant section in the processions article for relevance? PPEMES (talk) 11:31, 18 December 2019 (UTC)
I read the article. For the procession list it cites the Roman Ritual, which does not exist in that form in the Ordinary Form of the Roman Rite. This navbox is about the Ordinary Form, not the Extraordinary Form. My question remains: Is there a list of processions (in the rubrics of the Ordinary Form) that you're pulling from? There may be, but, to rephrase what I said before, even if there were, such processions are rarely done in practice (with a few exceptions), so the information on them, in my opinion, doesn't meet the threshold of what constitutes "overview information" suitable for a navbox. Jdcompguy (talk) 16:03, 18 December 2019 (UTC)
The closest thing to an "overview information", I guess is what is currently offered at Procession#Roman_Catholics. What if we take it from this angle: would you say information on processions could be made a template? If it was created, would you have opposed a merge proposal of that template with this one, since both pertain to the calener? PPEMES (talk) 12:39, 19 December 2019 (UTC)
My primary concern is that you appear to have confused the 1960 and 1969 calendars. This navbox is for the 1969 calendar, for which these processions do not exist, as far as I know. (I'm willing to be proven wrong on this.) My secondary concern is that, even if such a list of processions does exist for the 1969 calendar, they are practically never done in liturgies that follow the 1969 calendar, so do not constitute relevant overview information. If you were to make a navbox for the 1960 Extraordinary Form Roman Rite liturgical calendar, I would have no objection to you putting in the 1960-era processions list, because (#1) that is the calendar to which the processions apply; and (#2) such processions are more common in traditionalist communities, so the information would be relevant. Jdcompguy (talk) 13:58, 19 December 2019 (UTC)
Oh. The original intention was not to convey exact reference to this or that calender but to offer a hint of actual recurrent use in practice. PPEMES (talk) 16:06, 20 December 2019 (UTC)
As far as I know, the only place in the world in which the old procession traditions are regularly maintained even under the 1969 calendar is rural Western Europe. In the context of the traditionalist liturgy that uses the 1960 calendar, the processions are celebrated more broadly, but that calendar is outside the scope of this navbox. Jdcompguy (talk) 08:31, 21 December 2019 (UTC)
Notwithstanding to what extent that assertion is true, the legend said "possible processions" (in the Latin Church). If the "above" variable of the template was changed to "Based on" rather than "According to", would you accept including the small detail in question then? PPEMES (talk) 10:51, 21 December 2019 (UTC)
No, the 1960 and 1969 calendars are quite different. Here's what I've done: I've added the 1960 calendar as a collapsible subgroup to the navbox, together with the associated processions. See if it meets your approval. Jdcompguy (talk) 14:50, 21 December 2019 (UTC)
Thanks! Looks great. If you have any suitable image for also the extraordinary form, please add likewise. Thanks for your contributions! PPEMES (talk) 16:45, 21 December 2019 (UTC)
Thanks. I might make an image sometime later if I have time. Jdcompguy (talk) 18:38, 21 December 2019 (UTC)
