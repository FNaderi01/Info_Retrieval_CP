                 Mini Bio
                Raised from Birth by Cynics, the Author has all her own teeth, a fear of grey hair, and an unhealthy collection of shoes. Currently resting between offspring, she hopes one day to be Internationally Renowned and to pay off all her existing Credit Card debts. The value of her stock goes up as well as down, and she is available in sizes 12-14. Mostly, she hasn't a clue, but you knew that anyway.Until recently she was also without form, function or socks. At least two of these issues have now been adressed, so expect an increase in writing, abuse and general tomfoolery in the months to come. If she upsets you, get over it. If you like that kind of relationship, jump right in.Possible alternative Adventures in Geekery are To be Confirmed. Stay Tuned.
