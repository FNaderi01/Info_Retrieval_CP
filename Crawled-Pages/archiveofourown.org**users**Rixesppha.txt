    Summary
      Midoriya Izuku hasn’t stayed in one place for too long since he was four, not when the fates called his name and beckoned him away. He had tried explaining when he was younger, but no one listened, not even his mother had believed him. He stopped trying and would come and go as he pleased, until UA took an interest in the boy with Lady Luck on his side.

    Summary
      Izuku plays video games with the League of Villains, denies being a villain, has his beloved animal crossing file threatened, kicks ass with a shotgun, is proposed to, learns to deal with his depression, and accidentally kidnaps the son of the number two hero. In that order. 
Or: Five times Izuku played online with his friends, and one time he played with them in person
  Then Himiko screams.“CAPTAIN!” 
  “Y-yeah?” Tomura asks almost hesitantly. 
  “LOOK!!” 
  All four of them spin around, right as a cannonball comes soaring inches from Izuku’s head from the Galleon less than a three feet away from them. 
  They scream. 
  “OH FUCK NO NO NO NO! NO!” Dabi yells, running to load the cannons. “DUDE WE HAVE SO MUCH SHIT! NO! HOLY FUCKING SHIT!”
  “Hey guys, guys! Hey, chill!” Izuku shrieks frantically, right as one of the players boards their ship and starts shooting. “CHILL THE FUCK OUT!”

    Summary
      The truth hit everyone like a car driving at full speed.
Midoriya was...innocent?
Kirishima hadn't stopped crying since coming back, Uraraka and Iida were drowning in misery and regret, and the rest of the class was equally horrified at their actions.
Meanwhile, Shinsou, Todoroki and Bakugou isolated themselves from the rest of the word, giving Midoriya as much comfort as he needed, and trying to mend the broken pieces in his heart.
The news of Midoriya's innocence were like a nuclear explosion, and this was the fallout.
