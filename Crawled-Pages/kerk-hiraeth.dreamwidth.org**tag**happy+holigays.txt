Happy Holigays! aka My Xmas 2019Dec. 31st, 2019 09:20 pm
    Spent christmas with my good friend Ciaran and with Mousey, a gift from elisi; who loves Shakespeare and Emily Dickinson and A Muppet Christmas Carol, which they like despite the Rat, because Rizzo is actually a cool dude behind the scenes; also present is Maz Kanata, presented to me by John Nellies of Bits 'n' Bytes, who gave me a roof over my head when I was homeless.   They both played a part in saving my life, and still do.   As does Ciaran; whom is as good a friend as anyone could wish for.    We had two large pizzas christmas eve; Ciaran's gift, which were eventually finished late Boxing Day, and watched Die Hard and xmas episodes of Northern Exposure and Gilmore Girls; neither of which are actually about xmas :-)        Actually managed to have my first tub of Haagan-Daaz actually on Dec 25th for several years. Got to watch White Christmas actually over christmas as well for once.    kerk hiraeth   Late update; have just been delivered of a freshly made Clootie Dumpling, made by John's Mum to the recipe, or so I believe, of his Gran, who used to make me one every xmas before she passed away.
