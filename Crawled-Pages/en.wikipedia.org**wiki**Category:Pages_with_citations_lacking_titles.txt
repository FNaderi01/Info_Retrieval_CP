		This category is not shown on its member pages unless the appropriate user preference (appearance → show hidden categories) is set.
This is a tracking category.It is used to build and maintain lists of pages—primarily for the sake of the lists themselves and their use in article and category maintenance. It is not part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme. 
More information:
This category is hidden on its member pages—unless the corresponding user preference is set.
These categories are used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing "attention en masse" (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone's earliest convenience.
These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or sub-categories into a larger, more efficient list (discriminated by classifications).
This is a tracking category for CS1 citations without |title=, |chapter=, |article=, or |booktitle=, etc.
 Help desk
Missing or empty |title=
Missing or empty |series=
This error occurs for Citation Style 1 and Citation Style 2 templates when all of |title=, |trans-title=, and |script-title= are omitted or left blank.  At least one of these title parameters must be provided for each citation.
{{cite episode}} will show this error if |series= is omitted or left blank (even if a |title= is provided).
Sometimes this error occurs because an editor has used a CS1|2 citation as a shortened footnote when {{sfn}} or one of the {{harv}} family of templates would have been more appropriate. This error also occurs when an editor used {{citation}} but intended to use {{citation needed}}.
To resolve this error, provide a value for |title=, |trans-title=, and/or |script-title= or replace the CS1|2 template with a more appropriate template. If you are listing a periodical or an issue of a periodical in a bibliography rather than within &lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt; tags, {{List journal}} may be more appropriate.
Pages with this error are automatically placed in Category:Pages with citations lacking titles.[a]
