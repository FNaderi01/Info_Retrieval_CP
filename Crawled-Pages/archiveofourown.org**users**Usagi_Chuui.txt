    Summary
      Hua Cheng has been Hua Cheng since he was fourteen years old. His debut song was titled ‘The Day You Left’ and was about a breakup, the same as all of the most boring and successful ballads...He had been so incredibly young—an age that people would have typically laughed and teased for being too young to even know what love was, let alone heartbreak—but had such moody eyes and such a sad, sad smile that he’d collected thousands of fans overnight.That was the beginning of it all.//global superstar Hua Cheng becomes unlikely friends with a cashier at a meatbun restaurant who bears an uncanny resemblance to an old pop star that fell out of public favor years ago

    Summary
      “Gege...” he says, voice trailing off. “What’s wrong, San Lang?” Xie Lian asks, glancing at the bed too. It looks pretty normal, minus the blanket he’d given Hua Cheng. “Do you not like cats? I can shoo Ruoye away...” “No, gege, it’s just...You don’t have a bed.” Xie Lian blinks and glances back at his bed, “uh? I do?” --or 'the bedframe one'
