    Summary
      “I'd like to give an announcement,” she began, feeling like she was about to give a formal address. When all that got her was expectant silence and focus, she cleared her throat again. “It's been a year now, and the repairs are mostly done, things have calmed down, the trials are mostly over with and things are returning to normal,” she began. “Hermione, Kingsley, Percy and Arthur are all at the Ministry to make sure nothing disastrous happens and Neville is keeping the Auror Force on track.” She glanced at her friend, who blushed bright red at the praise. “Ron's joining him and, I figured I should go on an extended vacation.” Harry was silent a moment to let her family absorb the news.
Deciding to go on a Migration was the best decision Harry had ever made.

    Summary
      Skull didn't want to start again, but he's glad he did. A new start allowed him to embrace his Metamorphmagus abilities, his political power, and make true friends. Also featuring confused magical Arcobaleno, because when a timeline collapses, wrapping your magic around your friends leads to hilarious results.

    Summary
      Viper was never strong, but they know how to get what they wanted. And Viper wanted to survive. They've survived one Hell and came out on top, so why would the Mafia be any different?Viper's a survivor, never a hero. They will do anything to further their own gain and protect their own. Viper's a Misty Cloud after all, and Checkerface will rue the day he dragged her children into a world they should've stayed far away from.Or; In which Viper was not always Viper, and, due to a little accident, history is changed, love is formed, and a child dies.(Inspired by Kuroyuki_Kokuyoku's 'Acedia'.)

    Summary
      "Hariel Dorea Potter was born with emerald green eyes, an auburn tuft of hair, and an umbilical cord wrapped around her bluish gray skin. A breath…two…then her forehead crinkled, cheeks puffed out, and the room exploded in a rainbow of color from the little flame centered right between her brows. Sirius Black muttered Russian curses under his breath and Lily Potter shared a grim look with her husband. "
In which Hari never makes it to Hogwarts but still becomes a witch and gets roped into killing Voldemort before giving Europe the middle finger and settling in Namimori. Death hovers close, her friends won't leave her alone, and the poor neighbor boy is going to get killed by his own ineptitude if she doesn't do something about it.

      Everyone heard about him. The brilliant Sky who'd help anyone in need before vanishing into the air. Who would perform incredible feats, and summon creatures, and plant forests of bizarre man-eating trees. The most coveted Sky. 
Harry? Just tried to live out his other-worldly pension in peace.

    Summary
      The Arcobaleno, betrayed by their previous Sky, are always looking, always searching, always wondering. But days turn to weeks and weeks turn to months and months turn to years, and to search and have hope with no results is too painful, even for them, so they stop. They go on with their day-to-day lives, sometimes allowing themselves an illusion of hope before crushing it once more. It is when they cease to look, to search, to wonder, that is when she finds them. And so the strongest seven finally belong. And she does too.
