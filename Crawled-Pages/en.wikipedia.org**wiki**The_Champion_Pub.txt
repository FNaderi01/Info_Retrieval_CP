Description[edit]
The objective of The Champion Pub is to train and later to fight in the pub by making the right shots with the ball. Toys on the playfield include for example a punching bag, a boxer figure and a jump rope that consists of a rotating wire that the ball has to jump over by using a button-controlled solenoid. A mini-playfield contains plastic fists instead of flippers.[1][2]
Game features include 4 Multi-ball modes and 15 Jackpot levels, 10 different international opponents and over 300 speech sound effects.[3]
Game quotes[edit]
"Welcome to Champion Pub, kid!"
