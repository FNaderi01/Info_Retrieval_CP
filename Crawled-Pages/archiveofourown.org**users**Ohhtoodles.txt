    Summary
      This is a series of one shots (at least for now) following my rewatch of CM. I am currently just going episode by episode and deciding if there's any angst I can milk out with my bb Reid. It's possible that not all chapters will be based off episodes, I may do some extras to give some fun sick!reid moments or other extras but we'll see. I don't have any definite plans at this point, just doing this for fun. Enjoy!

    Summary
      After everything that happened to them in the past, they all vow to be a better sibling to one another. To finally be a complete happy and normal family, well as normal as they can get given their dynamics, history and experiences. But it seems like destiny is still not yet done with testing their strength as a whole family, given that even after settling down the bad blood between the Hargreeves and the commission, new enemies showed up out of the blue. And as always, Five can not catch a break.

    Summary

Easy.
