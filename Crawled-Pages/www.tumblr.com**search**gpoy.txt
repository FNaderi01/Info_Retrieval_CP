Just read the Parasitology, super proud of myself for breaking into the Mira Grant stuff because I‚Äôm such a scardy baby, I wasnt sure I‚Äôd make it. Now I‚Äôm rereading to pay attention to the ground work that was laid knowing now what happens.I admit there are some continuity issues, which is the primary complaint I see with these books, but all of it feels like problems keeping synced up between revisions. And it also seems so uncharacteristic of Seanan‚Äôs writing as to make me wonder what happened.I haven‚Äôt written a novel but I have a master‚Äôs degree and I‚Äôve done journalistic style editing for some friends websites, my bff is getting her doctorate in journalism, so a bit of writing experience. I know enough to know, I don‚Äôt know a damn thing. I can‚Äôt imagine writing on this scale and the revisions needed. Like maybe she started with a two year time table and jumped to six years and didn‚Äôt catch all the places that needed to be updated.The big thing I see in reviews, the thing with the dogs between books 1 and 2, I just mentally dropped a few sentences at the end of book one and it is fine. The dogs didn‚Äôt great them at the door, moving on. I feel like it‚Äôs probably already fixed in more recent editions. But the reason I keep coming back and the reason I LOVE Seanan McGuire/Mira Grant is  stuff like this.This, so much this!!! What could have been a throw away plot devise character, maybe even an in joke, but isn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs real and complex and layered as anyone else. I guess it helps he was inspired by a real person, but even then, it would be easy to get lazy. It would be easy to discount him and make him be two dimensional comic relief. She didn‚Äôt. Instead I‚Äôm half in love and totally heartbroken for this guy. It‚Äôs why she‚Äôs amazing.
