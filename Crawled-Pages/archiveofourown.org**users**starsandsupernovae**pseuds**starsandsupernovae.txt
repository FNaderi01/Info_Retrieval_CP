    Summary
      Spencer Reid is all too aware of his coworker Derek Morgan, and that his feelings for him aren't quite like the ones he has for the rest of his friends. Not that he would've said anything without help from some ruined clothing, a persistent dog, and an even more persistent stalker.Derek Morgan is aware of Spencer Reid, has been since the moment he walked in and opened his mouth. He's a friend, a brilliant (and gorgeous) young prodigy. But as they work together and grow closer, Derek becomes aware of something more between them. Not that he would've said anything without some help from some destroyed property, ruined comms, and perhaps the trickiest unsub he's encountered.

    Summary
      Spencer is months away from completing his third doctorate when he receives the news he has been (impatiently) waiting for: he's been accepted into the FBI academy. But now that it's been confirmed he'll be moving across the country, Spencer suddenly realizes he won't know a single person when he arrives. On the suggestion of a classmate, Spencer goes online to find "meet up" sites, in the hope that he can make some friends before it's time to move. However, being ever 'popular culture un-savyy,' he gets the word wrong and ends up looking for "hook up" sites instead! Spencer is suddenly thrown into the world of online dating (unbeknownst to him) when he begins responding to messages from someone named "DeManding." Things quickly escalate from friendship to... something more, and Spencer finds himself knee-deep in an unknown, yet shockingly erotic, world. The only thing is... Spencer might actually kind of like it.

    Summary
      It's rare enough that anyone on the team has to take on undercover work for more than a single night, and even more uncommon that the CIA happens to be splitting a case with the FBI. So, really, Morgan shouldn't complain. But he does, and he's wholeheartedly dedicated to hating this assignment up until the damn college kid, who looks like he survives on coffee alone, bustles into the café.

    Summary
      Needless to say, Reid and Morgan are most likely in love with each other. The two show very different symptoms of such - between them AND within themselves - at times parallel, at times complementary, and others simply jarring. It just, takes the couple a little bit to put two and two together ;)Your classic slow-ish burn filtered through a specific lens(imagine this set around the second half of season 4)

    Summary
      AU. Nine-year-old Spencer Reid is brilliant, but he's too young to fully grasp the trauma threatening to bury him.

The BAU team takes on a case that ends up throwing them together, and Spencer is sent to live with Alex and her husband, and everything changes. (this is the Spencer Blake AU)
