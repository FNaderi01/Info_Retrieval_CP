  Please use this form to submit a request regarding a deceased Squarespace customer’s site. Our deepest condolences go out to you and your family during this time, and we appreciate your patience as we work through your request.
Due to privacy concerns and restrictions, we unfortunately can't provide you with administrative control of the site. However, if an immediate family member or legal representative completes the form below, we may be able to grant Billing permissions so the site can remain active or cancel any active subscriptions.
Note that Billing permissions don't include the ability to edit the site's content. You can read more about this here.
A note regarding Squarespace 5 sites:
Squarespace 5, our legacy platform, doesn't allow permissions to be edited. However, we can cancel or remove the site.

            Squarespace Select
            Last updated July 20, 2020 17:32
              Sections
            Squarespace Select is a premium plan that combines Squarespace's advanced features with dedicated support. This guide reviews what's included in the Select plan and other information that can help you decide if the Select plan is right for you.
What's included in the Select plan? 
The Select plan covers everything your business needs to excel, including:
A dedicated Account Manager who understands your business goals
Private product training
Quarterly business reviews
Design consultations
Tailored SEO support
Technical support
To learn more about these features and benefits, visit squarespace.com/select.
Is Select right for my business?
Select is a good option for medium-to-large businesses or individuals looking for ongoing, dedicated support with their site.
With Select, you’ll get personalized guidance on advanced features and specialized consultations at any stage of your site's development. Your dedicated Account Manager reviews your site quarterly, giving you insight into performance, analytics, and security. They'll also offer personalized recommendations to optimize and make the most of your site.
If you only need someone to design your site for you, Select may not be the best option. To learn more about working with an independent designer, visit Hiring a Squarespace Expert.
Pricing
For information on Select pricing and payment terms, contact the Select team. If you need a more customized plan, or if you're managing a large volume of sites, include what you need in form, and we'll help you find the right solution.
Terms and requirements
You can pay for your Select plan monthly or annually. Both options require a twelve-month commitment so your Account Manager can schedule your services appropriately.
To cancel Select or downgrade to a different plan, contact your Account Manager. Before cancelling, review our website refund policy. 
Sign up
Squarespace Select is currently in an early access phase. If you’re interested, visit squarespace.com/select to read the full plan details, then complete the form at the bottom of the page. We’ll respond within one business day.
FAQ
Can I use Select in my country?
You can sign up for Select in any country. However, the premium services included with Select are only available in English.  
Our Commerce features require connecting a supported payment processor, Stripe or PayPal, which support different countries and currencies. 
Can I use Select for multiple websites?
Select is available on a per-site basis, meaning you can sign up for Select on any site that needs an extra level of support. If you’re interested in purchasing and managing a large volume of sites, let us know when you complete the form on squarespace.com/select.
Can other people on my team use my Select benefits?
Yes. When you sign up, you can designate site contributors who can access your business’s benefits for its Select website.
