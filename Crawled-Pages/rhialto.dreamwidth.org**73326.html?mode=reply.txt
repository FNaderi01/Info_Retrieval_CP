rhialtoGrrr last  sunday night when I came back to the train station to collect my  bicycle, some (&amp;&amp;(#@$ idiot had stolen my saddle! I had to find a  bike shop open on mondays to buy a new one, and the saddle pin too...﻿What use is a loose saddle to a thief?I think that possibly this vandalism was a revenge for my bike being too well attached to the rack so they couldn't steal the whole thing...
