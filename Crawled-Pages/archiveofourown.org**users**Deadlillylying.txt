    Summary
      Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria. A place of dreams. Happiness. Laughter. But only during the day. When the sun goes down, it's a whole different story.
Mike Schmidt just wanted some extra cash so he could afford to move out of his aunt's place a little sooner. Now he's hip-deep in a horror story that's been playing itself out for over a decade. The pizzeria has has skeletons jammed into every nook and cranny, and they're about to come shambling into the light.
But this isn't the first time Mike's world has turned itself inside out, and like hell he's just going to roll over and die. If he goes down, he's taking the whole house of cards with him.
