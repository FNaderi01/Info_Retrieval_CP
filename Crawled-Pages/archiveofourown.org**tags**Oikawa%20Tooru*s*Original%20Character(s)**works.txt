    Summary
      “So you’re Karasuno’s new manager.”Ash was busy looking at the vending machine, this time even emptier than before, when his voice reached her ears. She turned her head to her right, where he was standing, a small smirk gracing his annoyingly handsome face.Oikawa Tooru.She looked back once more to the now almost familiar vending machine before answering.“No.”Her response was dry and her tone slightly rude taking into account she was talking to someone older than her, but she didn’t really like him. He was too much of a narcissist, even if he was a cute one.

This isn’t a love story.

    Summary
      Everything on the ice is called Eros. It wasn’t just attraction. Nothing that beautiful could ever be so shallow. Figure skating was art, nothing without a little bit of madness to give it character. She wants so be that one person for her in the audience amidst hundreds. She would do anything to make them smile. She wanted to be somebody to someone. Love was supposed to be warm and kind, filled to the brim with an emotion that words would never do any justice.It’s not true that Horikoshi Kira has never been in love. She was, once— no, she is, so deeply and irrevocably, but the love she felt for Oikawa Tooru was different. It wasn’t like how she imagined it to be at all. This was all-consuming and passionate, a wildfire that was going to devour her whole. She was the only one burning in this love. He seemed to be above everything, on the pedestal everyone has put him on.He can’t hear the sound of a heart breaking, or the pain it causes her when the shards dig into her skin, desperately trying to hold herself together. Sadly, she can't hear his either, but they can see each others smiles. For them, perhaps that was enough.

    Summary
      These are just some head cannons me and my friend have been talking about for months and I've been secretly writing them all down so i could surprise him. These are going to be in no particular order but i will try to keep the fandom's together as much as possible. Please let me know about any spelling mistakes, English is my first language, i'm just awful at spelling and i don't really check it as i'm going.
