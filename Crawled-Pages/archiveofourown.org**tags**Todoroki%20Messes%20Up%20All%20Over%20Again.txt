    Summary
      "Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned."Just how many times does Shoto Todoroki have to say those same words all over again...It's fairly well-known that priests have rules they can't break. He cannot marry. He cannot engage in sexual acts. He cannot abandon his flock. Beyond everything, he cannot forsake his God.All these years, Shoto, a priest, has never been terrible at obeying rules that is until Katsuki Bakugo, a criminal gang leader, who visits his church one particular night appears in his life. There are angels and demons at war in his head. He wants to stay true to his vows but it is only becoming impossible when Katsuki seeks vengeance for the unintentional offensive thing he has said and now the latter is going to show him that even priests aren't as pure as people think.The story revolving around one who follows rules and encounters who breaks them, just what could possibly go wrong? A lot. Change. Intimacy. Love. Something much deeper than that. Perhaps until Shoto struggles to resist against temptation and breaks his vow of celibacy in the altar of his own church and oh, dear Lord, he would do it again.For the sin he has committed;This is his confession.
