According to a recent Pace and USC Rossier poll, 61 percent of respondents had a positive impression of the California School Dashboard, a new website that evaluates the performance of California schools along multiple measures. Heather Hough, executive director of the research partnership between the CORE Districts and Policy Analysis for California Education, and President of the California State Board of Education Michael Kirst shared the logic behind California’s dashboard with us in our Winter 2017 forum on state accountability systems. In the same forum, Jeb Bush gave us another view on accountability metrics in his essay on Florida schools’ letter-grade system.
