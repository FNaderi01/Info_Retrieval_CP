The Nguzo Saba (The Seven Principles) were conceived and developed 55 years ago in 1965 by Dr. Maulana Karenga, professor and chair of the Department of Africana Studies, California State University, Long Beach,  executive director of the African American Cultural Center and chair of The Organization Us and the National Association of Kawaida Organizations. The Nguzo Saba in Swahili and English are Umoja (Unity), Kijichagulia (Self-determination), Ujima (Collective Work and Responsibility), Ujamaa (Cooperative Economics), Nia (Purpose), Kuumba (Creativity) and Imani (Faith).  These values are most widely known as the core values of the African American and pan-African holiday of Kwanzaa which is a celebration of family, community and culture.

Over the last fifty five years these Seven Principles have been increasingly embraced by African peoples in the United States, on the continent and throughout the global African community. An internet search using the Nguzo Saba or any of the principles brings up hundreds of thousands of entries ranging from scholarly articles and research projects, to names of organizations, institutions and individuals.
The Nguzo Saba have demonstrated practical usefulness in such varied areas as educational curricula, rites of passage and other youth programs, family and male/female relations, spirituality and ethics, economic development, political organization, creative production, principles of organizing and, physical and psychological well-being, as well as African-centered value grounding by people in their daily lives.
