    Summary
      "When Alpha youth first present they are taken from their homes and put to live in solitude alongside the mountainside.  At least she got to stay when she presented. For a little bit longer. Not that she’d have to be gone for long. But when she returned, she’d have a mate. At least, that’s what everyone around her hoped.She hoped she found no one at all."--In a society when Omegas come of age, they must go on a pilgrimage to find their exiled mates.
