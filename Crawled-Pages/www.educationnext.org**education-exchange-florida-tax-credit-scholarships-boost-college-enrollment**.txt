            The Florida Tax Credit (FTC) scholarship program is the nation’s largest private school choice program.
A new study finds that students who enroll in private schools through the FTC program are more likely to go to and graduate from college than their public school peers.
Matt Chingos talks with Paul E. Peterson about the study, “The Effects of the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program on College Enrollment and Graduation,” which he co-authored with Tomas Monarrez and Daniel Kuehn.
