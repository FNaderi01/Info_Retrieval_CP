History[edit]
This station started out as Daytimer KWBC in 1946 with a Variety/Ethnic format that comprises mostly local, amateur, and public service programming under the ownership of Associated Broadcasters.
In 1950, J. Dean McClain joined the station with his hour-long "Blues at Sunrise". program. By the late 1950s McClain was program director, and later was station manager and general manager.[1]
By 1953, most commercial billings were from Ethnic shows, so their owners reimaged the station as KNOK-AM to serve an African American audience.
By 1954, KNOK-AM changed the format to R&amp;B with Country and Spanish language programming on weekends. After 1957, KNOK-AM became a full-time R&amp;B station and was the first station in the DFW area to exclusively do so. In the late 1960s, the African American Clay Smothers, who later served in the Texas House of Representatives was the station news editor known for his conservative commentary.[2]
From 1957 to 1979, it simulcasted to its FM sister station of the same callsign. In 1979, KNOK-AM transferred its R&amp;B format to sister station KNOK-FM and changed its format to Jazz. Three years later, the station was renamed as KSAX (callsign to have stood for SAXophone) while maintaining its Jazz format before making its final switch to a Black Gospel formatted station as KHVN in 1985.
There have been rumors that KHVN 970 would be scheduled to go dark by New Year's Eve 2007 as part of the FCC's dial expansion program of 1989, in exchange for a frequency with a full day/night schedule on KKGM 1630. This move was scheduled for 1998 but Infinity/CBS Radio sold the frequency. Since Mortenson owns 970 and 1630, the divesting could feasibly still happen. As of 2018, it has not taken place.
