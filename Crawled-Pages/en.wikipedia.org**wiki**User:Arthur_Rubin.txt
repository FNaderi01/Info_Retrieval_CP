About me

My father died a few hours ago.  (My mother died in 2002.)  I'm going to be pretty busy for the next few days.  — Arthur Rubin  (talk) 10:54, 23 April 2018 (UTC)
Wiki-interests
Concur with User:Miller17CU94: if the fairness doctrine were applied to the Internet, it would be a major step toward the United States becoming a police state.  It's even more likely to happen in 2020, than in 2008, if the Democrats win in the Senate and the Presidency, as a number of new Representatives have submitted radical legislation.

Barnstars and related awards
  This editor is a Grandmaster Editor First-Class and is entitled to display this Mithril Editor Star with the Neutronium Superstar hologram.
The Barnstar of Diligence
In view of the abiding perspicacity of your always cogent contributions at WP:AfD, which have the effect not only of improving directly the project qua encyclopedia but also, inasmuch as they promote logical argumentation and civil and rational discourse, of improving indirectly the project qua evolving organism, you are surely well-deserving of this barnstar. Joe 17:22, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
The Invisible Barnstar
In addition to being a good mathematician, you are a very good user. NHRHS2010 Talk  21:42, 4 October 2007 (UTC)

The Special Barnstar
Even though the efforts to keep the Pelosi article on my user page were not successful, I am so thankful at least someone in Wikipedia other than Jimbo saw the light on this. As a result, I offer you this barnstar as a matter of thanks. Chris (talk) 19:07, 6 September 2008 (UTC)
The Sewer Cover Barnstar
You have been awarded the Sewer Cover Barnstar because you can read through anything. You don’t know the meaning of attention deficit disorder, laugh in the face of boredom, and are wasting your talents if you don’t become a patent examiner.
I award this to you, Arthur Rubin, with humbleness and awe. You’ve done what I truly can not. Further, as you read through the 1925 article, you made improvements to the article, exhibiting the best of true Wikipedian spirit. Thanks. Greg L (talk) 00:57, 8 November 2008 (UTC)

The Barnstar of Diplomacy
I saw the tirade of abuse against you on the 2010 talk page. This Barnstar is recognition to you for keeping a cool head and not rising to the user's comments. For this, I commend you. AycliffeAngel (talk) 17:05, 13 April 2010 (UTC)

The Original Barnstar
Hello Arthur. I just discovered that you were the third editor to edit my talk page, a long time ago, at the beginning of my career here. You made some very friendly suggestions regarding formatting and other stuff, with a pointer--I don't think I ever properly thanked you for it. In fact, knowing me, if I responded at all I probably did so in asshole mode. If so, my belated apologies, five years--no, six--after the fact. It's that sort of kindness on your part (and that of other editors) that countered my habitual antagonism and kept me going here and, at some disastrous point, made me believe in the project. I salute you. Drmies (talk) 04:39, 20 September 2013 (UTC)
Hello Arthur Rubin, Lionelt has given you a delicious Chick-Fil-A sammie, for your faithful service and commitment to Wikipedia! You see, these things promote WikiLove and hopefully this has made your day better. Spread the WikiLove by giving someone else a delicious Chick-Fil-A sammie!  Enjoy!
The Anti-Vandalism Barnstar
For the tedious job of reverting the hundreds of bad edits by a recent IP vandal, and for the inevitable block that came after. S806 (talk) 16:08, 5 October 2014 (UTC)
The Admin's Barnstar
