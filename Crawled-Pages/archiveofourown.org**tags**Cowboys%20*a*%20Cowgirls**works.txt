    Summary
      “You stole that. That’s the signature sequence of my favorite skater, KeKo Skates. And you just stole it, right down to the salute and everything.”“What.”“The KeKo Skates, skating extraordinaire from Texas who never shows his face, but we know he has fancy hair and always wears red jackets.”Is Keith hallucinating, or did Griffin really get someone all the way out here to pretend they knew him? It was embarrassing enough last time.The boy is still going, and Keith wonders how well Griffin paid him. “He has too many followers to count and his friend makes these super sick skating edits. You know, the KeKo Skates.”Then the boy’s face slowly turns from expectant to horrified, and Keith can tell it isn’t a joke.“Oh shit.” The boy says.And yeah, Keith would say that sums it up pretty well. OR the most self-indulgent skateboarding au written by two people who know 0 things about skating

    Summary
      Life ain’t too easy for a woman, ‘specially not a woman on the run like you. With a bounty on your head and gunpowder in your nose, you’ve grown adjusted to a life of solitude away from the hustle and bustle of civilization. 
That is, until you meet one particular man who’s got a face you’d only ever seen in your dreams – or on wanted posters. And when he offers you a proposition that sounds too good to be true, well. You don’t think your life will ever be the same again.

    Summary
      The gallows stood right outside my cell. The silent killer that put many outlaws to rest, first bed for most. Through the barred window I could see the rope swinging. Buzzards and crows ready for their taste. The crowd of the town gathered around, all anticipating the show. I'd hate to keep them waiting.Only twenty-five minutes to go.

His wife is Lena Luthor, a well respected millionaire entrepreneur, scientist and Inventor.This is the second part of their story, taking place 5 years from where "The Only Hell Mama Raised" left off.NOTE: This is Fantasy Wild West.

    Summary
      Dean almost cursed his brother for dragging him into this Halloween party just to abandon him ten minutes later for the pleasure of Jessica Moore’s company. Leaning against the bar isolated from the dance floor, he sighed, grateful to have at least some alcohol to comfort himself with. He had decided to swallow a few more drinks before going back to his apartment to watch TV when, suddenly, someone came to pull him out of his morose thoughts by bumping into him.[Suptober, day 6]

    Summary
      Dean maudissait presque son frère de l’avoir traîné dans cette fête d’Halloween simplement pour l’abandonner dix minutes plus tard pour les beaux yeux de Jessica Moore. Accoudé au bar isolé de la piste de dance, il soupira, reconnaissant d’avoir au moins de l’alcool pour se consoler. Il s’était résolu à boire encore quelques verres avant de rentrer regarder la télé dans son appartement quand, soudainement, quelqu’un vint le tirer hors de ses pensées moroses en le bousculant.[Suptober, jour 6]

    Summary
      In the early 1890s, the Van der Linde Gang were truly at their finest. Experts at stealing from the rich and giving to the poor, they've made a name for themselves across the West. Two of their newest recruits, a pair of rebellious Irish siblings with an unknown past, slowly find their footing and settle into their new lives as outlaws.And yet, as they grow older, threats from all sides begin to appear. A strained relationship with Colm O'Driscoll spells disaster for the gang, and no matter how far they roam across America, the world continues to change around them. If they want to survive, difficult choices must be made.No one is as they seem and the impending arrival of law and order threatens to tear the siblings, and everything they hold dear, apart. Is it too late for anyone to find a happy ending?
