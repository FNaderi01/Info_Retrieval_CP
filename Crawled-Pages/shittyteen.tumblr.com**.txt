        labete-du-gevaudan:This photograph supposedly features the Loch Ness Monster. Author and Loch tour guide Ricky Phillips captured the image on December 13th, 2018 around 3pm. He claimed to be only 20 feet or so away from the creature when it breached the surface of the water. Phillips stated that ‚ÄúIt was a grey creature - almost bird like - in a grey stretch of water. It‚Äôs neck was three to four feet long, a head the size of a rugby ball and a ridge across its eyes‚Äù. Because of his knowledge and history on the lake, the sighting is given more credibility with the Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings Registry.¬†
