    Summary
      Mulan: A Wuxia Musical is my conceptualization of the idea that the Disney Mulan live-action adaption could have been both more like a Chinese martial arts fantasy (wuxia film) AND a musical. If you've listened to my Chinese novel musical numbers, you''ll have an idea of where I'm going with this. Piano &amp; vocals concepts for reimagined versions of:"Honor to Us All," "I'll Make a Man Out of You," and "Reflection."

    Summary
      Jingyan's arranged marriage would have rended her from Lin Shu. Which was of course unacceptable. So Lin Shu arranged Jingyan another marriage—to her, and to their husband,  a jianghu doctor of little status the Young Master of Lang Ya Hall. The Emperor really should have known better than to promise his seventh daughter to Southern Chu.
