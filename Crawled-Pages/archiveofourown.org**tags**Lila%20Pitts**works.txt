    Summary
      As he fell to his knees, one arm still wrapped around the Horror as if that could contain it, he clawed at the board until it budged. And when it did, he flipped to the back, uncapped the pen with his teeth, and scribbled it down as fast as possible.
How to Help My Siblings (and Maybe Stop the Apocalypse)- Stop Five from time traveling- Help Vanya learn how to use her powers- Tell Vanya she has powers (??)- Help Klaus curb his addiction before it gets out of control- Spend time with Luther, Allison, Diego- Stand up to Dad- don’t die this time
---
Time traveling has never made sense, and Ben is the only one sent back in time after the first apocalypse.

    Summary
      A job from the timelords prompts the TARDIS team to search for answers to a temporal anomaly. So as Ace and the Doctor depart to a day they saw 11 years ago from the other side of the world, Five gets some help in 1963 from the unlikely duo- and even more. Sometimes a couple extra pairs of hands can help round up your siblings to stop the end of the world- or get in the way.

    Summary
      While trying to jump across dimensions, Five Hargreeves gets “Fractured”, a rare side effect of frequent time travel that splits the host into fragments of a full person that need to be put back together like a sad puzzle. If the traveller was lucky, they would split into a couple of parts; they might even be able to put themselves back together as quickly as it happens, avoiding all the emotional moments and touchy subjects that follow.Of course, Five was never that lucky. He gets split into too many pieces and it's up to the rest of the Umbrella Academy to put him back together.

    Summary
      Trapped and scattered across Dallas in the early 60s, the Hargreeves siblings have to gather up and prepare themselves to stop yet another doomsday scenario. But being stuck in a time they don't belong in proves to present more problems than previously assumed, and they may find ripple effects are easier to create than they are to fix.

    Summary
      Fiddling with his empty holster, (he felt strangely vulnerable without his knives), Diego wondered what had happened to the rest of his siblings. Part of him hoped that they had made it out of the Icarus Theatre alive, crashing somewhere else in Dallas, but a larger part of him was doubtful. He didn’t understand how time travel worked exactly but Five hadn’t mentioned anything about them potentially being separated from each other. If it was a possibility, wouldn't he have mentioned it? It was hard not to assume the worst. “Yeah, we’ve picked up the nutcase from 1026 North Beckley Street,” One of the officers, the one lounging in the passenger seat, chuckled into his radio, “Reckons he’s saved the president’s life. Better get someone from Shinyview down at the station.” -Diego Hargreeves spent 75 days in a mental institution before he escaped. This is what happened. Canon compliant!

    Summary
      Five thought he'd saved the world not once but twice and earned himself a happy retirement back in 2019 where he belonged. Evidently, that was not to be the case when he returned to find none other than the Sparrow Academy in his very own home, replacing him and his siblings spots under Reginald Hargreaves's care. For the first time in his life Five finds someone who actually challenges him and makes him question himself every day- the Sparrow Academy's Number Five, Myra.

    Summary
      The 58-year-old man trapped in his 13-year-old body froze in place, eyes glued to the scene in front of him, slowly lowering the gun he was holding. Klaus was on his knees on the asphalt, his green eyes wide open to Five, Handler's hand encased in his brown hair, the gun in his temple. The Handler disabled the security lock with one click and looked at Five."So, Number Five, what's gonna be? " Or The handler remembers who Five really is on S1 E5 and her plans change.

    Summary
      “So you’re going to… What? Just start refusing to go on missions?” Luther’s eyes flicker from Allison to Vanya, and she knows that the question that he’s not asking is ‘And in that case, why is she even here?’Vanya takes a deep breath and Allison starts to say ‘I heard a rumor that you got through this conversation without crying’ (because respect for Ben is one thing but Allison’s not Ben, she doesn’t have his patience, his accepting nature, she is not and has never aspired to be nice in the way he was) but Vanya surprises everyone by saying, “No. Not refusing to go, just getting out.” Everyone’s looking at Vanya now, so Allison does her the favour of shifting their attention away from her. “Yeah. Vanya’s got it. That’s exactly it.”OROn the day of the funeral Reginald Hargreeves cancels training out of respect for Number Six.Allison uses that time to think about what respect for Ben looks like and draws her own conclusions about how to ensure that there never is a next time.

    Summary
      My VERY first work on AO3! Also my VERY FIRST Umbrella Academy fic. Major warning: IT'S A SLOOOOW BURN. Like you have no idea, how much we'll go through. However, it is also an adventure of your character, their interactions with each of the siblings, although main focus on Five and Diego. To clarify, Diego someone the character is romantically interested in, and with Five it's a platonic friendship. I do not want to give any spoilers away; the first few (of, hopefully, many) chapters will relate (HOWEVER, not gonna be identical TO) Season 2 of Umbrella Academy and later chapters will be somewhat of what I'd like to imagine would follow in the other seasons (Which it won't obviously lol). Please comment, let me know what you think. If you got any ideas, or something you'd think would fit perfectly with the story, lemme know! Toodles!

    Summary
      Vanya was Five’s. Everyone knew that. Everyone knew that he didn’t like sharing- a horrible habit he had developed as a young child. He never liked to share his toys and it was no surprise that he didn’t like sharing his favorite one. Vanya was his and his alone.

      After the temporary disasters created by the Hargreeves siblings, what would happen if one person could save the whole story?
A mysterious girl decides to help by going back to the beginning of time, before Five disappeared, before the first apocalypse.
The mysterious woman is more special than they originally expected, but above all, the most surprising thing is to discover who she is.
