It's only been two months since I was last here, I'm improving!Anyway, books!Mostly I am back to reading the Foreigner series. after a long gap over the summer. I'm up to book eight now, Pretender, and they continue to be excellent. Cherryh's worldbuilding is amazing, to the point where I actually gasped over one character calling a different character by a certain honorific, because the implications of that were a) big, and b) something that I understood because her world and her societies and her characters are so complete. I am constantly delighted by these books, they are so good. ( Spoileriness )I do have several library ebooks that have just come in, including Jeannette Ng's Under the Pendulum Sun, so it's probably time for a shift in gears for a bit.
