    Summary
      Y/N Y/L/N is eager and honestly, still in awe that she managed to get herself an acceptance from Stanford Law School. On the face of it, her life seems as put together, mysterious and independent as one might hope for. On the insides, she carries the burden of past that haunts her till date. Seemingly, she’d left it all behind; that is until she sets foot in the class of the Law School’s youngest, most promising professor.

    Summary
      Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson are the best lawyers at Washington &amp; Adams. When they're paired to work on a very important case together will they be able to get along? Basically Washington makes them work together on a case to keep Lafayette in the country? Good old fashioned enemies to lovers with a bunch of miscommunication. Most of the legal stuff will be incorrect, but I'll try to be respectful about it. I suck at summaries, but I would appreciate it if you would read. Adding tags as I go bc I'm bad at tagging.

    Summary
      So Castiel isn't the most - moral? Conventional? Call it what you like - attorney, but fuck if he isn't one of the best in the state of California. He's gone up against lawyers from all over and only lost a handful of cases in twenty years. So when a young up-and-comer beats him in a case he should have bagged, of course he's interested. But he wasn't expecting this.

      "She had no shortage of validation these days. Hell, it was probably the mortification of her exit from Runway that had fueled her magna cum laude from Harvard law, and the subsequent appointment at Pearson Hardman. Her job was to win, so she won. Frequently. This would be no different. And if Miranda saw her do it—well. Icing on the cake. "*updated with some edits after two excellent beta reads!!!*

    Summary
      Lindsay Jones keeps her nails sharp.To someone who finds out from an accidental, or an "accidental" catch on their clothes or their hair or their skin, she apologizes casually, and the apology is always accepted. Who would sharpen their nails on purpose? Of course, it's just that they're getting long, or that they happened to be trimmed to that shape, or that it was done for aesthetics.But to one man, she gives a different answer.

    Summary
      “Julian, criminal justice isn’t your field of expertise.”“I know, I know, but I’ve been stuck doing the boring civil stuff,” Jaskier doesn’t allow the whine to sneak into his voice, but he sees Geralt smirk from the corner of his eye. Bastard. “I’ve done enough criminal cases that it would be gratuitous to keep me off this because I haven’t got much experience with murder necessarily. Besides, I need this excitement in my life lest I decide to stab someone out of boredom myself. That someone, might I add, regretfully being your insolent son. Let me do it, please.”OR alternatively: the one where they’re all lawyers who are just a tiny bit more competent than one would expect.
