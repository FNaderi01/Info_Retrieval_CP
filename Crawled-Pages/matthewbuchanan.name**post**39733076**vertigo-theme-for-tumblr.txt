About the authorI’m a designer and practitioner of fine typography in Auckland, New Zealand. I co-founded a design and development studio, Cactuslab, in 2001, and a social network for film fans, Letterboxd, in 2011. I design themes for Tumblr, speak occasionally about web techniques and typography, and think up reasons to visit New York City.Portrait by Photobooth SF, June 2013DribbbleFlickrGithubInstagramLast.fm -->LetterboxdPinboardQuoraSpeaker DeckSpotifyTwitterVimeoMatthew BuchananAboutArchiveColophonPosted on Wednesday, 25 June 2008Vertigo Theme for TumblrJakob’s orange crocs may have stolen my thunder here a little, but if you’re still reading, I made a Tumblr theme called Vertigo that’s also orange. Luckily for you it supports custom colours, so you can change the orange to something else. I’ve released it under Creative Commons so you’re free to make derivative works, with some provisos. If you use it, drop me a line and let me know.Edit: Wow, that was quick! Also: fixed a minor cut-and-paste issue that resulted in an error with the permalink on the little “atom” icon, grab the theme file again if it bothers you.Jun 25, 2008836 notesLike ~ Reblog
