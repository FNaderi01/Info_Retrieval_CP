The modes of transport in Iceland are governed by the country's rugged terrain and sparse population. The principal mode of personal transport is the car. There are no public railways, although there are bus services. Transport from one major town to another, for example Reykjavík to Akureyri, may be by aeroplane on a domestic flight. The only ways of getting in and out of the country are by air and sea. Most of the country's transport infrastructure is concentrated near the Capital Region, which is home to two thirds of the country's population.

Rail[edit]
Main article: Rail transport in Iceland
Iceland has no public railways, although proposals to build a passenger line between Keflavík and Reykjavík have been made as well as proposals to build a light rail system in Reykjavík.[1]
In the past, locomotive-powered and hand-operated rails have been temporarily set up during certain construction projects, and have long since been dismantled. Some artifacts from their existence remains in museums and as static exhibits.
Road[edit]
Main article: Roads in Iceland
  Road across Eyjafjörður in northern Iceland from the western exit of the Öxnadalsheiði pass
  The Ring Road of Iceland and some towns it passes through:  1.Reykjavík, 2.Borgarnes, 3.Blönduós, 4.Akureyri, 5.Egilsstaðir, 6.Höfn, 7.Selfoss
Iceland has 12,869 kilometres (7,996 mi) of publicly administered roads, 5,040 kilometres (3,130 mi) of which are paved.[2] Organized road building began about 1900 and has greatly expanded since 1980. Vegagerðin (Icelandic Roads Administration) is the legal owner and constructor of the roads, and oversees and maintains them as well. 11.4% of passenger-kilometres are by bus and 88.6% by car.[3]
Sea[edit]
The major harbours in Iceland are:
Akureyri
Hornafjördur
Ísafjörður
Keflavík
Raufarhöfn
Reykjavík
Seyðisfjörður
Straumsvík
Vestmannaeyjar
Merchant marine:
total:
3 ships (with a tonnage of 1,000gt or over) totaling 13,085gt/16,938 tonnes deadweight (DWT)
ships by type:
chemical tanker 1, container ship 1, petroleum tanker 1 (1999 est.)
Transport ferries:
The only habitable islands around Iceland are supplied and infrastructurally connected with the mainland via ferries which run regularly. Those islands are:
Vestmannaeyjar The largest and most populated island.
Hrísey In the middle of Eyjafjörður in northern Iceland.
Grímsey An island in the far-north, the northernmost part of Iceland.
Those ferries are considered part of the infrastructure system such as roads, and are therefore run by Vegagerðin like the roads.
