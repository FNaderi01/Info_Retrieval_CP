    Summary
      Derek has had enough.Stiles and Scott, whoever they meant to be to him, were hiding something, lying to him—more than they had already lied to him.Hadn’t his so-called older-self—and he still wants to cry bullshit, still wants to insist that this is some fucked up nightmare or some cruel joke, that his family weren’t dead, that his house wasn’t just wood and ashes—ever tell them that it was impossible to lie to a werewolf?So, the moment he is alone with Stiles, away from Agent McCall—and what type of Alpha leaves a human packmate with a foreign wolf?—he moves, slamming him against the door.He’s going to demand answers, a growl a few threats Uncle Peter had taught him and the added growl that he practised with Laura, that Derek made a mistake—he breathed in.

    Summary
  Chris had warned him.  Chris-mother-fucking-Argent had warned him, and he still hadn’t managed to avoid the hunters.  Well, that wasn’t exactly true… he could have avoided them, but that would have meant leading them back to their base, and he wasn’t doing that.
Derek is trapped by hunters, drugged, feral...  and afraid he's going to be set free to take the one thing he's wanted more than anything else in his world: Stiles.

    Summary
      Stiles is reaching out before he can think things through. His fingers trace the hardened line of the man’s shifted face.“I wish you didn’t have these,” he says running a fingertip over Derek’s canines. So I could kiss you. The words get stuck in his throat and for once he stops them before they can leave his mouth.OR Stiles finds a feral werewolf in the Hale house the summer before he goes to college.

    Summary
      - А что? Очень удобно. Он не дуется постоянно, не встречается со всякими уродами, не шныряет по жутким, антисанитарным развалинам. Все еще немного параноик, но тут уж ничего не поделаешь. По крайней мере, сейчас гораздо проще иметь с ним дело - можно заполучить его благосклонность просто почесав за ушами.- И ты всегда хотел собаку, - сухо говорит шериф.- И я всегда хотел собаку.

    Summary
      Derek has never been particularly forthcoming with his words and it wouldn't be the first time he's gone off grid with no explanation. Still, they're friends now which means Stiles is going to worry about him, even if the rest of the pack just brush it off as Derek being... Derek. 
But is there something more malicious at play here? And can they figure out what's going on before it's too late.

    Summary
      All they needed was the fancy mythical flower to heal Lydia from the poison some asshole vampire gave her. The jackass had tricked her on a fake date and then poisoned Lydia while they were on said date, the guy went on a rant about how he was going to destroy the Hale pack once and for all and then take the Alphas power. It was a long and annoying rant and they found out the only antidote for the poison was in the Fae Realm. So of course they sent Derek and Stiles to go and retrieve it-well they sent Derek, but Stiles didn’t trust the man’s conversation skills to save them and came along much to his Alpha’s dislike.All of that led to the inevitable dickery of the Fae Queen who was having Derek...sniff a flower.Yeah, that sounded like a lot of bull.

    Summary
      "The Beast is said to live in the burnt-out husk of the Hale house." Lydia's tone was low and ominous, eyes alight with glee at the frightened glances she was getting from the others. "It's big, bigger than a bear and faster then human eyes can track." Stiles felt a shiver rattle down his spine at the image her whispered words created. Her gaze paused on him for a moment, as if sensing how unsettled her tale had made him."Not even the Enforcers can kill it, it has no weaknesses." She sat back, nonchalantly fiddling with her flashlight for a moment. "And it said to have gotten a taste for human flesh, people have been going missing more frequently ever since it arrived." She seemed entranced by her own narrative, staring at the softly crackling bonfire with vacant eyes. "No one who's went snooping around the Hale house has ever returned, they're just...gone."
