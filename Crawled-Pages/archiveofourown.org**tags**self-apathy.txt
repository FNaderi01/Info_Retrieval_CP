    Summary
      Still blindly following Clave orders, Alec infuriates Magnus and gets kicked out of the loft.  Magnus nurses his emotional wounds and Dot shows up. Lots of vodka, emotional upheaval, and recently compromised state with Azazael lead the doorway open for an unwelcome visit from one of Magnus's many uncles, A Prince of Hell, Greater Demon Samael -- with a personal agenda against Magnus and everything he holds dear.  Alec unwittingly gets caught in the middle. This doesn't bode well for either of them in the (tumultous) aftermath.Canon divergent season 2 episode 13CHAPTER 20 UPDATED
