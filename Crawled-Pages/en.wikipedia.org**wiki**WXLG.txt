North Country Public Radio is a National Public Radio member regional radio network headquartered in Canton, New York. The member-supported network is owned by St. Lawrence University and is the NPR member for the Adirondack North Country region of northern New York.   Its studios are located in the Noble Medical Building on the SLU campus.
The flagship station, WSLU in Canton, signed on for the first time on March 7, 1968.[1][2] It was a charter member of NPR.[2] It adopted the on-air name North Country Public Radio in 1984.[1] In the same year, it built the first of several low-powered translators;[1][2] much of the surrounding area was among the few areas of the Northeastern United States that was still without public radio. Its first full-powered repeaters, WSLO in Malone and WSLL in Saranac Lake began broadcasting in 1989, with additional stations signing on in the early 1990s.[2]
It now comprises 15 full-power FM transmitters and 18 low-powered translators serving the North Country, parts of western Vermont and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec with regional and national news, public affairs programs, and an eclectic variety of music.[3][4] Major cities in its coverage area are Watertown, Plattsburgh, and Glens Falls in New York, as well as Burlington, Vermont.[3]
In May 2011, North Country Public Radio also launched WREM, a radio station in Canton which offers a distinct program schedule sourced from Public Radio Exchange.[5]
