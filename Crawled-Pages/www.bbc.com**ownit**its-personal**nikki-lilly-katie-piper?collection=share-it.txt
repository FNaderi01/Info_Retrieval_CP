        How to deal with social media anxiety
        Nikki Lilly and Katie Piper discuss one of the major problems with social media - feeling like you’re not good enough. When you’re constantly seeing "perfect posts", how do you stop yourself comparing your life with others’?
        We asked an expert.
        Why do other peoples' social media accounts make me feel bad?
          When looking at other people’s pictures, it can be easy to think they’re all doing great and you’re the only one that worries about how you look or feel. The thing is, everyone feels like that now and then – you just can’t tell that by only looking at their social media.
          People tend to put their best selves forward and often hide all their other insecure parts. This can give the rest of us the impression that we’re the only ones who feel this way. It’s just not true!
        Why do people always look good on social media?
          It’s super important to remember that social media platforms like Instagram are about image. Many famous people’s feeds are promotional. This means they get paid for making products look good. 
Photos can also be messed around with. People can be made slimmer, skin can seem smoother, and body parts can get bigger and smaller! So remember, often you could be comparing yourself to something impossible. Check out Katie Thistleton's selfie-editing experiment to find out more on this.
        What should I do if I feel bad?
          If you find yourself feeling low, talk it over with someone you trust. If that’s a friend, you’re likely to find out that they sometimes feel the same way, which will help you feel like it’s not just happening to you.

          Talking to a trusted adult who knows you well can also help. It’s important to speak about the things we feel insecure about to someone who sees us as the great people we are.
        What else can I do?
          If you're beginning to feel this way, how about taking a break from social media or if you don’t want to come off it, you might want to access it less. Check in with how it makes you feel when you do log in. If it feels bad, it makes sense to log in less, doesn’t it?
