    Summary
      This story delves into the mystery of where the HELL Maya Fey and Miles Edgeworth were when Phoenix Wright's world collapsed around him post disbarment and WHY they weren't at his side during Phoenix's darkest hour for those long seven years. Join Phoenix, Maya, Miles, Franziska and the rest of your favourite Ace Attorney characters for nearly a decade and experience with them both their laughter and tears, as they discover life's bittersweet truths: sometimes love isn't enough to mean happily ever after, all the money in the world can't necessarily fix all tragedies, justice doesn't always prevail, and broken hearts heal...but can they ever truly mend? Follows the Ace Attorney Timeline for the most part and goes through AJ to Post DD. Slight spoilers for all games. This is the final installment of the Turnabout Lawful Love Trilogy and takes place right where Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman ended. The story starts pre-Apollo Justice, right before Phoenix's disbarment. Official part 3 of the Turnabout Lawful Love Trilogy.

    Summary
      A chance encounter on a northbound train leads Professor Layton and his young friend Luke to once again team up with the hapless lawyer Phoenix Wright, now accompanied by his sweet little daughter Trucy. At first, the Professor's latest mystery seems like a straightforward missing persons case, but after arriving in the haunted village of Fatargan, Layton and Phoenix soon realise that if they ever hope to make it out of here, they'll have to understand the village, its people, and each other.

    Summary
      State of California v. Wright, round three.This time, without any complications or legal miracles. There was one key difference — this time, Phoenix knew that he was guilty. Much to Phoenix's dismay, the State of California happens to be full of people who love him.

    Summary
      During the seven years Phoenix Wright spends in disbarment, Kristoph Gavin seems to hold the world in the palm of his hand. From Europe, Miles Edgeworth watches and tries to help as Phoenix struggles to pry himself away from Kristoph's grip.OR: A look at how Kristoph's twisted system of manipulation reaches a painstakingly slow end, and the catharsis of when it's finally over.Set intermittently from before AJ to after, with some reference to the later games.

    Summary
       “Have you ever heard the phrase ‘The Dark Age of the Law’ before?”
Phoenix can’t help it, he laughs. “Have I…? I thought I am the dark age of the law. Or at least that’s what the papers are saying.”
“And you know I never believed in that.” Edgeworth says, and his voice is soft enough to bruise. 
A story about how Athena meets the Wrights, Edgeworth finally decides to have a conversation about feelings, and Phoenix gets his groove back.

    Summary
      “I admit I killed Shadi Smith. Seeing as I’m going to prison anyway, why not let you all in on a little secret?”“Mr. Gavin?”“There was a piece of forged evidence presented in today’s trial, and I have proof.”  When Apollo Justice decides to use the bloody ace to put his mentor in jail, it doesn't come without consequences. Luckily, those consequences aren't all for him.
