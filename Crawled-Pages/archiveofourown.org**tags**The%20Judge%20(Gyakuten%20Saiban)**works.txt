    Summary
      When Apollo suddenly gains the ability to witness musical numbers depicting the troubles and emotions of people around him, this only complicates getting Phoenix Wright's case dumped onto his lap, and everything beyond that.(Or, Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney if Apollo had another, weirder superpower.)

    Summary
      When a legal conference at a remote resort is hit with a blizzard, a power outage, and a murder all on the same night, it’s up to our favorite attorneys to get to the truth of things while battling their own inner turmoil and unnecessary feelings. Wonder how that’s gonna turn out.

    Summary
      This story delves into the mystery of where the HELL Maya Fey and Miles Edgeworth were when Phoenix Wright's world collapsed around him post disbarment and WHY they weren't at his side during Phoenix's darkest hour for those long seven years. Join Phoenix, Maya, Miles, Franziska and the rest of your favourite Ace Attorney characters for nearly a decade and experience with them both their laughter and tears, as they discover life's bittersweet truths: sometimes love isn't enough to mean happily ever after, all the money in the world can't necessarily fix all tragedies, justice doesn't always prevail, and broken hearts heal...but can they ever truly mend? Follows the Ace Attorney Timeline for the most part and goes through AJ to Post DD. Slight spoilers for all games. This is the final installment of the Turnabout Lawful Love Trilogy and takes place right where Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman ended. The story starts pre-Apollo Justice, right before Phoenix's disbarment. Official part 3 of the Turnabout Lawful Love Trilogy.

    Summary
      One week before Halloween, a florist is murdered in her own shop. All suspicions fall on Gilda Lily, Phoenix's latest client. Taking on this case results in a sexual awakening for both Phoenix and Miles, uncovering the mystery of the flower shop's bestselling bouquet, and putting together a 20 year old love story. Can Phoenix find the true culprit of this murder and prove his client innocent or will the near constant arousal he gets from his boyfriend be a detriment to the case?

    Summary
      Apollo Justice lives in a modest apartment with his three roommates: Aaron, Jeb, and Jackson. But when a fire breaks out in a nearby building and Jackson is convicted for the crime, the three of them find themselves taking in one of those who were displaced in the fire, namely, Simon Blackquill. But when Apollo and Simon find that rooming together equates more frequent visits from Juniper and Athena respectively, they quickly warm up to the arrangement. As Athena and Simon struggle to come to terms with their feelings for each other and Juniper and Apollo get too busy falling over themselves to consciously flirt with each other, the four of them engage in awkward alliances with each other to win their respective love interests over. Hijinks ensue.

    Summary
      A collection of my short minifills, drabbles, and artfills for the PW kink meme. Characters and genres vary. Some are serious or heartwarming, but the majority is full of crack - sometimes to the point of being fanfictional crystal meth.
  I had to bump the rating from T to M because it's starting to get a bit too risque for a "T" rating.

    Summary
      Self insert, AU. I get pulled into the Ace Attorney universe with the assignment of saving Phoenix Wright's badge. But of course in order to do that, I gotta blend in, train myself in the art of law, and most importantly not die. What I think will be a simple chore, turns into one hell of a trip. The only guide I get is a ghost who occasionally pops up through a piece of rock; I'd much rather prefer a walkthrough. Evil lawyers, psychotic killers, colorful characters...and the fact that I am now a prosecutor who doesn't know a thing about prosecuting, is enough to make my head implode. Will I save Wright's badge and make it out of here in one piece? How badly can I screw this up?
