    Summary
      It is a little known fact of Middle Earth that Hobbits shall save the world. Hobbits from the Took clan, if we are going to be precise, and whenever a wizard is involved, it always pays to be precise.The problem is that if Tooks are required to save the world, then the world requires Tooks. So every Took lass is encouraged to marry so they can set about making MORE Tooks. And that? That is something that Bella Baggins is not at all interested in. Babies, yes, because who can resist those? But until she finds a hobbit lad she finds appealing, she is perfectly content to wait, and perhaps go on an adventure or two.Bella, however, is more important than she realizes, and before she knows it, she will be battling Trolls and orcs, conversing with Elves, and charming one grouchy, exceedingly bossy dwarf with sad eyes and far too many muscles. Whom she may have, quite accidentally, ended up married to.(Edited to reflect story as it progresses)

    Summary
      Trevor Belmont, last of the Belmont line, goes to sleep in what was formerly Dracula's castle, on top of his half-vampire boyfriend and full blooded Speaker girlfriend. He wakes up in the middle of a fight, in a world where the Belmonts were never excommunicated and Lisa never burned. Occupying the trousers of Trevor Belmont, second in the line of Belmont succession, respected monster hunter (at least until he can figure out what happened) wouldn't be so bad - if it wasn't for the fact that he's supposed to be hunting down Dracula. And then there's the matter of what happened to the /other/ Trevor Belmont...

    Summary
      Ed had thought, after the whole Promised Day, homunculus, entire country harvested for alchemical batteries thing, the batshit quotient of his life would have settled down some. He really ought to have topped out the meter with that one. But no. The bullshit is just getting started. “Are you fucking kidding me,” Ed demands. “The wizards?” Podfic &amp; Chinese translation available! See notes
