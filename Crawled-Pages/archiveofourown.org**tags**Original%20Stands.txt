    Summary
      After leaving school one day Ibuki experienced a strange event that she couldn't remember, much less explain. Fast Forward a few years and she is one of the newest students at Hope's Peak Academy. With a group of friends, contacts in the yakuza, and even a fledgling band forming under her leadership things couldn't be going much better. That is, until the event from her past comes back into her life, memories and all. Who had she run into that day? What exactly did they want? What the hell is a stand, anyway? More importantly; who thought it was a good idea to let her name her own?

    Summary
      Kris was unsure when he first noticed the teal-haired, ashen-skinned being in black armor that followed him everywhere, or why they shared the same crest on their right palms. What he did know, though, was that he was unique. It was his Guardian Angel.Frisk was sure that her ability was unlike most. It was a pack of mechanical wolves for god’s sake! How cool was that?! She wasn’t sure why they followed her though. It was as if they were a part of her...Noelle had obtained her ability during an archery contest if memory served. She had assumed it was a lucky shot. There was no way she could have hit the bullseye with the wind being as strong as it was. But on later reflection, she could have sworn she felt something steadying her aim.Susie still wasn’t sure why the thing in the red dress followed her. Nobody else could see it either, so they assumed she was lying. But, then she met Kris. He had an ability just like it, at least in terms of how weird it was. It almost looked like a demon, with those gold eyes it had. He had given it a name too. “What’s the name?” She asked.“The Edge of Dawn.” He responded.

    Summary
      It's 1993 and the Stand users from the Dio incident are still scattered and in hiding. New York City is a big place, with lots of people, and its own group of Stand users. The only problem: where there are Stand users, there are usually Stand battles. The women of Informer Co. do their best to deal with all of the supernatural happenings in the area without hurting the general public. They're a small group, but they're willing to work as a team (most of the time).  
It's Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, just without a Jojo, and with lots more ladies. Yes, it will be ridiculous. No, we will not apologize.
