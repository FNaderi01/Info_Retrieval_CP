    Summary
      Carrying an alien baby inside his stomach is something Chuuya has gotten used to as the months passed him by. His stomach barely grew, and the cravings were not at all as monstrous as some pregnant human women. All in all, he's fine and dandy and more than ready to have this baby.He really shouldn't have expected for things to go as smoothly as he initially thought.(or, Chuuya lays an egg)

    Summary
      “Maybe,” Dazai purrs, fingers brushing softly against the little blue ribbon that keeps Chuuya’s hair in place. “Maybe Chuuya is my something blue. What do you think, chibi? Now I just need something borrowed—”“Shut the fuck up,” Chuuya hisses.Ane-San was so right. “Do you want something borrowed, Dazai? Then it’s your fucking lucky day because we are on borrowed time. And unless you do something about it, it’s gonna end very soon.”[Dazai is about to marry a girl Mori has picked for him - a girl Dazai might even like if he tries hard enough.Problem is, he never imagined he could fall for his wedding planner.]

    Summary
      [ HighSchool AU ]  It seems like a chance meeting in a school library but Dazai had already predicted everything.Or:How to flirt with the guy you like by Dazai Osamu.  [ When their gazes meet, Dazai spots that behind the lenses he hides sparkling blue eyes, deep as the ocean and clear as a summer sky. And leaving them, returning to the letters of his book - or rather, his nap - now seems like a divine punishment."Who are you, a creep?" The redhead adjusts his glasses to his nose with the tip of his forefinger and turns a questioning look around; the blue that for a fragment of time has given off so much peaceful now resembles a stormy sea."Maybe." "Maybe?!" the tone rises up and is enriched with a note of frustration. "You're not even from this school, why are you here?"]
