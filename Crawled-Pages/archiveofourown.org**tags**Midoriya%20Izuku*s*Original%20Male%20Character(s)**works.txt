    Summary
      In which Akihiko wants more than anything else to follow the footsteps of his pro-hero parents. If he manages to catch the eye of his crush along the way then that's just a bonus.
Or alternatively, in which Akihiko Maeda is a force to be reckoned with, Ochako Uraraka turns into a fujoshi and Izuku Midoriya falls in love.

    Summary
      Star light, Star brightI wish to see a star tonightI wish I may, I wish I mightHave the wish I wish tonight.═══⇛⪼𝔅𝔎𝔇𝔎⪻⇚═══Imagine waking up one day and realising that your eyesight is gone. In such a situation, what would you do or more likely, how would you feel?Izuku Midoriya is an Omega who had lost his vision due to complications during a rogue attack.As a consequence of this, he was forced to leave his home in hopes that he could get treatment for this issue, leaving his childhood best friend behind.Katsuki Bakugo is the Superior Alpha of a known pack. He's fierce and allows nothing to slow him down.Sadly, he had lost his mate and ever since, he had been dealing with the withdrawal of losing his partner. This only seemed to cause the Alpha to shut down, making him known as one of the most cold-hearted Alphas that one could ever come across.What will happen when the Alpha's childhood friend makes an appearance again? Especially, when the Alpha is given a second chance of having a fated mate?NB:// Izuku has a love interest at the beginning that is an original character. However, the endgame is BakuDeku.*Posted on Wattpad - JustForTheFanfic*
