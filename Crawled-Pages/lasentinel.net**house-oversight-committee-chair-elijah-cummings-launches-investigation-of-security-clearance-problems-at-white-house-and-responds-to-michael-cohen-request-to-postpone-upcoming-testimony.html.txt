House Oversight Committee Chair Elijah Cummings Launches Investigation of Security Clearance Problems at White House and Responds to Michael Cohen Request to Postpone Upcoming Testimony            
				By Sentinel News Wire                
	                	                Published January 23, 2019
Washington, D.C. – Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, the Chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, announced a wide-ranging investigation into grave breaches with the security clearance process at the White House and the Transition Team.  In a letter to the White House requesting a broad range of documents.
Cummings next teamed up with  Rep. Adam Schiff, the Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement in response to a request received by Michael Cohen to postpone his upcoming testimony before Congress:
“We understand that Mr. Cohen’s wife and other family members fear for their safety after these attacks, and we have repeatedly offered our assistance to work with law enforcement to enhance security measures for Mr. Cohen and his family.
“Nevertheless, when our Committees began discussions with Mr. Cohen’s attorney, not appearing before Congress was never an option.  We will not let the President’s tactics prevent Congress from fulfilling our constitutionally mandated oversight responsibilities.  This will not stop us from getting to the truth.  We expect Mr. Cohen to appear before both Committees, and we remain engaged with his counsel about his upcoming appearances.”
