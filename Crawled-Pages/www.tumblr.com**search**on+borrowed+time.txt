And perhaps they weren‚Äôt simply decorative but something more ‚Äì like Fenris‚Äô tattoos. It would not be the first or last time Tevinter¬†‚Äúborrowed‚Äù knowledge from the ancient elves.¬†[source][source]This would also not be the first time that Mythal‚Äôs powers or symbols have some connection to things below the surface. I originally thought Solas‚Äô new ability to turn people to stone was just something any mage with sufficient power could do. But then I saw someone point out that perhaps this was an intentional choice on the part of the writers ‚Äì to connect Mythal and the earth/the Stone. If Mythal‚Äôs markings are actually modelled after raw lyrium, I am getting the sense that there‚Äôs even more to Mythal‚Äôs connection to the dwarves/the Stone than we currently know - beyond killing Titans, beyond warring with the dwarves.¬†

            If Harry had gotten a less conventional, but more loving adoptive family...        
Dear
Minerva,
	Thank
you so much for your kind letter of the 17th. It is always a pleasure
to hear from you. I do appreciate your waiving the rules about
familiars to allow Wednesday to bring little Homer - she dotes on
that spider, and I don‚Äôt think she could consider Hogwarts home
without his company. 
	We
were delighted but completely unsurprised by the children‚Äôs Sorting.
Of course Wednesday is a Ravenclaw - she has always had a brilliant
mind, and it is rather traditional for the women in our
family. Slytherin might have been a possibility, with her cleverness
and ambition, but sadly (and quietly, between friends) I must admit
the wrong sort have rather taken over that House at the moment. Death
Eaters are so vulgar. Gomez, naturally, is over the moon about
our little Harry being a fellow Gryffindor - the world does need more
dashing, brave, and reckless men. They make life so interesting for
the rest of us, don‚Äôt you agree? And I am certain he will be safe
under your care, after his rather difficult start in life, poor
child. That aunt and uncle of his are just too terribly common to
protect him adequately - I am grateful Albus saw sense and left him
with us rather than her. 
	I
appreciate your bringing to my attention the small difficulty between
Harry and Draco - I shall have a word with Narcissa. (Lucius is still
being terribly silly about that little peacock incident, and refuses
to speak to Gomez at all. Men can be so ridiculously proud. And they
really did look so much better in black.) Really, though, Harry was
only defending his friend. I probably should warn you that Wednesday
writes that she is teaching young Longbottom a few of her more subtle
defenses - I sincerely doubt Draco will trouble him in future if he
uses those. I assure you, none of them cause permanent damage, only
temporary discomfort, and she is well aware that they are only for
self-defense, not mere childish aggression. Addamses do not start
fights, but we do finish them, and Wednesday has always looked out
for her brothers. 
	At
least that little incident allowed you to see Harry‚Äôs flying skills
in time to recruit him for the Quidditch team. I think he shall be an
excellent Seeker - he was always the best at bat-spotting on summer
evenings, and then there was the time he ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù Gomez‚Äôs
broom to rescue Pugsley‚Äôs pet octopus Aristotle, who had developed an
unaccountable taste for tree-climbing, but had neglected to learn how
to climb down. It was a successful rescue, even though he was mildly hampered on his descent by Aristotle clinging to his face in terror, the poor darling.
	Please
send my apologies to Severus for that unfortunate incident in Potions
class. I should have warned him that Wednesday was experimenting
with, shall we say, some variant recipes. I am quite certain,
however, that Miss Parkinson‚Äôs hair will grow back normally, and that
the snakes are only a temporary embellishment.
	My
best regards, and do drop by for tea if you ever happen to be in the
neighborhood. Thing has perfected your favorite shortbread recipe - I
do believe he has a little crush on you. Or perhaps it is merely that
you are the only visitor we have had, outside of family, who is
sensible enough to shake hands with him without flinching.
	Yours
truly,
	Morticia
Addams

4THOR: RAGNAROK Period AU After Lord Odin, founder of Odin &amp; Sons Gold Company, passed away from a mysterious illness, Thor Odinson is forced to come back from his two-year sabbatical to Asgard Hall as rightful heir of the land and the business. This immediately puts him at odds with his adopted brother Loki who, until then, was overseeing the property and operations (to little success) as the acting heir. Friction sparks between both brothers when Thor suspects Loki of his involvement with their father‚Äôs sudden demise‚Äîuntil an unexpected visitor, a woman named Hela, changes the game and claims to be their estranged eldest sister and the rightful heir of Lord Odin.

Keith‚Äôs visceral fear of abandonment when it comes to Shiro makes so much more sense now because he always knew he was going to lose him someday,, this wasn‚Äôt some far off thing‚Äìeven if they survived everything with the galra and Voltron, Keith knew Shiro wasn‚Äôt going to live a long life. He knew and lived in absolute terror of the fact that Shiro was living on borrowed time, that he could be torn away from him any day.¬†It‚Äôs why he‚Äôs so angry and defensive when other people tell him to give up on Shiro, it‚Äôs why he‚Äôs so fired up when Shiro nearly gives up on himself. Shiro telling Keith he‚Äôs finally died in season 6 is the bomb Keith has been waiting for the universe to drop for literally years. He‚Äôs facing his absolute worst fear, and like a miracle, he still manages to find a way to bring Shiro back.¬†And Keith has seen others give up on Shiro the way people have given up on him‚Äìwhenever he promises not to abandon Shiro, not to leave without him, to save him as many times as it takes‚Äìthat‚Äôs so powerful given their tragic pasts. They have both been left behind by loved ones, but they‚Äôve finally found a home with each other. They love one another unconditionally and neither will ever abandon the other. It‚Äôs a link that they both ached for and need.¬†because I see people doing it again, I‚Äôm gonna just once again request: please don‚Äôt tag as bro/ganes,,

On Borrowed TimeJamie/Claire Modern AU: The story of Claire Beauchamp, a feminist studies scholar and J.A.M.M Fraser, a playwright, spanning over a period of ten years between Cambridge, MA and Edinburgh, Scotland.This is my first fic. My deepest gratitude goes to @notevenjokingrightnow for giving me the courage to see this through. She tolerated my incessant questions, paranoia, and self-doubt. For @kalendraashtar, you uplift my spirits with your words of wisdom. To everyone who have DM me with messages of encouragement, thank you for your care. It means a lot to a first-time writer.PrologueCambridge, MassachusettsPresent DayLeaves fluttering in the breeze. Branches, bare. An exercise in self-protection. The banks of the Charles River. Resplendent in shades of red, amber, and brown. Cambridge in autumn. Warm spices, crisp air, damp earth. The scent, a balm for the wounded soul. The memories, a splinter. Another existence. Another lifetime.Royal Botanic Gardens. Bursting with aromatic sweetness. Edinburgh in autumn. Hearts, overlapping. Sheltered.Under a canopy of burnished gold.It is a dream within a dream.I tried to walk away. I stumbled.Over and over again.When I finally did, I succeeded in leaving myself behind.The world crumbles. How does one exist as an empty shell?Memories of him.Of us. Of what we were. Of what was possible. Saturating my bones.Seven years. Survivorship. In a shadowy world. Tumbling in a restless void. Chipping away the fragmented soul. Was it a choice when there was none to be made?It is not that I have been happy or unhappy without him. It is not that I can or cannot live without him.It is because I am no longer capable of believing. The pain so neatly stitched into my soul is inconsequential.Cambridge. A sanctuary.A semblance of a life. A thriving career.Accommodating companion. A seemingly perfect existence.My insides have long been twisted and shredded. The darkness lurks. Threatens to engulf me. Yet again. Faith. No longer present to hold it at bay.Grief. Desire. Longing.If I crawled into myself I might not recognize what resides within.Chapter 1
