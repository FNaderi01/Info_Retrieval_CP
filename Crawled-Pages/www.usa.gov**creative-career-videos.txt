        Hi, I'm Antonio Alonso. I'm the Regional Chief Architect for the GSA (General Services Administration) National Capital Region.My role is to review designs and approve design work what we hire architects who work on our buildings. Again, we do large new construction and renovation projects. And my role here as an architect with the government is to manage the design and lead a team of other architects, engineers also, historic preservationists, interior designers all working on these projects, and reviewing them.Green RoofsBuildings have a great impact on our environment and one-third of all greenhouse gasses come from buildings.One of our favorite things we've been doing is using green roof technology on many of our projects. When it rains, what happens here is this area of green absorbs water and doesn't allow it to run into the gutters and down into the street where it gets mixed up with the sewer system. It also keeps the roof cooler than a traditional roof, so it serves as a form of insulation to the building.Energy Efficient LightingSo what was used here at One Constitution were two types of lighting that were different. One is called a compact fluorescent lamp. It is a fluorescent lamp that is very energy-efficient and lasts a really long time.The other is something called a LED light, a light-emitting diode. These types of lights produce very little heat, they're cool to the touch, they last a very long time, and they're very durable. They're also environmentally conscious because they're made without any type of toxic material such as mercury.How do I become an architect?Architecture is an art and a science. So mathematics is very important. Geometry, for example, is fundamental to understanding and it's a skill that all architects needs to have. So study your Geometry.

        Narrator: In this episode, we visit the General Services Administration (GSA) in Washington DC. GSA has a Fine Arts program for placing artwork, like paintings and sculptures, in government buildings and courthouses across the country. Meet Kim.Kim: I think it’s important for government buildings to have artwork because they reach a different audience than museums do. Some museums are expensive and not everybody can afford to go, but government buildings, people can go into them and anybody can see the artwork there.What’s your favorite part of your job?The favorite part of my job is actually just getting to work with artists. They are able to think in creative ways and able to create works that I could never envision [imagine] in a place and those works I think really just add value to the overall building project and are a real plus for the American public.I worked on a project in Yuma, Arizona for a courthouse there and I worked with an artist named John Bisbee. He created a project called “Lion Dandies.” It’s a freestanding sculpture. It’s made of these kind of spike-like looking large spheres stacked against each other, on top of one another.  It was a really, really lovely experience working there.How does it all work?We have a site visit and that’s really fun. So the artist gets to walk the project site, we introduce them to the architect. We introduce them to members of the project team, so they can learn everything they can about the site. That way that have as much information as possible. They develop a concept that they think is going to make sense for this building and this project site.And if all goes well the (artwork) concept will move forward and the artist will go into fabrication [creating the artwork] and installation [placing the artwork in the government building].Once everything is fabricated [the artwork is created], we try to have the artist install the artwork as close as possible to the end of construction in the building because we don’t want the artwork to be damaged.What advice do you have for kids?I think it’s important to have good project management skills. So just focus on getting one thing done at a time; being able to handle a lot of different types of things; being flexible.You have to be prepared, you know hiccups in the road.  You know no matter how much you plan, it’s important to be a planner too, but no matter how much you plan there’s always going to be a hiccup and so you have to be nimble [quick] and quick and on your feet and ready to handle it at any time.

        My name is Cris Comerford; I'm the White House Executive Chef.Responsibilities as a chefMy main responsibility as the Executive Chef of the White House is taking care of the First Family, foremost and all. Just their daily meals, and of course if they have any social functions or state dinners or any kind of entertaining, we take care of everything in the kitchen.Definitely, it's high pressure because first and foremost, it's for the President of the United States, so and also, of course, the visiting countries and the visiting Heads of State because you want to respect their traditions, you want to respect their protocol dietary restrictions. So there is a lot of things to learn.The White House GardenWe have harvested so much in that little garden, and in a span of 2½ years, there are 300 at least pounds of produce that we have harvested throughout the years.These are actual Italian eggplant that came from the garden. Eggplant is such a wonderful staple. And then, what I did earlier is just grilled this until it is charred; and what it does is, it's easy to peel, but then at the same time it gives it a wonderful flavor.Did you always want to be a chef?I didn't know that I wanted to be a chef growing up. It's definitely not on my top list. I wanted to be a scientist. I went to the University of the Philippines, I took up food technology. But I think the more I worked with food and I always helped my mom cook for a family of 11, it's a huge family, so every day it's like a banquet in our house. But not thinking that's what I'm really gearing up for.So when I was going to college, my dad actually asked me "Why don't you go to Le Cordon Bleu?"Why should kids learn to cook?If you really make food yourself, you could control the taste, you could control the fat that's in there, you could control the salt, you could control the sugar. And at the end of the day, it's very rewarding because it's your own hand that made it.Be hands on, work really hard, and then really listen to your parents because they really know you more than you think. So in my experience, like what my dad was saying; at the time I just laughed at him. But actually he was very, very right, so listen to your parents and help out your mom and dad cooking in the kitchen.
