United States Coast Guard Auxiliary[edit]
The United States Coast Guard Auxiliary is the uniformed auxiliary service of the Coast Guard.  The unit does not use the Coast Guard rank system, but uses modified Coast Guard officer rank insignia to signify a member's position within the organization.  For example, a Flotilla Commander wears insignia similar to a Lieutenant.
  USCG Auxiliary Insignia
USCG Auxiliary officers wear silver braid insignia (referred to as "office insignia") instead of gold; with a "hollow" USCG shield above containing the letters "USCG" superimposed above a red "A" (to signify an appointed officer") or silver "A" (to signify an elected officer).  Metal and sew-on insignia are identical to Coast Guard officer insignia, except that a red, blue, or black "A" is superimposed.
Auxiliarists generally do not use titles in direct address, with the exception of a few very senior leaders who are addressed as "Commodore."
