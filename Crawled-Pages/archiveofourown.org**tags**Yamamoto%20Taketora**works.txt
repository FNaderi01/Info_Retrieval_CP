    Summary
      Kuroo Tetsurou has made many minor mistakes over the course of his life. Impulsive annexation of amicable neighboring territories isn't usually one of them. Still, bad (mostly imaginary) breakups can do that to you. Especially when your (not quite) ex-lover is capable of the same, if not worse.  (i.e.: kuroo and daishou have a teensy international conflict level spat)

    Summary
      “Do you have 11 protons? Because you’re sodium fine!” -- Kuroo is the most oblivious person that anyone in the Nekoma Volleyball Club have ever met. And his horrible chemistry pickup lines do not, in any way, make up for it.Poor Kenma.

      Japan, year 2020.
A popular myth says that humans with wolf heritage, commonly called lycanthropes, hunt humans to devour them.
Hunters have taken part of the country's territories, sowing fear and killing entire packs until they are reduced to ashes. War has been openly declared and it may be time to stop it. But… will the few remaining packs be able to stop their advance?

    Summary
      Catalyst-an agent that provokes or speeds significant change or actionKenma Kozume wasn't a particularly remarkable person, he disliked people and wasn't confrontational. He preferred to stick to the shadows and let others take the spotlight and was perfectly content with his life.Until he became a tribute for the hunger games.Everything was quickly growing out of hand as he made friends and enemies and reunites with someone from his past.And to top it all off, Kenma was becoming the catalyst for revolution.(AKA, Kenma accidentally sparks a revolution in the hunger games with the help of Kuroo, Bokuto, Akaashi, Oikawa, Iwaizumi, Daichi, Suga, Ushijima and Tendou)

    Summary
      Yaku knew that for all the thinking and strategy that went into the way the Nekoma team worked it was surprising for outsiders to figure out that his team shared a single brain cell outside of matches and most of the time they forgot the brain cell was even there so it wasn't used at allBut today? Today those motherfuckers were testing his patience.

    Summary
      Daichi and Suga do not tolerate physical altercations between their teammates, and they especially do not tolerate lying. In the end Tanaka, Hinata, and Kageyama should have known better; but they will not be making the same mistake again. (Basically Daichi and Suga are the parents of their team, but their kids are not making it easy on them)

    Summary
      A book in which I plan on writing one shots for Haikyuu, using various prompts from Bad Things Happen bingo sheets, because I'm a slut for angst. The prompts I'm using will be in the first chapter, where I will be taking requests! Please comment some so I'll be able to,,, you know,,, write! All ships are welcome here unless they're p*dophilia or inc*est *looks directly at anyone who ships Atsumu and Osamu* I'm also open to things centered around one particular character.Anyways- leave some requests?

    Summary
      It doesn’t matter if you like volleyball or not, hell you haven’t even seen a game at all, but the fact that you heard that if you manage a really good team it could look really good on a resume for a college and as a deaf girl you need everything you could get. How will the Nekoma volleyball team cope with a new manager who's deaf?
