    Summary
      First year at Hogwarts is a time for self discovery, making friends, and possibly starting yourself on a horrible downward spiral where your exceptional abilities alienate yourself from everyone around you. Harry Potter, for reasons he's personally curious about, cannot seem to die or even be hurt. Draco Malfoy has been dealt the cruel hand by fate to have so little magical power as to be barely better than a squib. Hermione Granger is a deaf natural legilimens. And Ron Weasley has been inducted into the ultra-selective society known as the Sparrowkeet Lounge. One stop down the line is still a long way from canon.

    Summary
      Second year is a time for self reflection, making enemies, and probably beginning a horrifying killing spree under directions from a magic journal you thought was your friend. Join Ginny Weasley, a narcoleptic insomniac obsessed with televison, Luna Lovegood, a victim of the same experimental magic that caused her mother her death, and the rest of the gang from year one. Not Quirrel though: he's dead.
