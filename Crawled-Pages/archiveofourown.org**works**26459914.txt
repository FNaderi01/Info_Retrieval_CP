    Summary
      There’s no joy, no relief in his Father’s gaze at seeing him alive, nothing more than the barest flash of interest before his gaze slides away towards the limp figure hanging in Mother’s arms.Instead of the bitter thang of jealousy, fear clogs up Ben’s throat. The movement under his shirt visible for all to see as they tense, restless at the threat to—To what, exactly?The Horror falls silent.“Very well then, Number Six.” Dad turns away. “You may follow along.”In the following time of his resurrection that Klaus sleeps away, Ben gets the chance to give two of his siblings the closure they need.
