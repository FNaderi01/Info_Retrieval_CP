    Summary
      After fleeing from hunters Derek found refuge in a small Wyoming town. For almost ten years, he lived alone in a cabin among acres of land, until one night he stumbles upon a car accident near his place. When the driver comes to with his friendly smile and beautiful brown eyes, there’s no way Derek could’ve predicted the next three weeks.
Stiles is a hunter who can’t go home and the alpha of the fallen Hale pack is his Hail Mary. What he didn’t expect to find was a gentle and broken man in place of the so-called mighty alpha. Despite the pressures from back home, Stiles keeps putting off what he has to do, while falling for the one person he’s not supposed to.

    Summary
      I don't know how to summarize this fic, so here are the things you need to know:  Derek wears boots, rides a horse named Wolf, and everyone has a low, slow West Texas drawl.  Isaac plays the piano and Boyd says "ain't."  Stiles is a little shit.  So that part hasn't changed.**The Old West AU you didn't know you needed.

    Summary
      Derek knows that Stiles is too young for him, but Stiles doesn't agree. Eight years after Derek rejects him due to the age gap, they meet again where Derek has settled in Wyoming as a ranch hand, and Stiles is the new deputy, and still pissed as hell about the way Derek turned him down. Things don't go as either of them planned. (I'm sure a million fics have been written about older Stiles and Derek, but this one has cowboy Derek, does that help?)

    Summary
      “Yes,” Derek said. Vague, but it seemed to shut her up. Her eyes were wide and her cupid bow lips were slightly parted.
“He’s only a couple years older than you,” Melissa waggled her brow at Stiles. Stiles continued to stare at Derek. He shifted uncomfortably and took the whiskey bottle in his hand and poured another shot.
He’s not doing this sober. Leroy knew the way to the old barn.
