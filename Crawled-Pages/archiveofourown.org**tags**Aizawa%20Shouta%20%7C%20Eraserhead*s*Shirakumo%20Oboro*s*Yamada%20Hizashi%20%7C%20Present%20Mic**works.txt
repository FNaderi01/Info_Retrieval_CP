      "Only the phoenix rises and does not descend. And everything changes. And nothing is truly lost. " -Neil Gaiman
Oboro survives, which means he's there to save Shimura Tenko from a terrible fate. Touya and Keigo help each other survive their training relatively intact.
And just like that, everything changes.

    Summary
      He didn’t know who or what he was expecting to walk out of that elevator, but the seventeen or eighteen year old boy that walked out of it carefully cradling a duffel bag in his arms was not it. He didn’t get a good look at him, the room was dark and he wasn’t near the light of the windows but he could see some of him, mostly he could see the glowing yellow eyes peering around the room though the dark.He put on the most dazzling smile he could. “Hello there. I’m All Might, I’m a Pro Hero, do you need help?”The boy made eye contact with him and looked at him in shock. Almost like he couldn’t believe he was real.“You came…” He spoke in a soft, pained voice almost as if it was hard to speak. “I thought… I thought you might not.”orOboro found a loophole is his mission and used it to get Tenko the fuck out of dodge, knowing full well that it would surely lead to his death. But both he and All For One underestimated one thing, just how far three dumbass new pro heroes and a 6 year old are willing to go to get him back.

    Summary
  reading the previous fic is not required to understand this one!
kintsugi: the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery by mending the areas of breakage with lacquer dusted or mixed with powdered gold, silver, or platinum. as a philosophy, it treats breakage and repair as part of the history of an object, rather than something to disguise. it connotes beauty in broken things.--dabidevito said 'what if a bunch of the 1a kids became teachers at ua?' and i said 'okay yes and what if shiggy got his redemption arc, what if shirakumo came back from being kurogiri, what if eri was a student at ua, and what if we got todobakudeku and shinkami and erasercloudmic on top of all that?' and thus this fic was born

    Summary
      The noise brings back the ants, and the bees have built a hive in his heart, so Yamada walks in twos in a direction he cannot name. There wasn't a body to burn, and he doesn't know what that means, but the one in his arms is hot like scorched earth....and not for the first time, Yamada must rally himself to have the patience and love of 3 people.

    Summary
   He knew that one day his bad luck would catch up to him, and his parents or the knights wouldn’t be around to help. It might even end up causing Suki to get hurt. He didn’t want that.
  “Wouldn’t it be easier to fight together though?” Suki asked and added to the drawing so that both stick figures had swords, armor, and horses. “I mean, don’t all the great heroes have someone fighting alongside them. They’re never alone. Like my daddies and the Emperor, and all kinds of other famous knights. They fight together, and they always win and save everybody. Especially people they really like.” Kazunori watched the bright grin that shone on Suki’s face. Very cautiously, he took Suki’s hand. Suki looked at first confused by the sudden gesture but squeezed his hand. “Let’s promise to stay by each other’s side so we never have to fight alone, okay?” 
Growing up inside the palace, Prince Kazunori was safe. The child of the greatest heroes in the land, it was his job to succeed them. But in a world full of people that would rather see him dead, can he survive even if he must hide all connections he has to the imperial family? Will he ever be able to reclaim the life he was denied?

    Summary
      When dealing with one of the school's newest urban legends, an accident occurs that sends Hanako into a different world from his, caused by the entity he originally made a deal with. There he is supposed to attain his much wanted redemption. But is he really cut out to be a hero?Stendhal and Dabi had two things in common; they both looked homeless in their own appartment and they both picked up annoying strays.Kurogiri is famous. Shinsou likes cats. Aizawa likes sleep. All For One is too nosy. Tomura just wants to reach the Main Quest, but a new gaming buddy will do for the meantime.Izuku keeps running into the same strange boy, but surely that doesn't mean anything, right?

    Summary
      Izuku Midoriya learned that not all man were created equal when he was 6 years old, he learned not to judge others by their titles when he was 8 years old and he was 9 when he died along with his parents, and Gem was born.Gem intended to survive, he would not be weak like Izuku had been and he had 6 rules to make sure that he survived;1.never show any weaknesses2.don't trust others easily3.be brave infront of danger4. no one can know that you are quirkless5.be good6.forget the existance of Izuku Midoriya Well he had managed to mess it up pretty good up til now and he had no idea how the hell he was even alive considering that he had broken very single rule that he had made... (I have rewritten chapter 2 and 3 and merged chapter 2 and 3 together along with chapter 4 and 5 together)

    Summary
      This is going to be very slow to update on top of being a selfless self insert with lots of dark themes. It will have things such as non-consensual incest and child pregnancy. It will also feature demons, occult things, and soulmates (I'm a sucker for soulmates).  This is my first work on AO3, so please be patient with me if you actually want to read it. I'll be editing this later for a proper summary. Don't like, don't read
