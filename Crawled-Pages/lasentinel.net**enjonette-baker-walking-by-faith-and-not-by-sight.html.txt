Enjonette Baker, Walking by Faith and Not By Sight              
				By Kimberlee Buck, Staff Writer                
	                	                Published March 22, 2017

Becoming successful was never an option for Compton native and business owner Enjonette Baker. Today, she is reminding Black women of all ages that a woman’s success does not need to come from the strength of a man.
Baker grew up in a two parent house hold and attended both private and public schools throughout her childhood. After high school, she went on to attend Cal State Dominguez Hills where she received a Bachelor’s of Arts degree in Communication and Marketing.
Prior to becoming a business owner, Baker was working in various fields.

“I have probably had any job you can think of,” said Baker. “I have worked in retail, I have worked in restaurants, and I have worked in an oil refinery. It was just to the point where I was working and I said I need to be working for myself. My mind frame has always been—work for yourself.”
In 2012, Baker started her own event company called No Mask Events. Since the launch of her business, Baker has planned weddings, anniversaries, birthday parties and more. This year, Baker is focusing on restructuring her business. At No Masks Events, Baker works with Kim, a longtime family friend.

“The thing that I love about working with Kim is not only do I have that wisdom there, I can come to her and tell her ‘Kim, this is my vision’ and she can bring it to life and make it work so perfectly,” said Baker.
Aside from working with Kim, Baker also receives event support from her family and friends.
In the next five-to-ten years, Baker plans on bringing someone on to help her tackle the business side of the event planning company.
One year after Baker started the event planning company, God placed it on her heart to start Women Blessing Women.
“I would always go out to networking events and it seemed like there was always competition with women,” said Baker. “I would run across other event planners that were women and it was kind of like, ‘I’m not going to tell you anything or my connections.’ The way I have always looked at business is that I can never take away your business. Yours is what’s for you. One day I was just praying and I was like, ‘Lord, what can I do?’ It was just to the point where I didn’t want to do networking anymore.”

Baker expressed that it was in her spirit to start a women’s organization.
“I wanted to bring like-minded women who have either started their own business or are in the process of starting their own business together where we can connect,” said Baker. “If you are an event planner or a DJ, we can work together. If I am an event planner and you are a caterer, we can work together.”
The first meeting started with three-to-four women, overtime the number of members grew. Today, the women’s organization has 30 members. Baker has been able to use her organization to provide a place for women to bless one another. As a result, one of her members has been able to get her book in the hands of Steve Harvey among many other opportunities.
“My organization is not huge, its’ not on the map where people know, but locally, knowing I was able to bless these women in some way, just from connecting them with other like-minded women has been amazing,” said Baker.
Currently Baker is focusing on redefining the purpose of the organization by making sure women are getting what they should be getting out of the organization and ultimately making sure Women Blessing Women is being utilized the way God has planned.
Later, Baker met her future business partner Mieka. The two met through a mutual friend which resulted in the two ladies working together to put on a prom dress giveaway. After seeing how well the pair worked together, they decided to start their own business called, Around the Way CEO’s.
“We are promoting as business owners, that you can be who you are without having on business attire. I come dressed in jeans, tennis shoes and a t-shirt majority of the time. You can still run your business and be a business owner,” said Baker.
After starting the brand and company, Baker and Mieka decided to write an e-book which explains to business owners how to build a brand from the ground up.
The e-book titled, “Self-Made CEO in 30 Days” is a step-by-step guide that provides new and future business owners with information on where to go, numbers to call, websites to visit, and all that’s left is the footwork. The book can be purchased for $20 at http://www.aroundthewayceos.com/ .
From there, the duo branched out and started a radio show called, “Around the Way CEO’s Radio” through Accelerated Radio and completed a ten part series which provided individuals with the opportunity to promote their businesses, share information with other listeners and discuss the struggles and failures that lead them to the success they have today.
Aside from running her three businesses, Baker is also on the executive planning team for Compton Mayor Aja Brown’s young girls mentor program, Becoming Ladies of Opulence and Magnitude (BLOOM).

Baker has also joined forces with Ms. Towns to start a new podcast called, “Hustle Rehab Radio” which airs every Thursday at 6pm PST on Accelerated Radio.
“The show is for anyone who is addicted to some type of hustle, we want to hear your story, whether its music, movies or a business, we want to know your story,” said Baker.
Baker’s next career moves include focusing on becoming an expert in radio and eventually becoming a part of a bigger brand. She also in the process of branding herself under EnjoB. and holding on to her businesses.
Looking back on her life and all she has accomplished, Baker gives all the glory to God.
“To be honest, I don’t know what people believe in but it is by the grace of God. Sometimes I don’t go to sleep until 2 am. but I have to continue to invest in myself and work to get to the place that I want to be,” said Baker. “It’s a lot but I can’t stop and I won’t stop.”
Baker encourages young Black women who are interested in starting their own business to try it.
“Some people are scared to make that next step but if you never take it, you will never know. So just really take that faith walk,” said Baker.“If it doesn’t work, that’s okay, you can try something else. If it’s something about it that you don’t like, that’s okay you can find somebody else to carry that part for you. You don’t need the best camera, you don’t need a thousand dollars, you don’t need the best team around you. Just start, you have to start somewhere.”
