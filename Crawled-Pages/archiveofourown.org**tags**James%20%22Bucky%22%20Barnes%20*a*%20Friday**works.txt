    Summary
      Finding out about his parents' murder at the hand of the Winter Soldier, Captain America's old war buddy, pushes Tony Stark into a very dark place and he turns to the former HYDRA assassin with a burning fury, part of him screaming for revenge.Finding out that Steve knew and didn't tell him pushes him over the edge and he lashes out against the super soldier, but just as Steve is about to retaliate the Winter Soldier takes Tony by surprise, by knocking Steve out and surrendering.The Winter Soldier knows that to be free HYDRA must be crushed, and for that to happen his best chance is the resources of Tony Stark, when Captain America shows up in Bucharest the fragmented memories of who he once was tells him that the Captain will protect him and bring him to the Avengers so the Asset goes with him, but when the Captain is about to attack Iron Man with deadly intent he makes a choice and goes against the voices within.The Asset neutralizes the Captain and surrenders to Iron Man, hoping that he will be able to convince the man to use HYDRA's own weapon to take them down.

    Summary
      James "Bucky" Barnes died in 1971 after twenty-six years of torture under HYDRA. The Winter Soldier is not Bucky Barnes, he doesn't even like Bucky Barnes. Steve Rogers doesn't understand this, and the idea that Steve wants to warp him into someone he doesn't really care for annoys the Soldier. He will kill him for the offenses against him, those against Natalia, and those against Tony Stark, because none of them deserve that. The story where the Winter Soldier is a bad influence, and Tony loves bad influences. Natalia and Rhodey are along for the ride, and for their idiot friends that are actually too brilliant for their own good.Note: There is some major character bashing, maybe. I'm not good at telling sometimes, but I really do not like certain characters and you will definitely know which ones they are. Hiatus (but not gone for good!)

    Summary
      Tony Stark has been kidnapped and James is willing to do anything to get him back; letting his experience as the Winter Soldier guide him through a HYDRA safehold was the only logical choice—Tony Stark needed to be saved and, call it selfish, James wanted to be the one to do it. [Post Civil-War, but there's not actually much talk of it.]

    Summary
      Peter doesn't go to the tower every day, because that would be silly. He doesn't need to see Tony that often, and anyway he doesn't want to bother Tony. Besides, he's busy with his small circle of friends and being Spider-Man, so it's fine. Tony's always happy to see him when he does stop by, and when Peter has good news to share his superhero mentor is willing to buy him pizza to celebrate.Spider-Man knew that Tony had a house guest, but when Peter drops by the tower to share something awesome, he's surprised to find himself face to face with the Winter Soldier.

    Summary
      FRIDAY was made by Tony Stark to be helpful and to assist JARVIS. With her predecessor gone, she's floundering to fill a role she was never meant to have. Her creator only calls on her when he's forced to, limiting her usefulness and engaging with her, for the most part, only when he uses the Iron Man suit. She's learned to accept that, even if she doesn't like it. The arrival of Captain Rogers and his team has the potential to change that, if she's willing to let go of the expectations of Tony Stark.

    Summary
      James hasn't been able to choose his own haircut in decades; Steve has been after him to ditch the shag and cut it short again, while Tony seems mostly indifferent. Until the actual haircut happens, of course - then Peter and Kamala are happy to help him compliment James' latest choice. Teasing and shenanigans ensue, leaving the ex-Hydra assassin feeling pretty content about his new home and the people in it.
And if his haircut is hiding a little secret, well. That's entirely his business.

    Summary
      Steve couldn't be happier - Bucky's back, he's on the Avengers again, and everything can finally go back to normal. Though he wishes the Avengers - mostly Tony - would stop making him jump through hoops just so he can be team leader again. And who invited these kids onto the team anyway? The Accords are still too limiting, but he can work with them for now. He knows it's only a matter of time before the rest of the world sees it the way he does. Bucky seems to be having a bit of an identity crisis, but Steve doesn't mind; he's with Buck 'til the end of the line, so he can weather this minor storm. And sure, Tony won't let him into the workshop or even really talk to him anymore, but that can't last forever either - soon he'll be able to admit that Steve was right, and things will be like they were before.
... but is it too much to ask that it happens soon?
