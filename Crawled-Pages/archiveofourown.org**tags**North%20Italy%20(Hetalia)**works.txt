    Summary
      So, this story was inspired but the many songs done by the voice actors, and I thought I'd be cool to have them all in a band. Then I was thinking about axis and allies and it was just too perfect. The first chapter will be context of the AU then the chapters after will be about the characters. And fair warning, every single couple will have a smut scene, so keep an eye out.

      Ludwig had been worked among the seas for years, fascinated by the idea of traveling only to find monotonous work. But, with every trip, he would remark each whale he would see upon his journies, especially one named Sorrow, who lingered near what was known as the weeping rock. He had only seen the tail of this mysterious whale, not expecting to find a beautiful guardian of the sea behind it.

    Summary
      以美國為背景，但就嚴格來說是半架空或微妙的平行世界看標題就知道是描寫日常生活與工作想到什麼就寫什麼OOC主角大概是伊雙子，有些角色很想讓他們活躍但很可惜就是沒有辦法請不要太認真看待內容～☆
