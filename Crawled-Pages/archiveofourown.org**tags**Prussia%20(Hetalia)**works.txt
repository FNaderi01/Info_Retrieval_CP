    Summary
      After losing WW2, Prussia is forcefully separated from his brother to live with Russia. To make things worse, he is under the same roof as Lithuania which normally wouldn’t be a problem for anyone else, but for Prussia things are a bit awkward as during his time as Duchy he broke Lithuania's heart and betrayed him. As the two are forced to confront their past, their relationship becomes even harder to explain and untold truths could lead to a happy ending or even more misery.

    Summary
      So, this story was inspired but the many songs done by the voice actors, and I thought I'd be cool to have them all in a band. Then I was thinking about axis and allies and it was just too perfect. The first chapter will be context of the AU then the chapters after will be about the characters. And fair warning, every single couple will have a smut scene, so keep an eye out.
