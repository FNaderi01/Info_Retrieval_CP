    Summary
      Since my rewrite of Trigger Happy Havoc was received overall positively I thought it would be nice to rewrite the second game too. Like Dawn of Despair there will be changes to some degree including murder methods, killers, executions and survivors.The changes may be slightly less dramatic here since I found the plot of the second game a little less rage inducing than the first, so I will mostly focus on giving the characters more depth. I especially want to give the girls more development since Kodaka is terrible at writing female characters and I hate how they were mostly used as fanservice fodder. Similarly, I will be cutting out the creepier aspects in the canon game (you know what I mean), also Teru is cancelled. Again there will be more LGBTQ representation because heteronormativity blows.Anyway I hope you enjoy this rewrite and have a blast!

    Summary
      I made another groupchat fic after the failed attept at my MHA one,, lets see how this goes.do not expect frequent updates. i cant even update my other works (then again both of those are MHA and i barely like that anymore so)also,, a l  o t of rarepairs. just read the tags.also, the ishimondomikan and shinsaimami are both eventual, so if your here for that, just give it a few chapters because im also impatient lol.some ships are subject to change!  (not a lot tho, ive only changed one so far and am most likely not changing any others)

    Summary
      First of all, you gotta admit, my titling skills are A+ worthy. Second of all, this will contain spoilers for the entire series, mainly V3 because they're my main cast here. This will include ships and some head canons I personally have, but hopefully they don't dictate the story too much, but I hope you respect my choices here.  Anyways, as for the story itself, this takes place in a VR/Hope's Peak Academy AU where everyone is alive. However, not everyone is awake at the beginning of the fic, so some people will be absent until after a few chapters chapters. Since this is beyond what I'm used to as far as writing goes, I will be adding written scenes, as well as a plot (w o w .) All the characters, including those from THH and GD are in their first year and similar ages, that way we can have the same cast for all three years. Also, if you see parallels between the canon series, it is probably intentional. Kiibo is also human, but that will be mentioned in the story in case you didn't read the description. Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy!

    Summary
      Making out with Tanaka Gundam is one thing, getting him to go beyond that is a challenge that Hinata's never had to face in his life. He's not that good at figuring it out, certainly not when his boyfriend can be as damned obtuse as Hinata himself.

    Summary
      It's said that those who attend Hope's Peak Academy are guaranteed for a life of success. However, that can’t be said for all the students attending. For the ones who are admitted in the Reserve Course are given false hope. Being forced to pay a large sum of money thinking that by the time they graduate they’ll be fulfilled in life.
Even so, one of these students have been given a chance, a once in a lifetime chance to be able to attend Hope's Peaks Academy Main Course. In fifty days, Hajime Hinata will go through the Izuru Kamakura Project, until then, he’ll continue his life as a regular Reserve Course student. Being a loner throughout his entire first year in High School, he believes that a measly fifty days should be easy enough to handle. 
Or so he thought.

      Gundham didn't know what to make of the plain, ordinary-looking mortal who was always trying to spend time with him. And he sure as hell didn't know how to properly address his feelings for said mortal. A songfic to 'Two Birds on a Wire' by Regina Spektor.

    Summary
      Hajime and the other survivors have awakened from the Neo World Program, but things aren't over. Everyone's dealing with the traumas of what they went through and what they did under the influence of despair while trying to wake up their remaining comatose classmates, and Hajime, while dealing with sharing with his alter-ego Izuru, is constantly hounded by flashbacks and memories of the time spent in the program with his friends, especially a certain animal breeder, while trying to wake them all up.

    Summary
      Hajime gets a boyfriend, almost joins the yakuza, gets banned from all Walmarts in a 50 mile radius, accidentally comes out to his entire family via mass-text, gets high in a skate park, and sees several men's genitalia on Omegle, all within a span of about six hours. For the record, none of this is chronological - or legal, probably. This is what his parents get for leaving him unsupervised for a weekend...(alternate summary: hajime and the boyz fuckin around like teenagers do)(i have affectionately nicknamed this group "the boyz" with a sunglasses emoji after it and YES the emoji is mandatory.)
