						The LA Unified school board today approved the renewal petitions of three independent public charter schools and approved a petition for one new charter school.
The new charter school approved by the board is Gabriella Charter School 2, which plans to serve up to 468 students in grades TK-6 in Boyle Heights or Lincoln Heights. The first Gabriella Charter School opened in 2005 in Echo Park.
The three charters that received approval of their renewal petitions are APEX Academy, which serves up to 450 students in grades 7-12 at the Helen Bernstein Complex campus, Math and Science College Preparatory, which serves up to 532 students in grades 9-12 at 3200 W. Adams Blvd. in Los Angeles and Para Los Niños Charter, which serves up to 410 students in grades K-5 at 1617 E. 7th St in Los Angeles.
The board also approved a material revision of the charter for Crown Preparatory Academy to add a STEM focus.
The vote for approvals were all unanimous and made on the consent agenda for the special meeting dedicated solely to charter schools that have received recommendations of approval from district staff. At another special session planned for 5 p.m. today, the board will consider charter petitions from those that have received a recommendation of denial.
A record number of charter schools have been recommended for denial at that meeting.
