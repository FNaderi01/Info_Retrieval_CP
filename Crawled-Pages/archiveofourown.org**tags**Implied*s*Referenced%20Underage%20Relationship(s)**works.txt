    Summary
      Taehyung is a 27 years old single father of his adopted daughter, who makes ends meet by his writing job.One day, his daughter, Elina, brought a stranger-homeless-teenager boy home. Unacceptable of course, because he is very protective of his baby girl but somehow that boy ended up staying with them (and became Elina's crush). Taehyung couldn't get rid of the feeling that there's something to this boy, Jeon Jungkook than what meets the eye, something that's hidden very well underneath his surface. Can he figure it out in time? Or his curiosity will get him devoured?

    Summary
      After Time Compression the world was saved, but only from Ultimecia.  The more mundane problems of a world where the state of Galbadia has been effectively decapitated twice in a month, Esthar was experiencing a Lunar Cry, Trabia lost its guardian to a missle strike have come to the fore.  There are precious few resources to solve these kinds of problems, and when it rains it pours.  (more tags as writing continues, I'm not 100% sure what's going to happen so it'll be a surprise to everyone, Read Tags After Updates!)

    Summary
      It was supposed to be his time. Once a child turned thirteen, they were watched. By sixteen? Their position was decided and their fate sealed. It could happen at any time at that point. Anytime they could be taken; imprisoned before shelled off to their likely duty chosen for them. For Peter, it didn’t happen immediately.OrPeter is forced to Marry Tony and bear his children; falsely believing they were randomly paired. He is to forget himself, his personality, and dull himself down to conform to Tony's preference and standards. He can no longer be Spider-Man, and everything he wanted as a child proves to not be at all what he hoped. Truths are exposed, Peter's identity revealed and Tony's intentions uncovered. Will Peter find forgiveness in himself? Or will he find himself stuck in a place he doesn't want to be, married to a man he can no longer trust?
