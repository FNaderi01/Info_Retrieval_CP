I‚Äôm not going to lie, I think this may be one of my favourite Bow moments of the entire season. Even though many see him as a soft, comedic relief character, he really is the emotional support of his friends. He shows this when him and Glimmer are talking about their kidnapping, and he shows it here.¬†He knows Adora is trying her best. He know that she hurts because everyone is counting on her, and she feels like she failed. That‚Äôs why she apologized to him after he asked if they can still¬†‚Äòfix it‚Äô. They both know they won‚Äôt be able to win, and Adora feels like it‚Äôs her fault. Knowing all of this, Bow realizes that Adora needs comfort, and gives it to her.Basically, what I‚Äôm trying to say, is that Bow is probably the best friend in this entire series and I could never understand how someone could hate him.

yes it‚Äôs artagan but can we talk about how jester was literally so wonderful that she MADE HIM A GODshe was so good HE BECAME A GOD. she was SO GOOD HE WANTED TO BE A GOD FOR OTHER PEOPLEjester is the traveler because she made him the traveler. she made him want to be better, she made this ancient trickster want to be something good. and he‚Äôs terrified of letting her down.how rare is it that a god tries to impress their follower? how rare and how special is it that a god and his first follower make each other what they are?artagan put travelercon so far out, afraid and hoping, and deep in his anxiety he watched jester use his gifts‚Äì not just those of a cleric, but those he‚Äôd given her specifically‚Äì to change the fabric of an incredibly powerful‚Äôs witch‚Äôs mind. she sacrificed a huge part of her innocence to help her friends, and he‚Äôs her friend, right? she‚Äôs always said that. she can do it, he thinks‚Äì she can really help him. she can make him the god he never imagined being.every other god in the damn universe would kill to have jester fancypants lavorre as their cleric. as their patron saint. and she chose to focus all her love and faith and devotion and happiness on him. the last time there was a group who really seemed like they could save exandria, he watched. annoyed them. used them. this time, he‚Äôll do better. for jester. for her friends. because she believes he can.
