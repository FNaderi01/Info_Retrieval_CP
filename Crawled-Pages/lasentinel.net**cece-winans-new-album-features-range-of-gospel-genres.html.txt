CeCe Winans’ New Album Features Range of Gospel Genres

Priscilla “CeCe” Winans touches hearts once again with her new album, “Let Them Fall In Love.” The collection features a range of gospel songs from the reassuring testimony of “He’s Never Failed Me Yet” to the catchy beats of “Lowly.”
The album also debuts her collaboration with her son, Alvin Love III, who wrote and co-produced several songs on the record with Tommy Sims. In fact, according to Winans, the “generation-building” project was Alvin’s idea.
“Alvin shared with me a vision that he had of a record that was bold and a little different than anything I’d ever done before. When I heard the songs he’d been writing, I got so excited,” recalled Winans. “It made it extra special that two generations of family were able to come together on this record.”
Also, the songs include Bishop Hezekiah Walker’s Love Fellowship Choir singing on “Dancing in the Spirit” and The Clark Sisters harmonizing on “Hey Devil.”
While “Let Them Fall In Love” is Winans’ first album in nearly a decade, she has not been idle during her absence from the studio. A little over five years ago, she and her husband, the Rev. Alvin Love, co-founded New Life Church in Nashville where they serve as co-pastors.
In addition to sharing the Gospel, the position allows Winans to mentor young people in general as well as those aspiring to be a recording artist.
“We’re trying to make disciples, so we just want to reach as many people as we can with the Good News. It’s also really important to me to share where I’ve been and to encourage young people to understand that they can go even further,” she said.
Winans has certainly travelled far in her career, amassing 10 Grammy Awards, 20 Dove Awards and seven Stellar Awards along the way. Her other honors include multiple Essence, Soul Train and NAACP Image Awards as well as induction into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the Nashville Music City Walk of Fame.
Despite her track record, Winans still hopes that audiences will respond to her latest work of contemporary gospel music.
“With this album, I pray that it touches the hearts of those who have followed me a long time. But, I also pray that I’ll gain new hearts, I’ll get new listeners because I have a message that the world needs to hear,” said Winans.
