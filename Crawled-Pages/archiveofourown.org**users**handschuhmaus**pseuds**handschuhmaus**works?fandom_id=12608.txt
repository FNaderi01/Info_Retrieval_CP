And Breha...and most other Alderaanians Luke I Am Your Father posthumous online presence casting oversights Alternate Universe - Crack This is not the ending you were looking for Juliet hallucinating due to an experimental virtual reality device extremely irreverent aro-ace Luke Skywalker oblivious ace speculation on just what went on in certain scenes ghosts inconveniently revealing themselves in the middle of theatrical combat Shakespeare in Shyriwook... just how is that going to work? Han Did Not Do The Research Threepio the accidental thespian There is a chicken in our rehearsal audience Obi-Wan panicking Imperial defectors accidentally heroic Hutt political casting decisions explain why Verona has gone to a Hutt It's a trap! (It really isn't) Qui-Gon playing along and thus acting like Mrs. Peel Long Lost/Secret Relatives Even for theater Luke finds this familial relationship improbable mistaking Sean Connery for Christopher Lee (in fairness while hallucinating)
    Summary
      For reasons of morale, the Rebels have decided to try their hands at theater. Han, unfamiliar with the actual content of the play, suggests Romeo and Juliet in hopes of a romantic scene with Leia...and no one else suggested anything. (okay, so Threepio did mention an opera, but that was vetoed for reason of the casting pool being insufficiently musical.) Alas, he gets cast as Paris to her Juliet rather than Romeo.On the day of their first full run-through, it comes to light than ridiculous oversight has led to uncast characters  and a dead man being cast as Capulet and sent messages about it! Add to this two Jedi ghosts who only Luke and Leia can see, the stars' lack of romantic chemistry on stage, two droids and a Wookiee and half of Rogue Squadron among the cast, an injectable virtual reality device, a chicken, a Hutt who's never acted before, and one imperial spy with a direct line to Luke's real father and you've got a sure recipe for chaos and an improvised ending no one expected.
