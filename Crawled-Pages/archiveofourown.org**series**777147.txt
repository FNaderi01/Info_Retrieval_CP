Meet your other half, Rajani.Usually you just go about your way not wanting to be bothered but not today. No, today you are going to talk to a celebrity robot about and impending attack on the monster ambassador Frisk which you are more than willing to help stop, all because a skeleton that’s going to be there decided to save you’re a month back.
