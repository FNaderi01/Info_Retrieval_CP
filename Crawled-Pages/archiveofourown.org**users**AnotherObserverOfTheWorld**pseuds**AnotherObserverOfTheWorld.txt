    Summary
      When Jaskier was four, he slipped his mother’s watch and went to the field to gather a bouquet of dandelions. He climbed back into the yard, as stealthy as a child really cared to be, and crept over to the barn. In the barn, lived a secret. (The man he thought his father said the secret was a monster, a plague. His mother said the secret was his sister.)ORJaskier comes from a far humbler background, and would really like to know why Yennefer never came back for her youngest brother.

    Summary
      They've barely left the tavern in Posada before Geralt has made up his mind about Jaskier. He's annoying and persistent, has zero sense of self-preservation, talks too much and is, first and foremost, painfully, vulnerably human.
The next few weeks prove almost all of those things to be true—all but one.

    Summary
      Soulbonds aren't supposed to be one-sided, but everyone knows witchers don't have soulbonds and Jaskier has learned to live with it, learned to be satisfied with being just Geralt's friend. But then the dragon hunt happens and they split up and the longer Jaskier is away from Geralt, the worse he starts to feel until it becomes unbearable. He decides to find someone to break the bond, but the only sorceress he knows who is strong enough to mess with destiny like that is Yennefer. Unfortunately for Jaskier, Yennefer appears to be wintering at Kaer Morhen with Geralt.

    Summary
      “Nilfgaard,” Jaskier said finally after what felt like an eternity. “Nilfgaard is going to start a war,” he said, the meaning of Borch’s words slowly becoming more and more clear in his mind. “They’re going to head for Cintra.” 
The dragon frowned. “Why would that affect you?” 
“There is someone there who has become very precious to me and whose fate also happens to be tied to the witcher. If she’s in danger… then so will he,” Jaskier said as he stood up, the restless energy trying to suffocate him. “You said something about time… time is slipping… I am running out of time - but to do what?” He rounded on the Dragon, his eyes wild. “What did you see? What do I need to do?”----
ORIt may have taken him 20 years, but Jaskier knows where he is not wanted. Now, armed with Borch's prophecy, Jaskier is faced with a choice; either walk away entirely and continue living his placid human life or return home, shed the human façade, retake his duties, protect Cirilla and likely run into the Wticher whose one request was for Jaskier to never cross his path again. 
He knows what the right choice is. What he doesn't know, however, is how much of him will be left by the time the dust settles.
