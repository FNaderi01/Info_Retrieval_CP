    Summary
      The story is set around after 2x20. Clary and Jace are back together. Simon is Clary's best friend and in a relationship with Maia. Some kind of destiny/soulmate thing. They make each other whole.Ever since he had bitten Jace, there was this feeling inside of him he couldn't really understand. It was that feeling of... addiction but in a completely different way than usual. There wasn't just lust for blood, there was much more about it. But whatever it was... Jace did not get it.

      He hated his wings. They were a reminder of how he’d shielded Izzy on her first mission instead of finishing the threat as he should have. A reminder of how soft and fragile Max had been in his arms when he was born.
A reminder of what he would do for his parabatai. Laws be damned.
The Law is hard, but it is the Law.
For Nephilim the decent into hell is easy. For the winged it was even easier.

    Summary
      Alec is a Muggleborn, Alec's parents hate that he has magic and tried to beat it out of him. They continue to abuse him for years, Alec's only escape is Hogwarts. But even there he has to deal with cruel pure bloods who despise him for being Muggleborn.  One night the abuse is so bad that Alec's parents almost kill him, but Harry saves Alec. Harry wants to send Maryse and Robert to Azkaban but because they never abused Izzy or Max no one will believe him apart from Draco who was the only other person to see Harry save Alec. Harry and Draco adopt Alec as his parents don't want him and Alec is afraid to live with them. Harry wants to adopt Alec's siblings too, but Maryse and Robert won't let them and Alec's siblings don't have magic. Being adopted by Harry Potter makes Alec famous but he hates the fame. Alec was always more comfortable in the shadows not the limelight. But he is shown parental love for the first time in his life which makes it worth dealing with the struggles of fame. Alec has had a crush on Magnus for years but has been too afraid to say as Magnus is from a pure blood family that hates Muggleborns. But Magnus surprises him by asking him out, Alec is wary at first but begins to fall for Magnus.

    Summary
      “Here you go, darling.” Magnus said, handing over the salt, his legs swinging on the counter. His smile was knowing and flirtatious.Alec swallowed and took the salt, his hands brushing against the warlocks fingers and his rings.“Thank you.” he simply replied, turning around quickly so Magnus wouldn’t be able to see his flushed face.“What about you?” Magnus now wanted to know, his tone light and conversational. “Well,” Alec started, his brain coming back to the food he was cooking. What did he have to do next? “Um, the uh… We had a demon nest near the Institute and one of them tried to get through the wards…”Alec trailed off when Magnus hopped off the counter, his steps light on the floor as he stood behind Alec, his body pressing against his.Magnus’ hands went around Alec and reached towards the pan that was before Alec and he took the spoon, stirring the mix and adding the tomato paste.“Oh?” Magnus asked, his breath tickling Alec’s neck.Right, yes, that was the next step.//[Day 10 of Flufftober 2020, Cooking]
