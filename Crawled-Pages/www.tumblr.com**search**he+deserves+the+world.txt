So I’m rewatching Iron Man 3, and I forgot about the part where Tony just asks Rhodey for his login info for a secure government database… and Rhodey just straight up gives it to him???Rhodey argues a little bit and says “I have to change [my password] every time you hack in,” but tells it to him a few seconds later anyway.Like… we all know that Tony is the guy who hacks into everything (”the pentagon in high school on a dare”), but we also know that Rhodey is supposed to be the “good one” of the two of them. He’s supposed to be the rule follower, the military guy, the one who follows authority figures.But he’s not. Sure he follows orders on the outside, but he also knows that to do what’s right, what will help people, you can’t always follow orders. He literally gives his best friend (a tech billionaire) the login information for secret government databases. This is something that could be extremely dangerous. It’s something that he would only give to his best friend, to the man he’s known for decades, the the man he knows will use it for good. Because anyone else, anyone who isn’t Tony Stark, would abuse that power. And how many times has he given this to Tony? He says “every time” like he’s done it more than a handful of times. It sounds more like dozens. And what other government databases has Rhodey given Tony his login info to? I just needed to talk about this because I think Rhodey and Tony’s friendship is often put on the backburner because of Tony’s friendships Bruce and Steve. Don’t get me wrong, I like Tony’s friendships with them, but He’s been friends with Rhodey for much longer and it needs to be talked about more.

            jeff atkins: skittles        Request: “please write more jeff atkins imagines”Pairing: Jeff Atkins x ReaderWarning(s): NoneWord Count: 373Gif: @titch-the-eskibro-banditA/N: Fair amount of my own headcannons. If you want to hear some of my headcannons, lemme know! [ Read pt 1 ] [ Read pt 2 ]It was Friday night. Jeff had picked you up from your house and cruised over to the Crestmont. He played his country music, mocking the deep accents. You had the window rolled down, your hair blowing in your face.Once you arrived, Jeff had bought tickets to the new thriller in town. You linked your arm to his, feeling his warmth.“Hey Clay,” Jeff fist bumped your brother. “She’s here, safe and sound.”Clay shook his head. He got the movie packet together, which consisted of two medium sodas, a large popcorn, red vines and-“Skittles?” Jeff looked at Clay. “I thought it was just red vines?”“Well, yeah,” Clay shrugged. “But y/n likes skittles. I won’t charge for that.”You gave your brother a small smile. “Thanks Clay.”“Of course,” he nodded. “Enjoy your movie.”Jeff held the large box in one arm, and even though he struggled, he still took your hand. Once you settled down in the middle of the theater, you ripped open the bag of skittles.You poured a few into your hand. You motioned your handful to Jeff.“You want?” You offered. Jeff chuckled, taking a few colors. He dropped them in all at once. Once he swallowed his sweets, he turned to face you.“What’s your least favorite skittles flavor?” He asked, not minding his volume at all.You widened your eyes at him. You folded your lips into your mouth. When he wouldn’t look away, you whispered to him your answer. He nodded, and took the bag of skittles. He took out all the colors that you claimed were not in your palate.You furrowed your brows. “What are you doing?” You whispered. His smirked, holding the solid color in his hand.“I’m getting rid of what you don’t like,” Jeff announced. He tossed the number of skittles in his mouth, squinting his eyes. “Apparently, I don’t like them either…” He coughed.You laughed into your hand, muffling your giggles. Jeff got to the point where he had to swallow the sugary treat. He sipped his cola, clearing his throat.“I will get rid of anything you don’t like, Y/N,” Jeff spoke, his voice raspy. “Unless I hate it too, then it’s up to Clay.”
