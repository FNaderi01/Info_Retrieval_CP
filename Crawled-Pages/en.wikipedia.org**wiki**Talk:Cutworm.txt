Untitled[edit]
I have 3 cut worms,green,brown,and orange.I give them lettice everyday they dont eta much because thats the only food in the tank so you should feed it all differint kinds of leavs and grass.to make a cut worm habitat you need:
-medium container(or bug container)
-sticks
-grass,leaves
-a sprayer(spray the tank every 3-4 days so it can have some water)
-some durt(they like hiding under the durtso if there gone in the morning check in the dirt) 
after you get all the right you will have a nice safe habitat for your cutworm.
