Edith Cowan University (ECU) is an Australian public university located in Perth, Western Australia. It was named after the first woman to be elected to an Australian Parliament, Edith Cowan, and is the only Australian university named after a woman.
ECU is situated in Western Australia, with more than 30,000 students at undergraduate and postgraduate level, approximately 6,000 of whom are international students originating from over 100 countries outside Australia.
ECU was granted university status in 1991 and was formed from an amalgamation of teachers' colleges with a history dating back to 1902 when the Claremont Teachers College was established, making ECU the modern descendant of the first institution of higher education in Western Australia.[4]
The university offers more than 300 courses across two metropolitan campuses, in Mount Lawley and Joondalup, and a regional campus in the South West, Bunbury, 200Â km south of Perth;[5] many courses are also offered for study online. Additionally, the university has partnerships with several education institutions to conduct courses and programs offshore.[6]
Amongst its divisions are the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts (WAAPA), an important performing arts training academy;[7] the School of Nursing and Midwifery, which offers a large undergraduate nursing program and the School of Education which offers a wide range of secondary teaching specialisations. The university also provides Psychology and Community Studies, and is home to the WA Screen Academy, one of Australia's leading film schools.
In the 2019 Student Experience Survey, the Edith Cowan University recorded the fifth highest student satisfaction rating out of all Australian universities, and the highest student satisfaction rating out of all public Western Australian universities, with an overall satisfaction rating of 83.3.[8][9]

History[edit]
  Edith Dircksey Cowan
The origins of Edith Cowan University date back to 1902 with the establishment of Claremont Teachers College, the first tertiary education institution in Western Australia.[4]
Other teacher training colleges were formed over the years, including Graylands Teachers College (GTC), the Western Australian Secondary Teachers College (WASTC), Nedlands College of Advanced Education (NCAE), Mount Lawley Teachers College (MLTC) and Churchlands Teachers College.[10]
In 1982 these colleges were all merged to form the Western Australian College of Advanced Education (WACAE) - with campuses in Churchlands, Nedlands, Claremont, Bunbury and Joondalup.[10]
Western Australian College of Advanced Education (WACAE) was granted university status on 1 January 1991[11] and changed its name to Edith Cowan University.[12]
Edith Cowan University was named after the first woman to be elected to an Australian Parliament, Edith Dircksey Cowan, and is the only Australian university named after a woman. Cowan worked tirelessly to raise funds for students to attend universities in other states, prior to a university being built in Western Australia, obtaining government support for her scheme.[13] Her work in this area was acknowledged by naming Western Australia's oldest education institution and newest university after her, as well as her image being added to the Australian $50 note.[13]
Cowan believed that education was the key to growth, change and improvement and her contribution to the development of Western Australian education was significant. She strove to achieve social justice and campaigned for the rights of women, children and families, for the poor, the poorly educated and the elderly.[13] She promoted sex education in schools, migrant welfare, and the formation of infant health centres, and was instrumental in obtaining votes for women in Western Australia.[13]
In 1991, the university purchased the house that Cowan, her husband and family had resided in for approximately 20 years.[14] The house was reconstructed on the university's Joondalup Campus[15] with the assistance of the West Coast College of TAFE,  and re-opened in 1997.[14] Edith Cowan House, Building 20 on the university's Joondalup Campus,[16] currently plays host to the Peter Cowan Writer's Centre.[17]

Governing council[edit]
The University Council is the governing body of the organisation which controls and manages the operation, affairs, concerns and property of the university, in accordance with its Corporate Governance Statement.[45]
The membership of the council is composed of people across various disciplines and groups as mandated under Part III, Sect. 9 of the Edith Cowan University Act 1984.[46]
Its membership includes persons appointed by the Governor of Western Australia, co-opted members, members of the academic and general staff of the university as elected by the members of these groups, and alumni and student guild representatives. With the exception of the Chancellor and students, members of council are elected for three-year terms, or in the case of a by-election for the balance of the current term. An elected member of the council may serve for up to three consecutive terms, after which they are subject to a twelve-month break before they may be reconsidered for council. Students elected to University Council hold office for a term of one year from the date their election takes effect, and are not eligible for re-election more than once.
Campuses[edit]
ECU has three campuses, consisting of two metropolitan campuses at Joondalup and Mount Lawley, and one at Bunbury, in Western Australia's South West Region. Programs are also offered at regional centres throughout Western Australia.
The Joondalup Campus[47] is the University's headquarters.[5] Facilities on the campus include a new Health and Wellness Building, a multimillion-dollar sport and fitness centre, a new award-winning library and student hub, an outdoor cinema screening Perth International Arts Festival Lotterywest Festival Films during the summer months and on-campus accommodation.[5] The campus also forms part of the Joondalup Learning Precinct, which includes the West Coast College of TAFE to the North and the Western Australian Police Academy to the North-east.[48] It is serviced by the Joondalup CAT and is close to the Mitchell Freeway.
The Mount Lawley Campus[49] is close to Perth's central business district. Facilities on the campus include extensive media training and performing arts facilities, a sport and fitness centre and on-campus accommodation.[5] The campus also forms part of the Mount Lawley education precinct with the Mount Lawley Senior High School and is home to one of Australia's most successful and well known arts training institutions, the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts.[50]
The South West Campus[51] is located in Bunbury, two hours drive south of Perth.[5] The South West Campus (Bunbury) is the largest university campus outside the metropolitan area and is part of an educational precinct comprising South West Institute of Technology and the Bunbury Health Campus[5] which includes St John of God Hospital and South West Area Health Services. The campus has modern facilities, small class sizes, two vending machines, a cafe and a common room. In addition, a comprehensive range of courses and on-campus accommodation is available.[5] Many classes have recently been to shifted to online to cater for overseas students.
The university formerly had two campuses in Perth's western suburbs - Churchlands and Claremont. These campuses were closed down in the mid-2000s with the Churchlands Campus becoming a residential estate[52] and the Claremont Campus being acquired by the University of Western Australia.
In 2014 the university opened[53] the ECU Health Centre on Dundebar Road in Wanneroo. The Centre includes the Wanneroo GP Super Clinic, ECU Psychological Services Centre, pharmacy and allied health practitioners.
On 20 September 2020, as part of a $1.5 billion deal between the federal and WA state governments dubbed the "Perth City Deal", it was announced that the Mount Lawley campus would be relocated to the Perth CBD, adjacent to Yagan Square. The campus, which will cost $695 million and include all facilities at the current Mount Lawley campus, will open in 2025. Mount Lawley Senior High School will expand into ECU's former land.[54][55]
