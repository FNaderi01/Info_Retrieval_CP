Abandoned Amusement Parks1. Prypyat Theme Park, Pryp‚Äôyat, Ukraine - This park was scheduled to open for the first time on May 1, 1986, but these operations were cancelled on April 26, when the Chernobyl disaster occurred just a few kilometers away. Since the disaster, moss levels within the park have been measured up to 25,000 ¬µSv/h, among the highest levels of radiation in all of Pripyat.2. Six Flags, New Orleans, LA - This park has been abandoned since Hurricane Katrina hit on August 29, 2005.3. Spree Park, Berlin, Germany - After closing, officials announced the park was insolvent. With debts at a level of ‚Ç¨11,000,000 remaining, the area has since fallen into disrepair. The owner has since been sentenced to seven years in jail for attempting to smuggle 180 kg of cocaine with a value of ¬£14 million from Peru to Germany in the masts of the Fliegender Teppich (Flying Carpet) ride.4. Nara Dreamland, Japan - This theme park near Nara, Japan opened in 1961 and closed on August 31, 2006 as a result of falling attendance.5. Camelot Theme Park, Chorley, England - Knights Leisure announced the closure of this park on 4 November 2012, blaming poor summer weather and competing events for a decline in visitor numbers.
