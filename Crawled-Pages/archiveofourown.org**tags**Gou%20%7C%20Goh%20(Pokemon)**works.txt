    Summary
      As Goh was trying to catch a Pokémon in the water (after Ash tied with Bea), Ash got an announcement that The World Coronation Series will be put on hold until further notice. This caused the two to be at the lab a little more often then normal. Goh notices Professor Cerise is acting a little secretive, and decided to investigate without Ash knowing. What he finds out will turn his life upside down... and it's up to Ash and many of his old companions to stop whatever Goh learned!
This entire story is a Prologue to a 'Betrayal' story that's different then what you're used to: Take an Extra Step, GOH the Extra Mile
The story also begins right at the end of "Satoshi VS Saito! Overcome Octopus Hold!" (Ash VS Bea rematch episode/Episode 39 of Pokémon Journeys.)
Also a cross-post with Wattpad (GreninjaGirlYuki) - Will have exclusive art there sometime after story is complete!

    Summary
      “Satoshi…” He whimpered, pressing his hands over his ears.“Gou? Is everything okay?”He didn’t respond, he didn’t hear him. Gou had sunken down to the ground in fear, clutching at his head. ‘I need you!’ Screamed his mind, his voice didn’t dare to say those words into the phone.Satoshi hung up.

    Summary
      Three lost souls find each other in a slightly different world, and from that moment, become something different. No longer thieves, they find the lost, abandoned, and broken, and do what they can to make them better.By force, if necessary.Or, Jessie, James, and Meowth are better delinquent heroes than they ever are as villains, and end up adopting a twerp as a little brother.Or, Ash travels with an aspiring nurse/idol/Pokemon trainer/princess, the Pokemon whisperer, and a talking Meowth (he still owes the leader of the Cerulean Gym a new bike).

    Summary
      Because of the idea her parents wanted a boy, Goh acted up like one since childhood and everyone believed she was one. Goh was happy with that, but while becoming older she began to feel uncomfortable and guilty because it was all just a lie. She decides to clarify the truth.Of course it's not easy to talk about her true feelings, but especially Ash is like a difficult obstruction. It's like a curse that there's no good time for Goh to have that important talk with him. But she doesn't know she's not the only one hiding secrets.

    Summary
      This time, Ash is going to be himself. That's a promise he made to Professor Kukui.That's very interesting to some people.
