    Summary
      Myra Owens was the sole ranch hand for the Adler Ranch and was like a daughter to the Adler family. But after a set of events, their lives are forever changed. Their home? Gone. Myra's father figure? Murdered. And what remained of the Adler residence were surviving with some honorable undesirables known as the Van der Linde gang, outlaws on the run from the authorities. As she lives alongside these people, Myra begins to feel a parental bond beginning to form with one member of the gang in particular, while also noticing the changes in her other parental figure. Is it possible for things to ever return to normal? Or is it too late to start again?
