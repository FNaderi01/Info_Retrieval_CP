The Boardroom (M)Pairing ⇥ Y/N works an uninspired job at a major marketing firm, and in the midst of your job applications, you found a different kind of job to entertain you or Executive!Jungkook x Assistant!reader Genre ⇥ Smut (Boardroom sex! Fingering, oral - male receiving, spanking, hint of sir kink, dirty talk, penetrative sex)Length ⇥ 5.3k_________________________________________________“Are you done whoring yourself out yet?”You huffed in annoyance, the lock of hair that had fallen between your eyes twitching before falling back into place. You couldn’t help but feel defeated as you glanced between the clock and the blinking cursor on the word document in front of you. Of course, Namjoon wasn’t helping matters. “I don’t think job applications are quite in the same league as ‘whoring’, Joon.” You muttered, grabbing your mouse to save the eighth unchanged copy of your resume.“You’re right, the difference is somebody actually wants what they’re getting.” You turned around to glare at the taunting voice, catching a glimpse of Namjoon as he lowered himself behind the cubicle wall with a snicker. You tossed a highlighter over the edge of it and smiled when you heard a soft 'ow!“."Seriously, Y/N, it’s 4:30, let’s go. Besides, if Seokjin catches you working on job applications at work again, you’ll actually need to whore yourself out to save your job.” “You’re repulsive, you know that.” But he was right. You’d been sending out job applications for months, with nary an interview to show for your efforts. It was a tiring process, and you’d already gotten your head bitten off more than once by Seokjin for it.Unlike previously thought, being an assistant at a high scale marketing company wasn’t all that glamorous or satisfying, but you’d been lured in by the decent pay check and brimming downtown core just steps away from your building. You’d yet to actually enjoy any of the sights downtown, but that was just how workaday life went. It wasn’t that you didn’t like your job, it was just wildly… okay. Your duties consisted of administrative work and replenishing refreshments at meetings, both of which a monkey could do, which Namjoon never failed to remind you.He was the only shining light of this place, and the only reason you hadn’t dumped Seokjin’s entire inkwell that he insisted on using right on the front of his Armani suits. Handsome he was, but not a very understanding boss. Hence, you were throwing yourself out into the job market once again. The real annoyance was when you found a job you really wanted, got attached, and heard nothing back. Unfortunately, that was the case once again. It was more of an established position than the one you had, albeit similar to your current one, but it gave more responsibilities and it paid better. The issue was, this was one of the most famous law firms in the country, Jung &amp; Jeon. There was no way they’d even look at your shoddy resume, the contents of which could fit on a post-it note.Namjoon appeared at your elbow, peering over your shoulder at the resume in front of you. It looked woefully empty. “You spelled proficient wrong.” “You know what!” You snapped, fighting back the smile at Namjoon’s laughter and the uselessness of the situation. You closed the document and shut down your computer, much to Joon’s pleasure. “Come on, Y/N, it’s not so bad being the sexy little assistant.” He slung an arm around you as you picked up your purse, your arm coming around his waist naturally. “Easy for you to say, you’re an accountant and you looove numbers. You don’t have to strut around in meetings asking if someone wants more coffee. Their hands don’t always just wander to the pastries, you know.” You grumbled, wrapping your scarf around your neck tightly. Namjoon’s arm tightened around you and spun you to face him. “Wait, seriously? Y/N, if that’s happening-”“No, Joon, I’m just being dramatic.” You saw the relief in his eyes, and you could kiss him for it. The best adopted work brother you could have. “I assure you, I can take care of myself.” You glared at his arm playfully, and Joon slid it off immediately, widening his eyes in mock fear. “Yes ma'am. Now, sushi!” You’d spent the rest of the evening trying to digest what felt like 30 dynamite rolls in your stomach, and working on your resume for the law firm. It wasn’t looking good. Jung Hoseok and Jeon Jungkook were elitists, only the finest grads ended up at their firm. Your marks weren’t bad by any means, but it wasn’t enough when the only other experience you touted on your resume was a waitressing job for a couple of summers. Really, you should be thankful for the job you had now, but you just… weren’t. You needed a challenge. With a big sigh, you submitted your resume without another thought, figuring that if it was meant to be, it would be. Besides, you had a big meeting to take care of tomorrow, filled with executives, and you had to get in early to make sure the coffee and catering was ready. Usually the meetings were smaller, around 5-8 people, but this one was so large you hadn’t even finished reading the guest list. You’d need to look nice. You rolled your eyes at yourself. You really were just a waitress in a pencil skirt. The morning started relatively smoothly, you’d gotten in before Namjoon, and even before Seokjin, who was a stickler for punctuality, so that was something. Maybe he’ll remember to put it on my reference letter, you snorted to yourself as you began brewing the coffee. Images of a huge board room filled with dusty old executives made you dread the day ahead. Couldn’t they get their own coffee? But no, Seokjin would be sitting in on the meeting and he preferred it when the company made efforts to make each guest feel tended to. “Like it’s a fucking hotel.” You whispered, popping your earbuds in and grabbing the tray. Turning the sound off on your phone, you wanted no interruptions as you stacked glasses, cutlery, and tongs onto a tray, silently mouthing the lyrics to the song blasting in your ears. Wheeling the utensils on a cart into the boardroom, you set up what you could before the catering came in, and returned to your desk to await the delivery. “Y/N!” You jumped three feet out of your seat as you hurriedly pulled your headphones out of your ears, your brain taking a second to pray that it was just Namjoon scaring you with his Seokjin impression again. It wasn’t. You peered up at the annoyed face of your boss and tried to stash your headphones away into a fist, though there was no point. He’d clearly seen them. “Yes, sir.” “I trust you’re using that phone of yours for things other than entertainment at work. Do you have the name tags ready?”“Uh- yes. Right here.” You patted a stack of pin-on name tags, alphabetically organized and ready to go. You looked back at him when you felt his heavy gaze still on you. “Wonderful. Where are the rest?” “The rest?” “Yah, Y/N…” Seokjin pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed deeply. “Yes. The rest of the last-minute RSVPs I just emailed you this morning to take care of. Try checking your email for a change, it’s the one thing I actually pay you to do. The executives are going to be here any minute and now half of them will not have name tags. How do you think that makes me look?” You suddenly felt like you were an inch tall. It was your fault, sure, but it was bad enough getting reprimanded, never mind getting yelled at for something as stupid as this. You could feel the tension throughout the few cubicles around you. Even Namjoon’s eyes were trained on his computer as though there were naked girls flashing on the screen. Traitor. “Sir, it’ll just take me a second-”“Don’t bother. They’re beginning to arrive. Just throw those ones out. We’ll have to make do, won’t we?” Seokjin huffed, fixing his tie as he stepped towards the reception area, where the pretty receptionist was standing, waiting to hand off the guests to Seokjin. He greeted them warmly like old friends, and you could almost glimpse a shred of humanity in the man. Too bad that humanity was going to disappear the second you were going to get fired. You groaned quietly and sunk deeper into your chair. The sound of plastic wheels moving and a pause made you look up against the back of your chair, where Namjoon was peering down at you from the edge of the cubicle wall. “That was rough. Why didn’t you see the email?” You silently pulled your phone out of your pocket, held it up, and turned the sound back on. The past notifications gleamed on your screen mockingly. “Ouch. You better make some damn good coffee today.” You smirked just to stop yourself from crying. It was lucky that the finance department was so close to Seokjin’s office, otherwise you would’ve never ended up by Namjoon. “Come on, pound it. Go get 'em tiger.” Namjoon held up his fist and you weakly pressed your own against it, groaning as you slid from your chair into a standing position. Time to go to work. Once the catering arrived, it was relatively simple from there on out. Plates of fresh fruit, muffins, and yogurts donned a nearby side table, as well as several coffee carafes. The executives trickled in slowly, helping themselves to their first cups and a few treats. You stood by the side until the meeting was meant to begin to make sure everybody had everything. Seokjin didn’t spare you a single glance, whereas he’d usually be at least giving you silent orders. He must really be pissed off. Pressing your back against the wall, you watched the men in their suits greet each other, shake hands, and discuss past meetings and future meetings. How very dull. The turnout was indeed higher than usual, and with so many unfamiliar faces and zero name tags, you prayed that nobody would ask you for details about Seokjin’s calendar. It was impossible to tell through his natural charisma and acting abilities, but your boss had feuds with nearly half the attendees. You’d innocently scheduled a lunch with one man, Jae, Seokjin’s apparent graduate school rival on your first week there, and you’d gotten your ass handed to you with a bow on top. Overall, you felt extremely unsettled as of late, and this meeting was doing nothing to calm your nerves. Resting your head against the wall, your eyes traveled to the doors on the other side, when something caught your eye. Among the well-dressed men and women in the boardroom, in walked a younger man, still a head taller than you, with smooth creamy skin, and large doe eyes. His black hair fell in his eyes as he walked in, but it looked clean and purposefully messy. Like he’d just gotten out of bed. He slipped into the crowd seamlessly, and you had to avoid tilting your head obviously to keep your eyes on him. His figure was lithe but muscular in a crisp black suit and black tie, and his biceps flashed for the brief moment when he shook somebody’s hand, revealing a cute smile. What was he doing here? A little young to be an executive, for certain. Damn, if only you had those name tags, you’d know who he was. You were too far from the crowds to hear him introduce himself, and it seemed that despite his young face, he was more well-known than you thought as many greeted him casually. This meeting just got a lot more interesting. “Don’t just stand there, offer some coffee.” You heard a hiss in your ear. Well, at least Seokjin was talking to you again, even if it was just to bark orders. You nodded and grabbed a carafe and a tray of glasses, offering coffee to those who stood without it. Consciously or subconsciously, you began to make your way towards the group where the black-haired man stood. He, two other men, and a woman were chatting quietly about a new deal involving the company. You were barely listening as you sidled up, silently offering the beverage until they paused long enough to look at you. Even then, they turned, took a cup, and held it out for you to pour. As you did so, you could feel the man’s eyes on you. You glanced up at him, and he smirked. His features were soft with a kind of graceful beauty, but his eyes were pitch black, and his jaw was sharp as a muscle worked within it. “Yes, thank you.” You poured the coffee carefully, careful not to let your hand shake as the cup filled with steaming liquid. You hadn’t even noticed him get closer to you. “Maybe you can offer me something sweet later as well.” He murmured, and the sound of his low honeyed voice shot straight to your core. You looked at his companions, but they were too immersed in their conversation to hear. You blinked owlishly but managed to offer a small smile as you twirled away with the carafe, feeling a tingle in your chest. The carafes eventually emptied, so you set on replenishing them in the boardroom kitchen. As the fresh coffee brewed, the executives trickled into the boardroom once again, so you were free to roam back to your desk for a few minutes. “Joon.”He grunted questioningly. “Joonie.”He grunted more insistently. “Joon-AH.” Namjoon slipped his glasses off abruptly and looked up at you, elbows placed on the edge of the cubicle wall, and chin resting on folded hands. His irritation could only be amusing to you right now. “Yes, my love. Did the coffee maker break again? Did you plug it in this time?”“Shut up, listen. There’s someone cute in that meeting.” Namjoon snorted, picking up his glasses again and wiping them off with his shirt. His warm skin still looked healthy and glowing under the fluorescent lights, and his blonde hair looked soft as ever. He was a gorgeous man; too bad you knew too well how much of a dork he was. “How old is he? 40? 50? Come on, Y/N, have the coffee fumes gone to your head?” “I don’t know, maybe 24?”“Is he another assistant?” “Didn’t seem like it, he’s sitting with the rest of them.” “Really? Impressive. Well then, godspeed. But don’t do anything stupid, you hear? I don’t need you getting canned today, I have financial statements to do. Thanks for the ‘cuteness’ update though.” He rolled his eyes as he replaced his glasses. You settled back into your chair for a while to wait out their coffees. Once the carafes and water jugs were filled, you piled everything onto a cart and slowly wheeled it into the room. The lights were dimmed due to the powerpoint presentation one of the guests was giving, but the flickering lights of the slides still allowed you to see their faces, namely the black-haired man’s. Picking up one of the carafes, you trailed around and topped off people’s coffees, careful not to obscure their views. You glanced up at Seokjin warily but he was thankfully immersed in the presentation; that was when you bent beside the gorgeous man to pour him some more coffee. In the darkness, with him sitting near the back, he had the perfect opportunity, and he took it. You could feel his large warm hand slipping over the outside of your thigh, and your eyes flickered to his face. He remained calm, face a mask, but you saw amusement in his eyes. His hand was patient and trained as it slipped over your skin, but just as quickly as it appeared, the absence of it left a cold rush over your skin. You missed his touch already. His eyes flickered to yours only for a moment, just in time to see the smirk on your lips, which seemed to satisfy him. Unable to linger, you continued on to the other members at the table until your work was done, but the thrum in your chest only grew as you stepped out of the boardroom. Pressing your back against the door, you gripped the carafe to your chest and let out a sigh. You’d never done anything like this before, especially not so blatantly at work. And with an executive! For all you knew, he was luring you in just to offer you up as a sacrifice to Seokjin. Though, why would he do that? He seemed kinder than that; you couldn’t miss the way his eyes watched yours the first time to see if he’d overstepped his boundaries. But you hadn’t exactly been subtle either, staring at him all agog from across the room. A crash of glass and voices chattering broke your reverie, and you spun around to face the door to the boardroom just as it opened. "Please, go on without me. It was a stupid accident.” The black-haired man stood before you, coffee coloured spatter covering the front of his white dress shirt. You sighed almost sadly; it was ruined and he had looked so good in it. His eyes caught yours and you found yourselves smiling as he eased the door closed. “If you wouldn’t mind leading me to the kitchen, Y/N, where I could find some club soda.” You sputtered for a moment, then nodded and pointed in the correct direction. As he slipped into the threshold of the kitchen, you bit your lip, and placed the carafe aside. “What a shame. It’s such a nice shirt.” You murmured, keeping your tone light as you watched him open the fridge, then close it with a plunk.  He held the bottle of club soda in his hands, and tore off some paper towel. “I’m not too torn up about it.” Something in his voice told you he really wasn’t. Probably had hundreds of them in his closet. “I’m Jungkook.” He fumbled a bit with the paper towel, his attempt at saving his shirt only half-hearted. You grabbed some paper towel and began dabbing at his shirt gingerly. You could already see the outline of his toned chest through the wetness of the white material and you bit your lip to concentrate on the task at hand. “I’m Y/N, I’m Seokjin’s assistant.” “God, you’ve got to stop doing that.” You heard him groan. You released your bottom lip with a small smirk. As your eyes flickered to the coffee stain again, your gaze returned to his. “This was no accident.” You said knowingly.  Jungkook tossed the sodden papertowel aside and shrugged his broad shoulders. “I don’t drink coffee. Had to get your attention somehow.” “How gallant of you.” “Didn’t leave me much choice, did you? Parading around in that tight little skirt, biting your lip constantly. Do you have any idea how tempting you look, Y/N? Takes a stronger man than I to resist.” His eyes carried that same glint again, and you found yourself pressing your thighs together at his words. “God, even now. You’re already all worked up. Sensitive little thing, aren’t you?” Jungkook stalked towards you like a predator, leaving you to back up against the wall like the willing prey you were. “Keep talking like that.” You murmured, fingers darting forward to grasp at his black satin tie. Pressing a hand by the wall next to you, he lowered his mouth to yours and kissed you intensely. Your body instantly reacted; a flood of warmth filled your stomach as your fingers reached up to tangle themselves in his hair. He pressed his hard, lean body into you, his thigh separating yours easily. “So needy, aren’t you?” He grunted softly, and you whimpered against his mouth. “When was the last time you were properly fucked, Y/N? Tell me.” You couldn’t breathe. His voice, low and hot in your ear, took away all of your senses. His hands slipped along your waist, tugging your blouse out from inside of your skirt. His huge black eyes caught yours and he smiled that sweet smile once again. “Never,” you panted. “Never got fucked properly.” He seemed pleased at that, his hand disappearing between your thighs to cup your heat. You whimpered at his knowing fingers brushing against your covered clit. “Until now,” he corrected. “Is there somewhere more private we can go so I can fuck my little slut properly?” “The.. the small boardroom on the other side. Nobody ever uses it.” “While I would love to let everybody hear you whimpering my name, begging for more, I’d rather not be interrupted.” He pressed his thumb into your clit for emphasis. “Me neither.” You sighed, hungry for his touch, but nodded your consent as he dropped his hand, and you tucked your shirt into your skirt again. The boardroom was across the office and you had to get there without raising suspicion. Once he’d managed to hide his erection decently well under his buttoned suit jacket, you opened the door to the servery and ventured outwards into the hall.You gestured for him to follow, getting only a few steps down the hall before you heard voices. You froze, paralyzed and mind racing to try to come up with an explanation. Namjoon appeared, head turned as he spoke to someone around the corner and out of your view. He glanced in your direction and you gestured for him to lead them elsewhere frantically. His eyes flickered to Jungkook standing behind you, still looking cool and calm you imagined, and his eyes flashed with understanding and panic simultaneously. “But before we go,” you heard him say as he turned to face the person he was speaking to. “Why don’t we go visit Min Yoongi? He’s the acting director, he’ll be able to-” you heard the voices trail off down the hall going the other way and you breathed a sigh of relief. Namjoon poked his head out from behind the wall for a split second with a pointed look. 'You owe me’, it said. You blew him a kiss playfully and he rolled his eyes, but caught it anyway. Just a few steps away where Namjoon had stood lay the boardroom, which Jungkook seemed to have found, judging by how his strong hand guided you inside. It was dark, the windows were uncovered but the cloudiness of the day gave you just enough light. “Bad girl, almost getting us caught.” You heard him say behind you. You turned around and saw the same smile on his lips. It was unnerving how the man could look so devastatingly sexy and yet so sweet at the same time. His black hair fell into his eyes, giving him the look of the former. You shivered. “What are you going to do about it?” You challenged with a smirk. He quirked a brow under his messy fringe in surprise. Your smile only grew in anticipation. “Does my little slut want to be punished?” He stalked towards you, and you backed up until you felt the edge of the table hit your butt. “Maybe.” Placing a hand on either side of you, effectively trapping you, he pressed a hot kiss to your lips. “Turn around, baby.” He hissed. With what little space you had, you turned around and bent forward, the table pressing into the tops of your thighs. You felt his hand atop your back to press you flat onto the surface. His hand squeezed your ass through your skirt and you let out a soft groan. “Shh, baby. Bite your sleeve.” “Why-” You let out a soft yelp when you felt his hand collide with your bottom. You felt your center flood with arousal as the warmth of the slap spread through your skin. You took his advice this time, biting down on the sleeve of your blouse as he swatted your butt again, pressing his clothed erection against the tightness of your skirt. You let out a soft whimper. “I know you can take more than this, baby.” His voice was sinful behind you, tempting you like only the devil could. You wiggled your bottom in response, trying to press up against him where you could. “You’re just eager for my cock, aren’t you? Greedy little girl.” He punctuated the sentence with another slap to your ass, the sharpest and most arousing one yet. “Please..” You felt yourself dripping, and he was right, all you could think about was the delicious way his erection was pressing into your ass. You couldn’t even recognize your voice as your own anymore, breathless and whiny as it was. “Not yet. On your knees.” The cool air rushed your skin as he stepped away, and you couldn’t help but rub your thighs together to try and alleviate some of the need. You desperately wanted to touch yourself, and though you would’ve loved to feel his hand against your ass again, you didn’t want any more distractions. “Look at you. So obedient.” He beamed as you sank to your knees, looking up at his gorgeous face, the way he bit the lower lip of his petal pink mouth, and you felt yourself flush. Making quick work of his pants and boxers, you gazed at the length of him, uncomfortably hard. “Be a good girl and suck me off. Maybe then I’ll reward you.” He smirked down at you, hair falling into his black eyes. His smile turned devilish. “Yes, sir.” You heard a groan fall from his lips already at the title, and you licked a wet stripe up the length of him. You felt him shudder, his lean form tensing as the warmth of your mouth encased his hard cock. “Fuck.” He hissed, his hands moving to tangle his fingers in your hair, though he controlled his thrusts. You hollowed out your cheeks, trying to take him as deep down your throat as you could, then twirling your tongue around his leaking tip. The weight of him on your tongue made the heat between your legs almost unbearable, and you sneaked a hand down to rub your neglected clit. “No touching, slut.” You whimpered as you pulled your hand away, feeling the burn return to your core as your orgasm lay farther and farther away. You instead concentrated on the feeling of his fingers tightening gingerly in your hair, the hardness of his thighs, and the softness of his skin as he began thrusting his hips forward. You gagged at the intrusion, and he pulled himself out with a groan, a string of saliva still connecting you to him. “Fuck, I want your mouth so bad, but I want to cum in that pretty pussy more. You’ve been so good for me, baby. On the table.” No longer caring how eager you looked, you shimmied out of your panties and hopped up onto the table. You were soaked; you knew it, he knew it, and the table knew it. He pulled you close to the edge, but pressed you flat onto your back. Taking your legs, he wrapped them around his waist, his warm hand stroking against your folds. You shuddered, letting out a wanton moan at the slightest contact. “God, you’re so wet. Was this just from the spanking? Or sucking me off? You’ve been such an obedient slut, and now I don’t even have to prep you. I could just slip right in,” You gasped at the feeling of one of his fingers slipping into you, glancing towards him to see satisfaction and amusement colouring his beautiful features. Damn, you hated him for being so smug, but the way he’d slipped in another finger and curled them just right - you whined as he pulled his fingers out.  Frustration began flooding you. Never mind, you did hate him. “So ready to be fucked at work, aren’t you? You don’t even care who might hear, you just want my cock, don’t you?” He pressed the tip of himself against your entrance and you almost sobbed in relief. “Yes, I just want your cock, please, Jungkook. Please fuck me properly like only you can. I’m your little slut- oh!” “How can I resist when you beg so prettily?” Tightening your legs around his waist, you felt your eyes closing at the feeling of his hard cock entering between your soaked folds, the relief a blessed feeling. You could almost see his smirk, even with your eyes closed. “Don’t get comfortable, baby. I said a proper fucking.” The pace he set was brutal; his hard cock pounding into you ruthlessly. His grip on your hips was hard as he kept you in place, and you tried your best to move your hips to match him, but it was of little use. He pressed you down harder against the table, and you let him use you the way he wanted. You wanted to scream at the feeling of his thrusts, his large, hot hands gripping into you. You tightened your legs and clenched around him, making his hips stutter.“Oh, fuck-” He hissed, and this time, you smirked. His payback was swift. With trained fingers, he found your clit and pressed his thumb against it, and you felt your hips rise from the table to the high heavens. Fiercely rubbing against it, you felt your eyes begin to roll back into your head as he gripped your hips harder, the sounds of skin slapping ringing out into the room. Your release was coming, you could feel it, and blessedly, Jungkook’s pace was holding steady. You let out a soft whine to warn him, though you were afraid he’d stop. “Is my little slut gonna cum?” You nodded, unable to form words as his thick length filled you over and over again. “Please,” you begged for good measure. “Please let me cum.” “Cum, baby.” He growled, and you felt the spring in your stomach tighten before exploding, his thrusts helping you ride out your high. You soaked yourself, fingers raking down the length of his arms. The pleasure began to ebb away, though, and his thrusts continued. Your relief lasted only a moment when he pulled out, cock still hard and reddened, but only long enough to flip you onto your stomach. There was a pause, and you could hear his roughened voice. “Can you take me to the end?” He held back to avoid overstimulating you until you peered over your shoulder with a smirk at how disheveled he’d become, the once proper businessman. His hair fell into his eyes, his forehead shiny with sweat. “Yes, Jungkook, fuck me.” He slid back into your swollen folds, and you yelped softly, hips wiggling from the sensation. “Come on, baby, I know you can take it.” His own voice sounded rough and fucked out. “I’m almost there, be a good cock slut for me, can you do that?”You whined but nodded, his hand pressing your back into the table as his cock entered you over and over again, pleasure soon bubbling inside of you once again. His fingers found your clit again, which, though sensitive, welcomed the attention. It wasn’t long before you were pushing yourself back up against him, hips meeting his thrust for thrust. “God, fuck, yes-!” You felt him shudder behind you, and the feeling of his hot cum spurting into you. The last few thrusts and the way his thumb and forefinger were tweaking your clit was enough to send you over the edge a second time, collapsing onto the table in a panting mess. You felt him slide out of you, but you were unable to move, unable to think. Pressing your cheek against the cold wood of the table, his hands lingered on your hips to steady you, and you felt him press a light kiss to your shoulder blade before releasing you. Your hot breath steamed the surface of the table as you tried to calm your heart to a normal human pace. You stood up and pulled your skirt back down, then found your discarded underwear and slipped them back on. You’d have to find some way to slip into the bathroom to clean up without being spotted now. “So, why are you working for Seokjin anyway?” You looked over at Jungkook, running his fingers through his hair to try and tame it. He already looked just as collected as before, whereas you felt like a mess. You snorted at his question. “The money, I guess. But I applied to a bunch of places elsewhere. Park Group, Kim Insurance, Jung and Jeon,” you listed off absentmindedly. Jungkook lifted his head from doing his belt and smiled at you, his bunny teeth peeking out from between his sweet smile. “Jung and Jeon, you say?” He fixed the cuffs of his shirt nonchalantly, still stained with coffee, then stuck his hand out for you to shake. “Jeon Jungkook. How would you like to come work for me?”

Icy sweat-drops ran down your back on the inside of the white blouse, probably making itself visible through the white colour. You were lucky your face wasn’t sweating - so you didn’t look greasy, but if you stayed for only some minutes more your entire body would be covered in an icy cold sweat. Is this what you’ve dreamed of? Well - the situation itself yes, but the way you ended up here? Not really what you thought would happen. With a gulp of spit mixed with vomit down your throat - you knew that whatever you tried to do, you wouldn’t get away from this situation.  Keep reading

You, his assistant, are new and bumbling and your mistakes, as well as your skirts, are driving him crazy.OR The one where Taehyung can’t survive without getting you out of your skirt.wc: 10,557warnings: smut. smut smut smut smut. a little bit of fluff because tae is fluffy. power dynamics, subtle dom!Tae/sub!reader (like blink and you miss it), unprotected sex (please practice safe sex), office sexual harassment (if this happens to you in real life please report them), lots of growling, spanking, fingering, edging, threat of orgasm denial, lite bondage (blink and miss it), “punishment”“Kim, report back to me after the 11 o'clock tomorrow.”The CEO’s voice was firm but quiet, not needing to be loud to command attention. CEO Kim Namjoon had recently taken over for his aging father, and Taehyung was thankful to be working under the younger man; the vibe in the office had shifted to one that was more relaxed, though still respectable.“Sir.” Kim Taehyung bowed his head before standing up from the large table, gathering his folders and the papers falling out of them, dismissed from the office after the morning briefing.Taehyung left the briefing room, walking down the hall to take the elevator down to return to his office, which was a beautiful glass windowed corner workplace. The elevator opened up to the 48th floor, and Taehyung stepped out.“Um, sir? Mr. Kim?” Your soft voice came from behind Taehyung as you followed him dutifully back towards his office. He paused his walk mid-stride, turning slowly to look back over his shoulder at you, an eyebrow raised into his blonde hair. He was tall, lean, and had the face of a model; easily the most attractive person you had ever had the pleasure of working under in your entire life. Keep reading

SO WTF ARE PEOPLE’S PROBLEM?! I HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN CRYING FOR SINCE I’VE FOUND OUTI love my husband so damn much and i’m literally heart broken right now.  Jungkook gives us so much and just wants us to respect not only him but his privacy and “army” can’t respect it?! I don’t care if we never get another update I just need him to be okay. Not over working himself and staying true to himself. I know people agree with me so please try and do this
