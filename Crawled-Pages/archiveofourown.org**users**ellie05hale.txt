    Summary
      Newt Scamander and the people (creatures, beasts, I'm pretty sure I can put anything sentient here) that get drawn into his life. 
A series of ficlets from different character's point of view that may, at some point, be connected or have a plot but as yet do not.
Also Pickett. Quite a bit of Pickett.
