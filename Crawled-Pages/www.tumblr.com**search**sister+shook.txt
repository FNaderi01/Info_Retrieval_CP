My mom likes to make it her life goal to make as many meme references as possible in the presence of my little sister Skye, for the sole purpose of annoying and embarrassing her.She also sends her heavily-filtered selfies on Snapchat. Skye hates it. It’s amazing.Skye also has a habit of telling stories of her day in an overly detailed and dramatic ways, and every single one includes the phrases “[Name] loves me.” and “I love [Name]. He/She is my FAVORITE.” and “We stan.”Basically, she’s great.Well today my mom sends Skye a venndiagram of this:My sister, of course, was sooo not amused. She showed her friend in what I’m sure was as attempt to get them to agree that “My mom is the worst” but [Insert friend name here] just laughed and said “Yeah that’s accurate.”Then I get home from work.And Skye shows me.And I die laughing because dude it’s so freaking true it’s hilariousAnd my mom looks all proud and giggles evilly (yes, evil; my mom is a proud Slytherin and totally adores the Evil Queen) about how embarrassed my sister is and she just:“That’s a heck of a laugh. See? She gets it! I win. I win the meme. I’m the meme queen.”Me? Dying.Mom? Victorious.Skye? Mortified. Hotel? Trivago.

            jeff atkins: i’ll treat her right        Pairing: Jeff Atkins x ReaderWarning(s): FluffWord Count: 119Gif: @titch-the-eskibro-banditA/N: Just felt like writing a cute fluff for this cute fluff. [ Read pt 2 ] [ Read pt 3 ]“Come on, Clay,” Jeff begged.Clay sighed, placing his arm in the center of the textbook. “Jeff, you’re not dating my sister.”Jeff shook his head. “Why not, Clay? Are you afraid I’ll like your sister more than you?”“No, it’s the fact that she’s my sister and you’re my friend. I can’t have my friend and sister dating. That’s, I don’t know… weird.” Jeff scoffed, leaning back in the chair. He looked around the library, seeing that you were a few tables away. “Clay, hey,” Jeff started. “Just give me a chance. I’ll treat her right.”Clay pinched the bridge of his nose. “Fine, ask her out.”Jeff’s jaw dropped. “Seriously?”Clay nodded. “Before I change my mind.”
