The sun was beaming through the curtains which produced a warm glow on their faces and lit up the room. They were in complete bliss. “Mmmm are ye really here? Or am I dreaming?” Sam’s eyes were still closed as he held onto her tight. “If you’re dreaming then so am I. And if so, I never want to wake up.” Cait snuggled into his neck, kissing him there and breathing him in. Sam lifted her chin, brushing away a few strands of hair covering her face, and softly kissed her forehead. He then moved to the bridge of her nose and then her lips. “This is simply the best way to wake up. I’ve dreamed about this since the day you left. To finally be here in your arms. It’s everything.”“And the day is just getting started,” Sam whispered in her ear.“The sun feels so good on my face. I can’t believe it’s going to be in the 80’s here today and it’s in the 40’s at home! That’s it, I’m never leaving.”“Oh don’t tease me like that, Balfe, because you know I will happily hold you to that!” Sam’s chest twitched under her and she knew he was smiling. “How about we make some omelets for breakfast and then head out to Lion’s Head?”“I am quite famished,” Cait said, looking up at Sam with a playful gaze. “Oh there’s always time for that,” Sam said, biting his lower lip. He took her right then and there. “Well now I’m really famished,” Cait giggled as she rolled off of him. “What a coincidence, now so am I! For food this time.” Sam winked and planted a firm kiss on her lips as they got up and headed towards the kitchen.They finished up breakfast and filled their backpack with some snacks, sunscreen and water.They arrived at Lion’s Head by late morning and began the climb up to the top. It was pretty steep in some parts, so Sam kept a hand on her lower back in case she stumbled.“Umm Sam, my back is a bit higher up.” Cait laughed not minding at all.“Oh did it slip down to your perfect arse? My apologies,” Sam said, smiling so hard his nose scrunched.It was so crystal clear out, you could see for miles. The ocean was a magnificent blue with what looked like a turquoise glow along the edge by the shore. “This is the most beautiful view I’ve ever seen!” Cait’s mouth was agape, looking from left to right and spinning herself all the way around in awe, like a kid in a candy store not knowing where to look first. “Have you ever seen anything so beautiful in your entire life?”“Aye,” Sam responded, lost in her, softness in his voice.She gave him a playful shove, a blush emanating from her cheeks. “You are the most romantic man I’ve ever known.” “You make it verra easy,” Sam said through a smile as he took her hand, bringing it to his mouth and kissing her palm. “Now be careful over in this part, it can get a wee bit slick with all the rocks and sand clumped together.”Just as he said that, Cait slipped and braced herself with her hands, her knees skimming the rocks.”“Ouch! You weren’t kidding.” Startled, Sam quickly bent down to help her up. “Are ye all right, love?” “Barely even felt anything, I have knees of steel,” she said with a smile albeit a slight grimace.“Shall we go back?” Sam looked concerned.“I’m ok, really! Let’s keep going. I never feel any pain when I’m with you. But I think I’ll be holding your hand from here on out.”“Oh I can happily oblige with that request, milady.” Sam bowed and held out his hand.“I love how dorky you are,” Cait laughed as she slid her hand into his, their fingers interlocking. They continued to hike up to the highest point, taking in the scenery and a few selfies as well. They stood by the edge of an outstretched rock formation and Sam got behind Cait, wrapping his arms around her, kissing her neck. “Wow, this is the most beautiful view with the most beautiful woman. I still can’t believe you’re here!”“And you still have me for another two weeks,” Cait said as she laid her head back on his chest, turning her face up to gaze at him as Sam pressed his lips against hers. “So besides my clumsy nature, this was a perfect idea. And a perfect day.” “The day’s not over yet,” Sam said with a wink. They spent some time up at the top, walking around and taking a few moments to relish in the view and in each other.  They took some silly selfies and lots of pics of each other and the scenery. They then sat down for a while, nibbling on some protein bars and water, while resting their legs before the trek down.When they arrived back at Sam’s place they went out on the balcony and had a glass of wine. The air had gotten slightly cooler and the breeze felt so good against their body after the hike. “I could get used to it here,” Cait said with a deep sigh. “On second thought, I could get used to anywhere as long as I’m with you.”Sam reached over and gently stroked the back of her neck. Cait’s hair was still in a ponytail from the hike, and she was glistening. “Sam, I’m all sweaty back there.”“Like I would ever mind? You’re even sexier when you’re all sweaty, if that’s at all possible. He pulled her chair closer to him, and softly kissed the nape of her neck. “Mmm salty,” Sam said as he trailed his tongue up towards her ear.”“That tickles.” Cait shuttered as she instinctively brought her shoulder up to her ear.“I have an idea,” Sam said with a wistful look in his eye. “Oh yeah? What’s that?”“It’s a surprise,” he said as he got up and started to walk back into the living room.“Wait, where are you going?” Cait furrowed her brow, wondering what he was up to. “Give me five minutes and I’ll come and get you. Stay right there though. No peeking.”“Sam Roland Heughan, what are you up to.” He gave her a look. “Ok, ok, I’ll stay put.” And with a wink, Sam was gone.Five minutes later, as promised, he came back out onto the balcony and got Cait. He put her wine glass down on the table and took her hand, leading her through the living room and down the hall into the bathroom. Cait’s eyes widened as she saw candles lit, and a bathtub full of water with suds building up along the sides of the tub.“You drew me a bath?” Cait’s voice was all high and squeaky. “Babe, I love this so much.”“I thought you could use a nice warm bath to soothe your body after that stumble, and clean off those scraped knees. And selfishly, I want to bathe you.” Sam put his arms around Cait from behind, squeezing her tight, planting a kiss on the cheek. “It’s perfect. You’re perfect. I guess I won’t be needing any of these sweaty clothes anymore.”“Allow me. It’s all part of the plan,” Sam said with a smirk.Sam slowly and methodically helped Cait off with her T-shirt, pulling it up over her head, followed by unclasping her sports bra and sliding it off, as well. He took out her hair tie, and her waves fell amongst her shoulders. Cait slid her bottoms off and turned to face Sam. “All ready! Bathe away.” And as she was standing so close to him, she could tell he was ready for something else entirely.“In you go.” Sam held her hand as she stepped into the warm, soapy water.  She sank down into the tub with a pleasing moan as the water came just below her shoulders, barely covering the tops of her breasts. Sam was kneeling down beside the bathtub. “Mmm this feels amazing. You’re too good to me,” said Cait, turning towards Sam with her eyes closed as a smile radiated from her face.  Sam moved closer so their foreheads were touching, and instinctively their noses grazed against each other back and forth ever so slightly. “So how do those knees feel now? They look a little better than earlier.” Cait had her legs bent so her knees were now above the water. Sam leaned into them and gently kissed each one. “All better now. Your kisses work wonders. They’re magic. I’m cured!” Cait giggled as she caressed his chin, the scruff thankfully still prevalent on his face even after getting it cut for his new film. She loved the feel of his beard, especially as it brushed over her lips and face. He leaned over to kiss her, lingering as he always did on her lips. “Oh do they now? Where else might my kisses work wonders?” A mischievous expression crossed Sam’s face. “Oh I think you know,” Cait answered back, grabbing his hand and placing it between her legs. Sam caught his breath, letting out a sound from deep within.He began to pour water over her back and shoulders, using a yellow ceramic pitcher he found in the cabinet. He filled back up and continued around to her front, spilling it over her neck and breasts. His other hand was quite occupied at the moment, with Cait squirming beneath his fingers. “Two questions,” Cait began, finding her breath….”why are you wearing all those clothes, and why are you not in here with me?”“Aye. Two verra good questions. I like tending to you in this way, being able to see all of you, and how enjoyable you feel right at this moment. But, I do believe there is room in there for me,” Sam said with a crooked smile.“Plenty of room. And if not, I’ll slide back up against you so we conserve more of the space.” Cait’s cheeks were beginning to flush at the thought. “Well aren’t ye the most thoughtful.” “I aim to please, sir.” And with that, Cait reached over and lifted his shirt up over his head. “Well this is a good start,” she continued. “Now off with those shorts.”Sam did as he was told, and once completely naked he stepped into the tub behind Cait. “Well now I’m enjoying this view quite a bit,” she blushed.Sam slid in behind Cait, his legs outstretched in front of him with Cait leaning back between them.  He grabbed a small towel sitting at arms length on the counter, dipped it in the water and rubbed the bar of soap on it. He brushed Cait’s hair away from her back and ran the soapy towel over her shoulders and neck, moving down to her back. He then glided his hand along her back, feeling her smooth skin as the soap began to foam on her body. “Oh you can do that all night if you’d like. It’s ok if our skin becomes like a prune. You sitting behind me, thighs squeezing onto me and rubbing your hands against my skin? Yes, keep going please.”“As you wish.” Leaving the towel hanging over the tub, Sam’s hands then traveled around to her front, massaging her breasts, then sliding up to her neck and back down; the soap making everything more slick. He cupped her breasts again, squeezing gently and circling his finger around her nipples. Cait’s hands were under the water massaging his thighs, feeling him quite aroused behind her. Grabbing the soap from Sam, she lathered up her hands and reached back, caressing his face, neck and shoulders. His hands were still all over her body, now traveling down to her thighs, grabbing hold with a fierce need, while pushing himself against her. “Have I thoroughly bathed you to yer liking?” Cait reached behind her back, grabbing for him. “Oh that you did. You tended to me quite well. Allow me to return the favor,” she said as she slid her hand up and down his shaft, Sam biting into her shoulder with every stroke.Cait lifted herself up, knowing it wouldn’t be so easy in the water, and attempted to slide onto him. “Ok, this isn’t as easy as I was hoping,” Cait groaned as she just couldn’t manage to slide down. Damn water makes it difficult.”“Hmm how about if we try something new, with the hopes we don’t go toppling off the tub.” “I’m game,” Cait said with a quizzical look on her face. “The water is umm, quite drying, which is quite the oxymoron, but in this case it’s true. How about if I sit on the ledge of the tub, legs dangling in the water for support, and you sit on me the same way. I won’t let ye fall.”“I will try anything with you which results in you inside of me.” Sam stood up and sat on the ledge, grabbing the soap and lathering up his hands which he then covered on his member.“Oh I like this idea,” Cait said as she stood up, back to Sam, and slowly sat down right on him. They both let out a moan as Cait flexed her hips up and down while Sam held onto her, arching his pelvis simultaneously. Cait grabbed at his thigh with one hand and pushed her other hand against the wall. She was panting, her legs tiring, but she completely ignored the strain. “You come up with the best ideas,” she said as Sam’s hand traveled to her front, his fingers teasing her. It didn’t take long for both to find their release. Cait collapsed down on Sam, her full body weight on top of him.While in bed, in their post sex glow, Sam reached into his nightstand drawer and pulled something out, keeping it tucked in his hand.“I have another surprise for you,” he said with an almost shy demeanor. “Another surprise? You’re spoiling me, Sam.”“Oh I hope so.”Cait saw his hand clasped around something and propped herself up on her elbow, grinning from ear to ear in anticipation. Sam scooted himself up on the bed so he was sitting a bit more upright.“I got something for you soon after I arrived here in South Africa. Not to sound too cheesy, but,” Sam continued as he opened his hand. “It’s a promise ring. No matter how far apart we are, it’s always going to be you.”Cait’s face was one of pure surprise and awe and happiness all in one. The ring was stainless steel with hearts etched into the band going all the way around. “Oh my gosh. Sam, it’s so beautiful. I love it so much. I love YOU so much.” She sat straight up, grabbing his face with both hands, kissing him hard on the mouth.“I love you more,” he said as he slipped it on her right ring finger. “I know the distance is difficult, but whenever you’re feeling lonely or if you ever doubt how much I love you, just look down and you’ll know.”“I’ll never take it off,” Cait said as she twirled it around her finger, amazed at this man in front of her. Sam brushed her cheek with the back of his fingertips, stopping at her mouth, gently pulling her bottom lip down with his finger. His mouth closed in on hers and they sunk back down into the bed, completely lost in each other, both knowing that this, what they have together, is forever.

The treetops lining the streets were covered in white powdery snow, and there were colorful holiday lights draped around lampposts, tree trunks and door frames of apartment buildings. Manhattan is such a magical place in winter. As Caitriona walked around Central Park, bundled up in her puffy ski jacket with scarf and hat, she wished Sam was walking next to her, holding her hand. Central Park will always be their place. That’s truly where she fell head over heels for this man who sat on the other end of that bench.It had only been 2 weeks since Sam left, yet for Cait it easily felt like 2 months, if not longer. She missed his smile, his touch, how he made her laugh so hard without even trying. They spoke and texted as much as they could, but the time difference was becoming increasingly difficult, especially with his busy filming schedule. Cait had kept busy with auditions and meetings, but the nights were the hardest.Lost in thought, Cait felt her phone vibrate in her pocket and reached in to pull it out. Her face lit up as she fumbled off her gloves to answer the call.“Sam!”“Hi beautiful.” Sam’s voice was soft and she could tell he was smiling as he spoke.“Oh babe, it’s so great to hear your voice. I miss you so much.” Cait was grinning from ear to ear. Just the sound of his voice made everything better.“I miss you more.”“I don’t see how that’s possible,” Cait said as she found their bench and sat down.“Guess where I am right now?”“Naked in bed?” Sam said with utter delight.“Haha no. But I like where your mind is. Alas, it’s only 2pm here. And being in bed isn’t quite the same anymore without your body next to mine.” Cait sighed audibly.“What I wouldn’t give to wrap my arms around that body of yours right now.”“It kinda feels like you are at this moment. I’m sitting on our bench, where we met. Where, you know, you fell hopelessly in love with me at first sight.” Cait giggled.“Mmmm I miss that giggle. And did I now? I believe it was you who couldn’t keep yer eyes off of me, Balfe.”“I wish you were here with me right now and I’d show you how much I couldn’t keep my….hands off of you.”“Oh Cait, I wish that more than anything too,” Sam said as he let out a deep guttural groan.“So tell me, how’s filming going? How’s South Africa?”“It’s been great so far! Long days but it’s such a fun experience. And South Africa is heaven. It’s so incredibly beautiful. Speaking of beautiful, when am I seeing your face?”“I thought you’d never ask.” A wave of happiness flushed through her body at the thought of seeing him. She felt a warmth permeating through.“If I had my way I’d have ye here with me every day. And night. I go to bed thinking about you and wake up the same.”“Is 2 weeks from now soon enough?” As cold as it was on that park bench, Cait didn’t even notice. Seeing him and being with him again was all she could think about.“Nope. Not soon enough at all. But I’ll take it!” Sam could barely contain his excitement. It’ll be a month since they last saw each other, in the flesh, and it was a month too long.“I’ll be counting the days. I can’t wait to see you. I love you.”“I love you more.” Sam kissed the phone and hung up.Two weeks surprisingly flew by. Cait boarded her flight and knew she should sleep but was too excited at the thought of seeing him in a handful of hours. She was finally going to be back in his arms, exactly where she belongs. This last month without him was torture.The plane touched down and she pulled out her phone and texted Sam.Guess who’s in South Africa?!Guess who’s waiting at baggage claim?!Cait could barely stand it. She couldn’t get to him fast enough. She felt like the plane was taxiing forever. It finally pulled up to the gate and the doors opened. She was sitting quite forward in the plane for this very reason…so she could get to him as quickly as possible. Cait was wearing black baggy pants that tapered at the ankle, grey suede booties, a white tee shirt and her black leather jacket. She hurried down the hallway and onto the escalator. She continued to follow the signs to baggage claim, and there he was. Looking as handsome as ever with the biggest smile on his face, and holding a sign that simply said ‘Mo Chridhe.’ “My heart,” she mouthed, clutching hers.Like right out of a movie, they sprinted towards each other, Cait leaping into his arms, legs wrapping around him. Sam spun her around, kissing her hard on the lips. “I can’t believe you’re finally here!” Sam was out of breath and smiling so hard. She dropped her legs to the floor and stood there holding him, eyes filling with tears. “Look at you with this dark, short hair,” she said as she ran her fingers through his curls, which were still making an appearance. “I love it. So handsome.” She softly kissed his lips, their foreheads now touching. “Let’s grab your luggage and get outta here, shall we?”While waiting for the luggage to drop, Sam and Cait couldn’t keep their eyes off each other. She was leaning into him as both arms were around her, holding tight. His face was buried in her hair, breathing her in. Cait’s luggage came out right away and off they went.They got back to Sam’s place in just under an hour. They talked and talked in the car, fingers interlocked the entire time, catching up and stealing kisses at the red lights. They finally arrived at his place and he grabbed her suitcase out of the trunk and wheeled it up the path to his apartment building. He was on the top floor, with a beautiful balcony view overlooking the marina with sailboat after sailboat all in a line. “It’s absolutely beautiful here, Sam.”“Just wait until you see the view from the balcony.”He unlocked the door and held it open as Cait walked thru first. Placing her suitcase just inside the door, Sam grabbed her from behind, his arms enveloping her, traveling up and down her body with a fiery passion. He couldn’t wait any longer. Closing the door behind him, Cait whipped around and pushed him up against the door, their lips and tongues finding each other in a matter of seconds. Sam grabbed hold of Cait’s thighs and lifted her up, her legs locking around his waist.“I’ll give ye the tour later, Mo Nighean donn,” he mutters breathlessly into her ear. “Oh, right now the bedroom is the only room in this place I wanna see,” she whispers back.He carries her down the hallway into his bedroom, not breaking stride, nor lip contact. Panting and pulling at each other’s clothes, they both topple into the bed. Sam rolls her over and gets on top, moving her hair out of her face, sweeping it behind her ear. He looks at her as if it’s the very first time and he can’t believe this perfect woman is his. He slowly and methodically unbuttons her blouse, not taking his eyes off her, exposing her black lace bra. He presses his mouth against her breasts, moaning with each kiss. Cait begins to stir under him, her pelvis reacting to his touch.“Oh God, I want you so badly,” Sam utters with barely a breath to be had. “I’ve thought of nothing but this since the first night we were apart. Do ye want me?” Without a word, Cait grabs his shoulders and pushes him over, rolling on top of him, pinning him to the bed. She grabs hold of his member, which is throbbing with want and anticipation, and guides it under her. Sam’s hips shift in upwards, entering her quickly as he grabs her buttocks and pushes himself deeper inside. Cait’s moans become louder and louder. He has perfect view of her breasts as he continues to fondle them, reaching back to unhook her bra as it falls on top of him. He sits up, taking her nipple into his mouth, his tongue flicking away. Uncontrollably, Cait reaches into his hair as she pulls his face closer, Sam now moving to her other breast. Arching her back at the sensation, she continues to gyrate on top of him, both of them moaning with pleasure.“What was your question again? Do I want you? Have I sufficiently answered that?” Out of breath and beads of sweat forming on her brow, Cait smiles as she continues to flex her pelvis up and down.“Oh aye, you have answered that verra well indeed.”They spent the next two hours in bed, two becoming one, buried in each other’s arms making up for lost time. Sam had a full week and a half off from filming due to the holiday and he was going to spend every single minute of that with Cait.“So are ye tired or do you want to go exploring today? I want to take you to the most beautiful spot here in Cape Town. It’s called Lion’s Head. We’ll go for a wee hike! Ok, so it’s not quite wee, but it’s so beautiful.”“I’ll go anywhere with you,” Cait said as she smiled against his lips.

                                                            When the Wind Blows
                                                                ch 1 / ch 2 / ch 3 / ch 4 / ch 5 / ch 6Chapter 7 - Don’t forget about meThe sky was ominous, with thick dark clouds forming above. The wind was beginning to whip. The air was thick. A storm was approaching at full speed. It mirrored exactly what Sam and Cait were feeling inside, knowing that when they woke, it would be the day they’ve been dreading from the moment they met.  It was 7am and Sam and Caitriona were together, arms and legs enveloping one another in bed, sleeping soundly, at peace. From the looks of them you’d think they had at least another 3 months together in each other’s arms. The window was slightly ajar and a whistle was emanating through the screen, as the wind was becoming even more fierce. The rain was beginning to pour down. Sam woke up first. Eyes flickering, moving back and forth under his eyelids. Her beautiful face was right in front of him when he finally opened his eyes. A smile formed across his lips. She was the love of his life. He exhaled heavily and wisps of her hair slightly moved over her face. He gently swept them away and caressed her cheek, not wanting to wake her just yet. “I wish we could stay in this moment forever,” he whispered, mouth squished into the pillow, eyes still locked on her. Caitriona stirred, but was still sound asleep. Sam’s arms were still around her, and he gave her a light squeeze. His eyes shifted to the window as he got lost in the sound of the rain hitting the window almost like a tapping sound, as the tree branches rattled around. The storm was due to pass by late afternoon, well before his 9pm flight. “How long have you been awake?” said a raspy voiced Cait, catching Sam off guard. “Good morning, beautiful,” he said with a smile as he leaned over to her lips. “Not long. I was enjoying watching you sleep so peacefully.”“I wasn’t drooling or anything, was I?” She brought a hand up to her mouth just in case.“Ha. No, not at all. And I’d still find that sexy, even if ye had been.”“Liar.” Cait giggled and tightened her grip around him as he kissed her on the nose. He pulled her closer and they lay there listening to the storm brewing outside.“You know, this is the perfect day to stay in bed,” Cait said as she lifted her face up to his and tucked a stray curl behind his ear.“It’s as if ye read my mind,” Sam happily replied as he pulled the covers up over them both. Their legs were still intertwined and Cait began to rub his back with her free hand, as the other one was tucked against his chest. Sam reciprocated with the same. No words were spoken as they let their hands and bodies do the talking. They began to kiss passionately, their tongues moving about together in a rhythm almost like a dance. In one swift move Cait rolled on top of him, pinning his shoulders down. “Mmm so this is what ye had in mind, aye?” An amused expression crossed Sam’s face.“Among other things,” Cait said in a playful tone.  She began to run her fingers gently up and down his chest, stopping briefly to circle  around his abs. “You feel so good,” Cait breathlessly uttered as continued to trace down towards his member, slowly moving her hand up and down in a teasing manner.Sam’s hands were in turn all over Cait, running up and down her back, moving to her front.“Aye, you feel good too.” Sam moaned with pleasure as his fingers were now inside her, in and out, teasing her right back. Cait’s body began to tremble with pleasure, as she gyrated on top of him. She held herself up, putting her hand on his stomach as she arched her back. With her other hand she grabbed for him, and guiding him towards her, lifted her hips and slowly sat down, letting out a guttural cry as she did so. He slid deep inside, filling her whole. Sam’s eyes closed immediately and his face was one of complete euphoria as he reached for her hips, his pelvis rising and falling with every stroke.  Neither of them wanted to finish too quickly, but instead just be with each other, feeling every bit of the other in this way for as long as they could.Afterwards, they fell back asleep, Cait in the nook and Sam’s arms fully encircling her. When they woke up again a couple hours later, the rain was beginning to taper off and the sun was starting to peak through the clouds. Rays of light were hitting the window and the white curtains began to look iridescent as the room got brighter. Sam squinted from the rays pushing through the curtains as he slowly opened his eyes. “Och, I guess we’d better get a shower and have some breakfast.” “Mmmmm I suppose we should,” Caitriona grumbled. “I am getting quite hungry after our morning workout,” she winked as she burrowed her head into his neck.“And tis my favorite morning workout to do with you. Heck, morning, afternoon, evening, nighttime…take your pick.” Sam kissed her forehead and playfully patted her on the bottom. “All of the above, thank you very much. Why choose just one.” Caitriona lifted her head and pressed her lips against his.They spent the entire day together, not talking much about the inevitable, but instead living in the moment and enjoying each other. “So…ummm…do you need help packing? What time do we have to leave for the airport?” Cait’s eyes sloped downward and her shoulders began to sag.Sam lifted up Caitriona’s chin and his lips covered hers. “I pretty much got all my packing done the night you were filming. I only have a few items left to squeeze into the suitcase. Let’s see, it’s only 4pm, so I’d say we should probably leave in a couple hours.”Cait helped him pack up the last bit and piled everything by the door. The rain had now dissipated and the sky turned blue. It felt like a completely different day than the one they woke up to. Sam walked over to the sound system and put on some music. “May I have this dance?”“You are truly the sweetest, most romantic man I’ve ever met.” Cait took his hand and he guided her into his chest. She put her head against him and they swayed slowly to the music. She could hear his heart beating as she closed her eyes and lost herself in him. Sam’s arms were wrapped tightly around her.  ……They arrived at the airport and walked over to the waiting group of chairs right before the escalator would take Sam up to security. This is where they would part.They both let out a deep sigh and smiled, but not with their eyes. Sam tucked a piece of her hair behind her ear, sliding his fingers into her hair, landing on the back of her neck.He pulled her close and wrapped his arms around her, not wanting to let go. Ever. “Don’t forget about me,” Sam said with a hitch in his voice. He wasn’t very serious but yet there was a sadness and honesty in his voice. He knew they would stay in touch every day via text and FaceTime whenever possible. But it wasn’t nearly the same as actually feeling her and seeing this beautiful woman right in front of him whenever he wanted. Cait grabbed hold of him even tighter, trying to fight back the tears….“As if I could even if I tried. Which I would never ever do. You have my heart. And I know you’ll always keep it safe. As I will with yours. You’re never gonna be far away from me.”They pulled back, arms still in place, locked behind each other’s back. They were now face to face. Both had watery eyes, and a single tear rolled down Cait’s cheek. Sam leaned in and kissed the tear away, then moved over to her lips.“Well now you’re all salty,” she giggled through tears. Sam smiled, licking his lips. “Aye, and it’s verra good salt.”“You dork,” Cait quipped. “A dork who loves you,” Sam said with such a tenderness in his voice.Simultaneously they’re hands slid down from each other’s back and they clasped, interlocking fingers and squeezing tight. Sam brought her hand up to his mouth and just held it there, lips pressed down, breathing her in. “You’ll text me right when you land, right? Even if I’m sleeping, please do or I’ll worry. Although I don’t know how much sleep I’ll get without you beside me.” “I promise. I miss you already.” Sam reached his hand up and palmed her cheek, gently rubbing her lips with his thumb. She kissed his finger as he paused on her lips. “Kiss me, Cait. But not a last kiss by any stretch. Just until the next.”  She sunk into him and wrapped her arms around his neck. They kissed like no one was watching, even though they were in an airport filled with people. Neither of them cared. They finally parted, foreheads pressed against each other.  “I guess you’d better go,” Cait said, voice shaking.Sam held onto her hand as he slowly walked away. Fingertips touching until the last moment.Sam smiled as he got on the escalator. “I love you,” he mouthed as he then disappeared from sight.Sam got settled in his seat as the plane doors were about to close. He stared out the window, reliving those last moments with Cait.  Before he knew it the plane was taking off and he would be in Scotland in the morning.He reached into his bag for his headphones. As he was rummaging through he heard a crinkling sound and pulled out an envelope.His name was written on the front with a heart surrounding it. “A letter from Cait,” he said to himself, face lighting up. She must have slipped it into his bag while he wasn’t looking.Sam took a deep breath and opened the envelope. They were now above the clouds, climbing to 35,000 feet. Dear Sam,Right now you’re probably thinking, when did she sneak this letter into my bag? Let alone when did she write it? Seeing as how you and I have pretty much been together for 3 straight months almost every single day, but you know me…I’m sneaky when I want to be! And I love surprising you as much as you love surprising me.  It’s also possible I snuck a few pics of you on my cell while you were sleeping the other night. Don’t give me that look, Heughan. Now when I go to sleep I can look at you and it’ll be like we’re together.  Of course I’d much prefer that sexy 6 foot 3 frame next to me….and under me…but…this will have to do for now. Sam was now blushing. He read on.I’ll miss your kisses, the way you look at me, the way you scrunch your nose when you laugh so big. I’ll miss sleeping beside you, pressed up against your soft skin. Watching your chest rise and fall with every breath while you sleep. Your Eskimo kisses. Holding your hand. Feeling your touch. Your gentle yet strong nature. I’ll miss that sexy voice of yours and how groggy it is in the morning. So if you couldn’t tell by now, I’ll pretty much miss everything about you. I’m thankful that I do have a bunch of meetings with some producers about potential upcoming projects over the next couple weeks, so I’ll have some distractions from thinking about you every minute of the day. I’ll let you know if anything lands! I hope to come and see you soon. Babe, you’re gonna kick ass on this new film. I’m so proud of you. You better send me pics from set. My lips are sealed! Ok go get some sleep. I’ll miss you so much. I already do. I love you. XxLove, Cait. A tear rolled down Sam’s cheek and landed on the letter. He held it up close to his heart. He missed her desperately already. Sam closed his eyes and before he knew it he drifted off to sleep, thinking of nothing but her.
