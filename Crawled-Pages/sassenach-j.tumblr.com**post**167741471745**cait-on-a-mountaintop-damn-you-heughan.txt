The sun was beaming through the curtains which produced a warm glow on their faces and lit up the room. They were in complete bliss.¬†‚ÄúMmmm are ye really here? Or am I dreaming?‚Äù Sam‚Äôs eyes were still closed as he held onto her tight. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre dreaming then so am I. And if so, I never want to wake up.‚Äù Cait snuggled into his neck, kissing him there and breathing him in. Sam lifted her chin, brushing away a few strands of hair covering her face, and softly kissed her forehead. He then moved to the bridge of her nose and then her lips.¬†‚ÄúThis is simply the best way to wake up. I‚Äôve dreamed about this since the day you left. To finally be here in your arms. It‚Äôs everything.‚Äù‚ÄúAnd the day is just getting started,‚Äù Sam whispered in her ear.‚ÄúThe sun feels so good on my face. I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs going to be in the 80‚Äôs here today and it‚Äôs in the 40‚Äôs at home! That‚Äôs it, I‚Äôm never leaving.‚Äù‚ÄúOh don‚Äôt tease me like that, Balfe, because you know I will happily hold you to that!‚Äù Sam‚Äôs chest twitched under her and she knew he was smiling. ‚ÄúHow about we make some omelets for breakfast and then head out to Lion‚Äôs Head?‚Äù‚ÄúI am quite famished,‚Äù Cait said, looking up at Sam with a playful gaze. ‚ÄúOh there‚Äôs always time for that,‚Äù Sam said, biting his lower lip. He took her right then and there. ‚ÄúWell now I‚Äôm really famished,‚Äù Cait giggled as she rolled off of him. ‚ÄúWhat a coincidence, now so am I! For food this time.‚Äù Sam winked and planted a firm kiss on her lips as they got up and headed towards the kitchen.They finished up breakfast and filled their backpack with some snacks, sunscreen and water.They arrived at Lion‚Äôs Head by late morning and began the climb up to the top. It was pretty steep in some parts, so Sam kept a hand on her lower back in case she stumbled.‚ÄúUmm Sam, my back is a bit higher up.‚Äù Cait laughed not minding at all.‚ÄúOh did it slip down to your perfect arse? My apologies,‚Äù Sam said, smiling so hard his nose scrunched.It was so crystal clear out, you could see for miles. The ocean was a magnificent blue with what looked like a turquoise glow along the edge by the shore. ‚ÄúThis is the most beautiful view I‚Äôve ever seen!‚Äù Cait‚Äôs mouth was agape, looking from left to right and spinning herself all the way around in awe, like a kid in a candy store not knowing where to look first. ‚ÄúHave you ever seen anything so beautiful in your entire life?‚Äù‚ÄúAye,‚Äù Sam responded, lost in her, softness in his voice.She gave him a playful shove, a blush emanating from her cheeks. ‚ÄúYou are the most romantic man I‚Äôve ever known.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou make it verra easy,‚Äù Sam said through a smile as he took her hand, bringing it to his mouth and kissing her palm.¬†‚ÄúNow be careful over in this part, it can get a wee bit slick with all the rocks and sand clumped together.‚ÄùJust as he said that, Cait slipped and braced herself with her hands, her knees skimming the rocks.‚Äù‚ÄúOuch! You weren‚Äôt kidding.‚Äù Startled, Sam quickly bent down to help her up. ‚ÄúAre ye all right, love?‚Äù ‚ÄúBarely even felt anything, I have knees of steel,‚Äù she said with a smile albeit a slight grimace.‚ÄúShall we go back?‚Äù Sam looked concerned.‚ÄúI‚Äôm ok, really! Let‚Äôs keep going. I never feel any pain when I‚Äôm with you. But I think I‚Äôll be holding your hand from here on out.‚Äù‚ÄúOh I can happily oblige with that request, milady.‚Äù Sam bowed and held out his hand.‚ÄúI love how dorky you are,‚Äù Cait laughed as she slid her hand into his, their fingers interlocking.¬†They continued to hike up to the highest point, taking in the scenery and a few selfies as well. They stood by the edge of an outstretched rock formation and Sam got behind Cait, wrapping his arms around her, kissing her neck. ‚ÄúWow, this is the most beautiful view with the most beautiful woman. I still can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre here!‚Äù‚ÄúAnd you still have me for another two weeks,‚Äù Cait said as she laid her head back on his chest, turning her face up to gaze at him as Sam pressed his lips against hers.¬†‚ÄúSo besides my clumsy nature, this was a perfect idea. And a perfect day.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe day‚Äôs not over yet,‚Äù Sam said with a wink.¬†They spent some time up at the top, walking around and taking a few moments to relish in the view and in each other. ¬†They took some silly selfies and lots of pics of each other and the scenery. They then sat down for a while, nibbling on some protein bars and water, while resting their legs before the trek down.When they arrived back at Sam‚Äôs place they went out on the balcony and had a glass of wine. The air had gotten slightly cooler and the breeze felt so good against their body after the hike. ‚ÄúI could get used to it here,‚Äù Cait said with a deep sigh. ‚ÄúOn second thought, I could get used to anywhere as long as I‚Äôm with you.‚ÄùSam reached over and gently stroked the back of her neck. Cait‚Äôs hair was still in a ponytail from the hike, and she was glistening. ‚ÄúSam, I‚Äôm all sweaty back there.‚Äù‚ÄúLike I would ever mind? You‚Äôre even sexier when you‚Äôre all sweaty, if that‚Äôs at all possible. He pulled her chair closer to him, and softly kissed the nape of her neck. ‚ÄúMmm salty,‚Äù Sam said as he trailed his tongue up towards her ear.‚Äù‚ÄúThat tickles.‚Äù Cait shuttered as she instinctively brought her shoulder up to her ear.‚ÄúI have an idea,‚Äù Sam said with a wistful look in his eye. ‚ÄúOh yeah? What‚Äôs that?‚Äù‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a surprise,‚Äù he said as he got up and started to walk back into the living room.‚ÄúWait, where are you going?‚Äù Cait furrowed her brow, wondering what he was up to. ‚ÄúGive me five minutes and I‚Äôll come and get you. Stay right there though. No peeking.‚Äù‚ÄúSam Roland Heughan, what are you up to.‚Äù He gave her a look. ‚ÄúOk, ok, I‚Äôll stay put.‚Äù And with a wink, Sam was gone.Five minutes later, as promised, he came back out onto the balcony and got Cait. He put her wine glass down on the table and took her hand, leading her through the living room and down the hall into the bathroom. Cait‚Äôs eyes widened as she saw candles lit, and a bathtub full of water with suds building up along the sides of the tub.‚ÄúYou drew me a bath?‚Äù Cait‚Äôs voice was all high and squeaky. ‚ÄúBabe, I love this so much.‚Äù‚ÄúI thought you could use a nice warm bath to soothe your body after that stumble, and clean off those scraped knees. And selfishly, I want to bathe you.‚Äù Sam put his arms around Cait from behind, squeezing her tight, planting a kiss on the cheek. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs perfect. You‚Äôre perfect. I guess I won‚Äôt be needing any of these sweaty clothes anymore.‚Äù‚ÄúAllow me. It‚Äôs all part of the plan,‚Äù Sam said with a smirk.Sam slowly and methodically helped Cait off with her T-shirt, pulling it up over her head, followed by unclasping her sports bra and sliding it off, as well. He took out her hair tie, and her waves fell amongst her shoulders. Cait slid her bottoms off and turned to face Sam. ‚ÄúAll ready! Bathe away.‚Äù And as she was standing so close to him, she could tell he was ready for something else entirely.‚ÄúIn you go.‚Äù Sam held her hand as she stepped into the warm, soapy water. ¬†She sank down into the tub with a pleasing moan as the water came just below her shoulders, barely covering the tops of her breasts. Sam was kneeling down beside the bathtub. ‚ÄúMmm this feels amazing. You‚Äôre too good to me,‚Äù said Cait, turning towards Sam with her eyes closed as a smile radiated from her face. ¬†Sam moved closer so their foreheads were touching, and instinctively their noses grazed against each other back and forth ever so slightly. ‚ÄúSo how do those knees feel now? They look a little better than earlier.‚Äù Cait had her legs bent so her knees were now above the water. Sam leaned into them and gently kissed each one.¬†‚ÄúAll better now. Your kisses work wonders. They‚Äôre magic. I‚Äôm cured!‚Äù Cait giggled as she caressed his chin, the scruff thankfully still prevalent on his face even after getting it cut for his new film. She loved the feel of his beard, especially as it brushed over her lips and face. He leaned over to kiss her, lingering as he always did on her lips. ‚ÄúOh do they now? Where else might my kisses work wonders?‚Äù A mischievous expression crossed Sam‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúOh I think you know,‚Äù Cait answered back, grabbing his hand and placing it between her legs. Sam caught his breath, letting out a sound from deep within.He began to pour water over her back and shoulders, using a yellow ceramic pitcher he found in the cabinet. He filled back up and continued around to her front, spilling it over her neck and breasts. His other hand was quite occupied at the moment, with Cait squirming beneath his fingers. ‚ÄúTwo questions,‚Äù Cait began, finding her breath‚Ä¶.‚Äùwhy are you wearing all those clothes, and why are you not in here with me?‚Äù‚ÄúAye. Two verra good questions. I like tending to you in this way, being able to see all of you, and how enjoyable you feel right at this moment. But, I do believe there is room in there for me,‚Äù Sam said with a crooked smile.‚ÄúPlenty of room. And if not, I‚Äôll slide back up against you so we conserve more of the space.‚Äù Cait‚Äôs cheeks were beginning to flush at the thought. ‚ÄúWell aren‚Äôt ye the most thoughtful.‚Äù ‚ÄúI aim to please, sir.‚Äù And with that, Cait reached over and lifted his shirt up over his head. ‚ÄúWell this is a good start,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúNow off with those shorts.‚ÄùSam did as he was told, and once completely naked he stepped into the tub behind Cait. ‚ÄúWell now I‚Äôm enjoying this view quite a bit,‚Äù she blushed.Sam slid in behind Cait, his legs outstretched in front of him with Cait leaning back between them. ¬†He grabbed a small towel sitting at arms length on the counter, dipped it in the water and rubbed the bar of soap on it. He brushed Cait‚Äôs hair away from her back and ran the soapy towel over her shoulders and neck, moving down to her back. He then glided his hand along her back, feeling her smooth skin as the soap began to foam on her body. ‚ÄúOh you can do that all night if you‚Äôd like. It‚Äôs ok if our skin becomes like a prune. You sitting behind me, thighs squeezing onto me and rubbing your hands against my skin? Yes, keep going please.‚Äù‚ÄúAs you wish.‚Äù Leaving the towel hanging over the tub, Sam‚Äôs hands then traveled around to her front, massaging her breasts, then sliding up to her neck and back down; the soap making everything more slick. He cupped her breasts again, squeezing gently and circling his finger around her nipples.¬†Cait‚Äôs hands were under the water massaging his thighs, feeling him quite aroused behind her. Grabbing the soap from Sam, she lathered up her hands and reached back, caressing his face, neck and shoulders. His hands were still all over her body, now traveling down to her thighs, grabbing hold with a fierce need, while pushing himself against her. ‚ÄúHave I thoroughly bathed you to yer liking?‚Äù Cait reached behind her back, grabbing for him. ‚ÄúOh that you did. You tended to me quite well. Allow me to return the favor,‚Äù she said as she slid her hand up and down his shaft, Sam biting into her shoulder with every stroke.Cait lifted herself up, knowing it wouldn‚Äôt be so easy in the water, and attempted to slide onto him. ‚ÄúOk, this isn‚Äôt as easy as I was hoping,‚Äù Cait groaned as she just couldn‚Äôt manage to slide down. Damn water makes it difficult.‚Äù‚ÄúHmm how about if we try something new, with the hopes we don‚Äôt go toppling off the tub.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm game,‚Äù Cait said with a quizzical look on her face. ‚ÄúThe water is umm, quite drying, which is quite the oxymoron, but in this case it‚Äôs true. How about if I sit on the ledge of the tub, legs dangling in the water for support, and you sit on me the same way. I won‚Äôt let ye fall.‚Äù‚ÄúI will try anything with you which results in you inside of me.‚Äù Sam stood up and sat on the ledge, grabbing the soap and lathering up his hands which he then covered on his member.‚ÄúOh I like this idea,‚Äù Cait said as she stood up, back to Sam, and slowly sat down right on him. They both let out a moan as Cait flexed her hips up and down while Sam held onto her, arching his pelvis simultaneously. Cait grabbed at his thigh with one hand and pushed her other hand against the wall. She was panting, her legs tiring, but she completely ignored the strain. ‚ÄúYou come up with the best ideas,‚Äù she said as Sam‚Äôs hand traveled to her front, his fingers teasing her. It didn‚Äôt take long for both to find their release. Cait collapsed down on Sam, her full body weight on top of him.While in bed, in their post sex glow, Sam reached into his nightstand drawer and pulled something out, keeping it tucked in his hand.‚ÄúI have another surprise for you,‚Äù he said with an almost shy demeanor. ‚ÄúAnother surprise? You‚Äôre spoiling me, Sam.‚Äù‚ÄúOh I hope so.‚ÄùCait saw his hand clasped around something and propped herself up on her elbow, grinning from ear to ear in anticipation. Sam scooted himself up on the bed so he was sitting a bit more upright.‚ÄúI got something for you soon after I arrived here in South Africa. Not to sound too cheesy, but,‚Äù Sam continued as he opened his hand. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a promise ring. No matter how far apart we are, it‚Äôs always going to be you.‚ÄùCait‚Äôs face was one of pure surprise and awe and happiness all in one. The ring was stainless steel with hearts etched into the band going all the way around. ‚ÄúOh my gosh. Sam, it‚Äôs so beautiful. I love it so much. I love YOU so much.‚Äù She sat straight up, grabbing his face with both hands, kissing him hard on the mouth.‚ÄúI love you more,‚Äù he said as he slipped it on her right ring finger. ‚ÄúI know the distance is difficult, but whenever you‚Äôre feeling lonely or if you ever doubt how much I love you, just look down and you‚Äôll know.‚Äù‚ÄúI‚Äôll never take it off,‚Äù Cait said as she twirled it around her finger, amazed at this man in front of her.¬†Sam brushed her cheek with the back of his fingertips, stopping at her mouth, gently pulling her bottom lip down with his finger. His mouth closed in on hers and they sunk back down into the bed, completely lost in each other, both knowing that this, what they have together, is forever.¬†

The treetops lining the streets were covered in white powdery snow, and there were colorful holiday lights draped around lampposts, tree trunks and door frames of apartment buildings. Manhattan is such a magical place in winter. As Caitriona walked around Central Park, bundled up in her puffy ski jacket with scarf and hat, she wished Sam was walking next to her, holding her hand. Central Park will always be their place. That‚Äôs truly where she fell head over heels for this man who sat on the other end of that bench.It had only been 2 weeks since Sam left, yet for Cait it easily felt like 2 months, if not longer. She missed his smile, his touch, how he made her laugh so hard without even trying. They spoke and texted as much as they could, but the time difference was becoming increasingly difficult, especially with his busy filming schedule. Cait had kept busy with auditions and meetings, but the nights were the hardest.Lost in thought, Cait felt her phone vibrate in her pocket and reached in to pull it out. Her face lit up as she fumbled off her gloves to answer the call.‚ÄúSam!‚Äù‚ÄúHi beautiful.‚Äù Sam‚Äôs voice was soft and she could tell he was smiling as he spoke.‚ÄúOh babe, it‚Äôs so great to hear your voice. I miss you so much.‚Äù Cait was grinning from ear to ear. Just the sound of his voice made everything better.‚ÄúI miss you more.‚Äù‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs possible,‚Äù Cait said as she found their bench and sat down.‚ÄúGuess where I am right now?‚Äù‚ÄúNaked in bed?‚Äù Sam said with utter delight.‚ÄúHaha no. But I like where your mind is. Alas, it‚Äôs only 2pm here. And being in bed isn‚Äôt quite the same anymore without your body next to mine.‚Äù Cait sighed audibly.‚ÄúWhat I wouldn‚Äôt give to wrap my arms around that body of yours right now.‚Äù‚ÄúIt kinda feels like you are at this moment. I‚Äôm sitting on our bench, where we met. Where, you know, you fell hopelessly in love with me at first sight.‚Äù Cait giggled.‚ÄúMmmm I miss that giggle. And did I now? I believe it was you who couldn‚Äôt keep yer eyes off of me, Balfe.‚Äù‚ÄúI wish you were here with me right now and I‚Äôd show you how much I couldn‚Äôt keep my‚Ä¶.hands off of you.‚Äù‚ÄúOh Cait, I wish that more than anything too,‚Äù Sam said as he let out a deep guttural groan.‚ÄúSo tell me, how‚Äôs filming going? How‚Äôs South Africa?‚Äù‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been great so far! Long days but it‚Äôs such a fun experience. And South Africa is heaven. It‚Äôs so incredibly beautiful. Speaking of beautiful, when am I seeing your face?‚Äù‚ÄúI thought you‚Äôd never ask.‚Äù A wave of happiness flushed through her body at the thought of seeing him. She felt a warmth permeating through.‚ÄúIf I had my way I‚Äôd have ye here with me every day. And night. I go to bed thinking about you and wake up the same.‚Äù‚ÄúIs 2 weeks from now soon enough?‚Äù As cold as it was on that park bench, Cait didn‚Äôt even notice. Seeing him and being with him again was all she could think about.‚ÄúNope. Not soon enough at all. But I‚Äôll take it!‚Äù Sam could barely contain his excitement. It‚Äôll be a month since they last saw each other, in the flesh, and it was a month too long.‚ÄúI‚Äôll be counting the days. I can‚Äôt wait to see you. I love you.‚Äù‚ÄúI love you more.‚Äù Sam kissed the phone and hung up.Two weeks surprisingly flew by. Cait boarded her flight and knew she should sleep but was too excited at the thought of seeing him in a handful of hours. She was finally going to be back in his arms, exactly where she belongs. This last month without him was torture.The plane touched down and she pulled out her phone and texted Sam.Guess who‚Äôs in South Africa?!Guess who‚Äôs waiting at baggage claim?!Cait could barely stand it. She couldn‚Äôt get to him fast enough. She felt like the plane was taxiing forever. It finally pulled up to the gate and the doors opened. She was sitting quite forward in the plane for this very reason‚Ä¶so she could get to him as quickly as possible. Cait was wearing black baggy pants that tapered at the ankle, grey suede booties, a white tee shirt and her black leather jacket. She hurried down the hallway and onto the escalator. She continued to follow the signs to baggage claim, and there he was. Looking as handsome as ever with the biggest smile on his face, and holding a sign that simply said ‚ÄòMo Chridhe.‚Äô ‚ÄúMy heart,‚Äù she mouthed, clutching hers.Like right out of a movie, they sprinted towards each other, Cait leaping into his arms, legs wrapping around him. Sam spun her around, kissing her hard on the lips. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre finally here!‚Äù Sam was out of breath and smiling so hard. She dropped her legs to the floor and stood there holding him, eyes filling with tears. ‚ÄúLook at you with this dark, short hair,‚Äù she said as she ran her fingers through his curls, which were still making an appearance. ‚ÄúI love it. So handsome.‚Äù She softly kissed his lips, their foreheads now touching. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs grab your luggage and get outta here, shall we?‚ÄùWhile waiting for the luggage to drop, Sam and Cait couldn‚Äôt keep their eyes off each other. She was leaning into him as both arms were around her, holding tight. His face was buried in her hair, breathing her in. Cait‚Äôs luggage came out right away and off they went.They got back to Sam‚Äôs place in just under an hour. They talked and talked in the car, fingers interlocked the entire time, catching up and stealing kisses at the red lights. They finally arrived at his place and he grabbed her suitcase out of the trunk and wheeled it up the path to his apartment building. He was on the top floor, with a beautiful balcony view overlooking the marina with sailboat after sailboat all in a line. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs absolutely beautiful here, Sam.‚Äù‚ÄúJust wait until you see the view from the balcony.‚ÄùHe unlocked the door and held it open as Cait walked thru first. Placing her suitcase just inside the door, Sam grabbed her from behind, his arms enveloping her, traveling up and down her body with a fiery passion. He couldn‚Äôt wait any longer. Closing the door behind him, Cait whipped around and pushed him up against the door, their lips and tongues finding each other in a matter of seconds. Sam grabbed hold of Cait‚Äôs thighs and lifted her up, her legs locking around his waist.‚ÄúI‚Äôll give ye the tour later, Mo Nighean donn,‚Äù he mutters breathlessly into her ear. ‚ÄúOh, right now the bedroom is the only room in this place I wanna see,‚Äù she whispers back.He carries her down the hallway into his bedroom, not breaking stride, nor lip contact. Panting and pulling at each other‚Äôs clothes, they both topple into the bed. Sam rolls her over and gets on top, moving her hair out of her face, sweeping it behind her ear. He looks at her as if it‚Äôs the very first time and he can‚Äôt believe this perfect woman is his. He slowly and methodically unbuttons her blouse, not taking his eyes off her, exposing her black lace bra. He presses his mouth against her breasts, moaning with each kiss. Cait begins to stir under him, her pelvis reacting to his touch.‚ÄúOh God, I want you so badly,‚Äù Sam utters with barely a breath to be had. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve thought of nothing but this since the first night we were apart. Do ye want me?‚Äù Without a word, Cait grabs his shoulders and pushes him over, rolling on top of him, pinning him to the bed. She grabs hold of his member, which is throbbing with want and anticipation, and guides it under her. Sam‚Äôs hips shift in upwards, entering her quickly as he grabs her buttocks and pushes himself deeper inside. Cait‚Äôs moans become louder and louder. He has perfect view of her breasts as he continues to fondle them, reaching back to unhook her bra as it falls on top of him. He sits up, taking her nipple into his mouth, his tongue flicking away. Uncontrollably, Cait reaches into his hair as she pulls his face closer, Sam now moving to her other breast. Arching her back at the sensation, she continues to gyrate on top of him, both of them moaning with pleasure.‚ÄúWhat was your question again? Do I want you? Have I sufficiently answered that?‚Äù Out of breath and beads of sweat forming on her brow, Cait smiles as she continues to flex her pelvis up and down.‚ÄúOh aye, you have answered that verra well indeed.‚ÄùThey spent the next two hours in bed, two becoming one, buried in each other‚Äôs arms making up for lost time. Sam had a full week and a half off from filming due to the holiday and he was going to spend every single minute of that with Cait.‚ÄúSo are ye tired or do you want to go exploring today? I want to take you to the most beautiful spot here in Cape Town. It‚Äôs called Lion‚Äôs Head. We‚Äôll go for a wee hike! Ok, so it‚Äôs not quite wee, but it‚Äôs so beautiful.‚Äù‚ÄúI‚Äôll go anywhere with you,‚Äù Cait said as she smiled against his lips.

                                                                ch 1 / ch 2 / ch 3 / ch 4 / ch 5 / ch 6Chapter 7 - Don‚Äôt forget about meThe sky was ominous, with thick dark clouds forming above. The wind was beginning to whip. The air was thick. A storm was approaching at full speed. It mirrored exactly what Sam and Cait were feeling inside, knowing that when they woke, it would be the day they‚Äôve been dreading from the moment they met. ¬†It was 7am and Sam and Caitriona were together, arms and legs enveloping one another in bed, sleeping soundly, at peace. From the looks of them you‚Äôd think they had at least another 3 months together in each other‚Äôs arms. The window was slightly ajar and a whistle was emanating through the screen, as the wind was becoming even more fierce. The rain was beginning to pour down. Sam woke up first. Eyes flickering, moving back and forth under his eyelids. Her beautiful face was right in front of him when he finally opened his eyes. A smile formed across his lips. She was the love of his life. He exhaled heavily and wisps of her hair slightly moved over her face. He gently swept them away and caressed her cheek, not wanting to wake her just yet. ‚ÄúI wish we could stay in this moment forever,‚Äù he whispered, mouth squished into the pillow, eyes still locked on her. Caitriona stirred, but was still sound asleep. Sam‚Äôs arms were still around her, and he gave her a light squeeze. His eyes shifted to the window as he got lost in the sound of the rain hitting the window almost like a tapping sound, as the tree branches rattled around. The storm was due to pass by late afternoon, well before his 9pm flight. ‚ÄúHow long have you been awake?‚Äù said a raspy voiced Cait, catching Sam off guard. ‚ÄúGood morning, beautiful,‚Äù he said with a smile as he leaned over to her lips. ‚ÄúNot long. I was enjoying watching you sleep so peacefully.‚Äù‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt drooling or anything, was I?‚Äù She brought a hand up to her mouth just in case.‚ÄúHa. No, not at all. And I‚Äôd still find that sexy, even if ye had been.‚Äù‚ÄúLiar.‚Äù Cait giggled and tightened her grip around him as he kissed her on the nose. He pulled her closer and they lay there listening to the storm brewing outside.‚ÄúYou know, this is the perfect day to stay in bed,‚Äù Cait said as she lifted her face up to his and tucked a stray curl behind his ear.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs as if ye read my mind,‚Äù Sam happily replied as he pulled the covers up over them both. Their legs were still intertwined and Cait began to rub his back with her free hand, as the other one was tucked against his chest. Sam reciprocated with the same. No words were spoken as they let their hands and bodies do the talking. They began to kiss passionately, their tongues moving about together in a rhythm almost like a dance. In one swift move Cait rolled on top of him, pinning his shoulders down. ‚ÄúMmm so this is what ye had in mind, aye?‚Äù An amused expression crossed Sam‚Äôs face.‚ÄúAmong other things,‚Äù Cait said in a playful tone. ¬†She began to run her fingers gently up and down his chest, stopping briefly to circle ¬†around his abs. ‚ÄúYou feel so good,‚Äù Cait breathlessly uttered as continued to trace down towards his member, slowly moving her hand up and down in a teasing manner.Sam‚Äôs hands were in turn all over Cait, running up and down her back, moving to her front.‚ÄúAye, you feel good too.‚Äù Sam moaned with pleasure as his fingers were now inside her, in and out, teasing her right back. Cait‚Äôs body began to tremble with pleasure, as she gyrated on top of him. She held herself up, putting her hand on his stomach as she arched her back. With her other hand she grabbed for him, and guiding him towards her, lifted her hips and slowly sat down, letting out a guttural cry as she did so. He slid deep inside, filling her whole. Sam‚Äôs eyes closed immediately and his face was one of complete euphoria as he reached for her hips, his pelvis rising and falling with every stroke. ¬†Neither of them wanted to finish too quickly, but instead just be with each other, feeling every bit of the other in this way for as long as they could.Afterwards, they fell back asleep, Cait in the nook and Sam‚Äôs arms fully encircling her. When they woke up again a couple hours later, the rain was beginning to taper off and the sun was starting to peak through the clouds. Rays of light were hitting the window and the white curtains began to look iridescent as the room got brighter. Sam squinted from the rays pushing through the curtains as he slowly opened his eyes. ‚ÄúOch, I guess we‚Äôd better get a shower and have some breakfast.‚Äù ‚ÄúMmmmm I suppose we should,‚Äù Caitriona grumbled. ‚ÄúI am getting quite hungry after our morning workout,‚Äù she winked as she burrowed her head into his neck.‚ÄúAnd tis my favorite morning workout to do with you. Heck, morning, afternoon, evening, nighttime‚Ä¶take your pick.‚Äù Sam kissed her forehead and playfully patted her on the bottom. ‚ÄúAll of the above, thank you very much. Why choose just one.‚Äù Caitriona lifted her head and pressed her lips against his.They spent the entire day together, not talking much about the inevitable, but instead living in the moment and enjoying each other. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ummm‚Ä¶do you need help packing? What time do we have to leave for the airport?‚Äù Cait‚Äôs eyes sloped downward and her shoulders began to sag.Sam lifted up Caitriona‚Äôs chin and his lips covered hers. ‚ÄúI pretty much got all my packing done the night you were filming. I only have a few items left to squeeze into the suitcase. Let‚Äôs see, it‚Äôs only 4pm, so I‚Äôd say we should probably leave in a couple hours.‚ÄùCait helped him pack up the last bit and piled everything by the door. The rain had now dissipated and the sky turned blue. It felt like a completely different day than the one they woke up to. Sam walked over to the sound system and put on some music. ‚ÄúMay I have this dance?‚Äù‚ÄúYou are truly the sweetest, most romantic man I‚Äôve ever met.‚Äù Cait took his hand and he guided her into his chest. She put her head against him and they swayed slowly to the music. She could hear his heart beating as she closed her eyes and lost herself in him. Sam‚Äôs arms were wrapped tightly around her. ¬†‚Ä¶‚Ä¶They arrived at the airport and walked over to the waiting group of chairs right before the escalator would take Sam up to security. This is where they would part.They both let out a deep sigh and smiled, but not with their eyes. Sam tucked a piece of her hair behind her ear, sliding his fingers into her hair, landing on the back of her neck.He pulled her close and wrapped his arms around her, not wanting to let go. Ever. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget about me,‚Äù Sam said with a hitch in his voice. He wasn‚Äôt very serious but yet there was a sadness and honesty in his voice. He knew they would stay in touch every day via text and FaceTime whenever possible. But it wasn‚Äôt nearly the same as actually feeling her and seeing this beautiful woman right in front of him whenever he wanted. Cait grabbed hold of him even tighter, trying to fight back the tears‚Ä¶.‚ÄúAs if I could even if I tried. Which I would never ever do. You have my heart. And I know you‚Äôll always keep it safe. As I will with yours. You‚Äôre never gonna be far away from me.‚ÄùThey pulled back, arms still in place, locked behind each other‚Äôs back. They were now face to face. Both had watery eyes, and a single tear rolled down Cait‚Äôs cheek. Sam leaned in and kissed the tear away, then moved over to her lips.‚ÄúWell now you‚Äôre all salty,‚Äù she giggled through tears. Sam smiled, licking his lips. ‚ÄúAye, and it‚Äôs verra good salt.‚Äù‚ÄúYou dork,‚Äù Cait quipped. ‚ÄúA dork who loves you,‚Äù Sam said with such a tenderness in his voice.Simultaneously they‚Äôre hands slid down from each other‚Äôs back and they clasped, interlocking fingers and squeezing tight. Sam brought her hand up to his mouth and just held it there, lips pressed down, breathing her in. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll text me right when you land, right? Even if I‚Äôm sleeping, please do or I‚Äôll worry. Although I don‚Äôt know how much sleep I‚Äôll get without you beside me.‚Äù ‚ÄúI promise. I miss you already.‚Äù Sam reached his hand up and palmed her cheek, gently rubbing her lips with his thumb. She kissed his finger as he paused on her lips. ‚ÄúKiss me, Cait. But not a last kiss by any stretch. Just until the next.‚Äù ¬†She sunk into him and wrapped her arms around his neck. They kissed like no one was watching, even though they were in an airport filled with people. Neither of them cared. They finally parted, foreheads pressed against each other. ¬†‚ÄúI guess you‚Äôd better go,‚Äù Cait said, voice shaking.Sam held onto her hand as he slowly walked away. Fingertips touching until the last moment.Sam smiled as he got on the escalator. ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù he mouthed as he then disappeared from sight.Sam got settled in his seat as the plane doors were about to close. He stared out the window, reliving those last moments with Cait. ¬†Before he knew it the plane was taking off and he would be in Scotland in the morning.He reached into his bag for his headphones. As he was rummaging through he heard a crinkling sound and pulled out an envelope.His name was written on the front with a heart surrounding it. ‚ÄúA letter from Cait,‚Äù he said to himself, face lighting up. She must have slipped it into his bag while he wasn‚Äôt looking.Sam took a deep breath and opened the envelope. They were now above the clouds, climbing to 35,000 feet. Dear Sam,Right now you‚Äôre probably thinking, when did she sneak this letter into my bag? Let alone when did she write it? Seeing as how you and I have pretty much been together for 3 straight months almost every single day, but you know me‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sneaky when I want to be! And I love surprising you as much as you love surprising me. ¬†It‚Äôs also possible I snuck a few pics of you on my cell while you were sleeping the other night. Don‚Äôt give me that look, Heughan. Now when I go to sleep I can look at you and it‚Äôll be like we‚Äôre together. ¬†Of course I‚Äôd much prefer that sexy 6 foot 3 frame next to me‚Ä¶.and under me‚Ä¶but‚Ä¶this will have to do for now. Sam was now blushing. He read on.I‚Äôll miss your kisses, the way you look at me, the way you scrunch your nose when you laugh so big. I‚Äôll miss sleeping beside you, pressed up against your soft skin. Watching your chest rise and fall with every breath while you sleep. Your Eskimo kisses. Holding your hand. Feeling your touch. Your gentle yet strong nature. I‚Äôll miss that sexy voice of yours and how groggy it is in the morning. So if you couldn‚Äôt tell by now, I‚Äôll pretty much miss everything about you. I‚Äôm thankful that I do have a bunch of meetings with some producers about potential upcoming projects over the next couple weeks, so I‚Äôll have some distractions from thinking about you every minute of the day. I‚Äôll let you know if anything lands! I hope to come and see you soon. Babe, you‚Äôre gonna kick ass on this new film. I‚Äôm so proud of you. You better send me pics from set. My lips are sealed! Ok go get some sleep. I‚Äôll miss you so much. I already do. I love you. XxLove, Cait. A tear rolled down Sam‚Äôs cheek and landed on the letter. He held it up close to his heart. He missed her desperately already. Sam closed his eyes and before he knew it he drifted off to sleep, thinking of nothing but her.
