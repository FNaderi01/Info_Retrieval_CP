    Summary
      She had always been told stories of Dragons, of their Loyalty, Bravery, and Valour. Specifically, the ones about the Dragon Spirit; Draco, and his stars; the Draconis. They always had fascinated her, because they got up, no matter what, and because they protected what was theirs, like a true dragon. And she had wanted that, so desperately. Wanted that feeling of safety. Now that she had it, people were trying to take it away from her. Take them, away from her. And there was no way she was just going to roll over and let it happen. Like the old proverb said, "Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned." Her name is Lucy Heartfilia, and she was going to protect what's hers.

    Summary
      Hayley was never normal to begin with. A mumble here, an action there. Little things, that were passed off as just quirks. So when she fell into that crevice full of 'Moon's Blood', everything was just accentuated. A snarl every so often, sensing where we were (making a surprise attack useless) and smelling things from so far way it just couldn't be possible, but that was just Hayley, and we loved her for it.

    Summary
      "So why should I be the one to go?! You’re the teacher! The Hero!! What good could someone like me do?!”“Izuku.” The man’s voice was harsh, and made the younger man’s eyes focus on his friend. His eyes softened. “It must be you. You’re not who you were back then. You aren’t useless. Remember this: You are a Hero. And the world is counting on you—even if nobody realizes it. Here. When the time comes... give this to him. You'll know he trusts you when he calls you 'Problem Child.'" He smiled fondly, handing Izuku a pair of rings on a chain.~~~~~~~When the world ends, their only hope is to send one Quirkless man back in time. Back in his 14-year-old body, will Midoriya Izuku be able to save the world that shunned him all his life? And will he finally be able to become a hero this go around?Good thing he had time as a vigilante to practice.

    Summary
      Thirteen is too young to gain eight years of memories that might come to pass--especially when you don't even know what to do with yourself in the present. But when the future is that bloody and dark, do you have any choice but to try to change it?  He remembers the absolute agony of the doctors trying to save him, which finally sent him into blissful unconsciousness—  —except he doesn’t remember any of that. Tsuna’s last memory is of putting his head down on his desk and falling asleep to the sound of the teacher’s droning, thirteen years old and tired of not understanding a word, not of being twenty-two and beloved and dying.
