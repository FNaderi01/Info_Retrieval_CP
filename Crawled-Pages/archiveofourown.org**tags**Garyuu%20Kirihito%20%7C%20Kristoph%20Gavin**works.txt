    Summary
      Kristoph Gavin's prison psychiatrist has seen just about everything. When the disgraced lawyer becomes one of his clients, however, he starts seeing his workplace, his life, and his place in the world a whole lot differently as Gavin's influence on events and other people widens. Big warnings here for mentions of institutional abuse, and, well, all the terrible prison tropes including violence, verbal abuse, indifference, and generalised bastardry.

    Summary
      Apollo, an orphaned empath and magical law apprentice, finds himself lost after his mentor is locked up for poisoning people he supposedly never met. While working alongside Trucy, the daughter of one of the victims, he writes to Kristoph's estranged younger brother, asking for his help in solving the case. When Klavier, a talented spellsinger whose music is only surpassed by his magic, arrives at his request, he is nothing like Apollo imagined. And yet, he may be exactly who he was looking for.

    Summary
      The thing people noticed most often about Phoenix Wright wasn’t his hair, or the scar on his lip, or his dorky smile. They didn’t notice his suit, or his shiny sunflower defense badge, or the nervous tics he makes with his hands.No.They noticed his eyes.

    Summary
      This story delves into the mystery of where the HELL Maya Fey and Miles Edgeworth were when Phoenix Wright's world collapsed around him post disbarment and WHY they weren't at his side during Phoenix's darkest hour for those long seven years. Join Phoenix, Maya, Miles, Franziska and the rest of your favourite Ace Attorney characters for nearly a decade and experience with them both their laughter and tears, as they discover life's bittersweet truths: sometimes love isn't enough to mean happily ever after, all the money in the world can't necessarily fix all tragedies, justice doesn't always prevail, and broken hearts heal...but can they ever truly mend? Follows the Ace Attorney Timeline for the most part and goes through AJ to Post DD. Slight spoilers for all games. This is the final installment of the Turnabout Lawful Love Trilogy and takes place right where Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman ended. The story starts pre-Apollo Justice, right before Phoenix's disbarment. Official part 3 of the Turnabout Lawful Love Trilogy.

    Summary
      State of California v. Wright, round three.This time, without any complications or legal miracles. There was one key difference — this time, Phoenix knew that he was guilty. Much to Phoenix's dismay, the State of California happens to be full of people who love him.

    Summary
      "This better be important." He nearly yelled into the phone... He listened closely though, intensely. Taking in every word, letting it wash over him. He's never heard him sound like that."Wright, what are you saying?"------or my take/headcanons on moments during the 7 year gap, from edgeworth's perspective.

    Summary
      Miles came back from Europe seven years ago after realizing he couldn’t stay away from Phoenix, but found Phoenix had disappeared without a trace after losing his badge. Now seven years later Phoenix comes back as a murder suspect, and as the current Chief Prosecutor, Miles has no alternative but to be involved with his return, even though it opens all the wounds he had worked so hard to close over those years.  But he will find that Phoenix himself has been severely damaged by the things he had to go through mostly alone, and that if they’re able to trust each other again, they can work towards healing together.(or, a GS4 retelling with Miles in it.)

    Summary
      Apollo had a hard time paying off his studies almost by himself, college is very expensive for the less fortunate. A friend recommends him a place to work part-time to help his economy, but he didn't expect the kind of job he would have! He then meets his future mentor, and his future lover, probably. Pre-Apollo Justice and tangles with the story.
