    Summary
      Still blindly following Clave orders, Alec infuriates Magnus and gets kicked out of the loft.  Magnus nurses his emotional wounds and Dot shows up. Lots of vodka, emotional upheaval, and recently compromised state with Azazael lead the doorway open for an unwelcome visit from one of Magnus's many uncles, A Prince of Hell, Greater Demon Samael -- with a personal agenda against Magnus and everything he holds dear.  Alec unwittingly gets caught in the middle. This doesn't bode well for either of them in the (tumultous) aftermath.Canon divergent season 2 episode 13CHAPTER 20 UPDATED

    Summary
      “They used to hunt us for sport, you know.”
It’s the last thing Alec expects to hear in the protracted silence after their lovemaking. He can still feel the echoes of Magnus’ lips on his skin, although the hum of satisfaction has faded from his body.
  (Or, Magnus regales Alec with an ugly tidbit from his past after their fight about the strand of Magnus' hair.)

    Summary
      “You never have to prove yourself to me.”Magnus frowns. “I never for one second thought that you seriously suspected me of a brutal, pointless murder.”Alec shifts uneasily on his feet, clearly thrown off balance. He stares for a moment, seemingly not reaching any conclusion. “Then why were you so angry?”
