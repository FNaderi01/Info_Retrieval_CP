EdNext Podcast · Ep. 139 – Nov. 7, 2018: Lessons from an Effort to Reform Teacher Evaluation
			For four years, Tom Kane ran a project for the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation which offered to help a set of school districts develop new ways of evaluating teacher effectiveness. He talks with EdNext’s Marty West about lessons to be learned from that effort.
Kane, the Walter H. Gale Professor of Education and Economics at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, is the author of “Develop and Validate — Then Scale: Lessons from the Gates Foundation’s Effective Teaching Strategy.”
The EdNext Podcast is available on Apple Podcasts, Google Play, Soundcloud, Stitcher and here every Wednesday.
