    Summary
      Hitoshi isn’t sure how he feels about moving. But he hopes that maybe, just maybe, people won’t talk about how he has a “villain’s” quirk. At the very least, it seems like he’s making friends with the odd kid who lives right next door to him now.(Or, AU where the Shinsous move next door to the Midoriyas)

    Summary
      It comes with the package deal of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Midoriya gets another chance at life, but he must throw it away when that dreaded day comes. After all, a life for nineteen is more than a fair trade. 
Or: the world will rise or fall, and it depends on one boy protecting Class 1-A to prevent the inevitable.

    Summary
      Izuku Midoriya is going to be a hero, and where can he learn that better than U.A.? Sure it'll be challenging, but he has the full support of his rather... unusual family, and he'll be attending alongside his closest friends!And besides, All For One retired years ago and has made it quite clear he will not be returning to his life of crime so long as Izuku keeps him supplied with hugs. With the most dangerous villain ever officially dead, what's the worst that can happen?
