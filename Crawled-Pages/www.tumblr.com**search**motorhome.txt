5GMC MotorHome, 1974. A purpose-built motorhome based on the front wheel drivetrain adapted from an Oldsmobile Toronado, allowing an unusually low profile with the floor having only 14 inches clearance above the roadway. Available in 23 and 26ft lengths and a variety of layouts, around 90% of production was based on the 26ft version. The interior fittings were made by the Gemini Corporation in Mt. Clemens, Michigan. In production for 5 years between 1973 and 1978, 12,921 were made. After production ended it was never replaced. It is estimated that 8,000 to 9,000 of the original production are still in running order with over 7,000 currently listed in the international registry.

6Volkswagen California XXL, 2017. VW have revealed full details and more pics of their concept campervan. Anyway over to the press release:The aim of the California XXL’s development team was to make optimum use of space and achieve ideal partitioning on board the new camper. They succeeded in this, as innovative individual solutions enabled them to create a pioneering, flexible package, including the pull-out wet room with shower and WC and the rear bed, which can be folded away in sections in a matter of seconds in order to either significantly increase the size of the kitchen or to create a cosy seating corner. Viewed from above, the motorhome can be divided into six areas, which, depending on usage, merge into each other:Living and dining areaKitchen with sink, gas hob and fridgesWet room with shower, sink and WCSpacious sleeping area at the rearAlcoves for two childrenIntegrated cab
