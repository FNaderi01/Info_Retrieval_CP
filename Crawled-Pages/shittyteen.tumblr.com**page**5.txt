        anarcblr:pretentiouslimericks:Image transcript:‚ÄúBut what will you do with the lazy man, the man who does not want to work?‚Äù inquires your friend.That is an interesting question, and you will probably be very much surprised when I say that there is really no such thing as laziness. What we call a lazy man is generally a square man in a round hole. That is, the right man in the wrong place, And you will always find that when a fellow is in the wrong place, he will be inefficient or shiftless. For so-called laziness and a good deal of inefficiency are merely unfitness, misplacement. If you are compelled to do the thing you are unfitted for by your inclinations or temperament, you will be inefficient at it; if you are forced to do work you are not interested in, you will be lazy at it.anarchist-housewife:Think about this quote like all the time and how it really undermines so much shit in capitalismEnd transcript‚ÄìAlexander Berkman, ‚ÄúWhat is Communist Anarchism?: Will Communist Anarchism Work?‚Äù (1929)
