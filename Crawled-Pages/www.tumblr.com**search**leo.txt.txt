god i go feral whenever i even THINK about the raven cycle. the symbolism, the homoerotic religious imagry, “adam lived in an apartment located above the office of st. agnes catholic church, a fortuitous combination that focused most of the objects of ronan’s worship into one downtown block,” the found family, the foreshadowing, it’s starting, it’s starting, the absolute poetry of it all… ugh. every line in that series was raw as fuck

what i love about ace attorney is how natural the character development can be, because the games are played out over such a long in-game time period. in a normal story the character development happens because someone has an epiphany and is forced to change, but in ace attorney the development can happen because you’re just getting older! maya’s not a kid anymore! phoenix isn’t the optimistic, naive art student, miles softens over time because sometimes we do that as we grow older. they’re all adjusting to the real world from who they used to be and they’re growing!! babe that’s real, actual, growth, and growth doesn’t always happen through epiphanies, sometimes it happens through facing the hard truth and sometimes it happens from letting people love you.

so do you ever think about how korra’s parents let her go to the republic city all alone when she was just 17 and the next time they saw her she lost her bending and was pretty much ready to commit suicide? do you ever think about how they must have felt, seeing their daughter lose connection to the avatar spirit, something that has always been so closely tied to korra’s identity, because of their close family relative? do you think about tonraq and senna seeing their child poisoned and with broken legs, trying to learn how to walk and dealing with ptsd? how all that happened in a span of 3 years and it took korra another 3 to even just leave southern water tribe? do you ever think about tonraq and senna remembering how happy they were when they found out korra is the avatar and then realizing how much pain it has caused her?

ok but. ignoring that they are an owl and a racoon, younger tom nook and blathers are like….. meet cute DREAM. like a young guy who just got disowned by his rich-ass family and is moving to the city to find himself and maybe become a small-business owner and also adopt two “nephews” meets the scholar with a fear of bugs and blathers spills his coffee on tom’s last clean shirt (because this man does NOT know how to do laundry) and tom laughs it off and compliments his bowtie. of course they have a whirl-wind romance, and of course blathers calls it off when he has to accept a new post at a new museum because he wants to put his career and the nobel pursuit of knowledge first, and maybe he’s a little frustrated with nook’s willingness to give loans to any old kid he sees, and maybe tom doesn’t understand blather’s sleeping habits. but OF COURSE they meet again when they are both older and wiser, at a little town out in the wide, wide world. blathers has his doctorate now, and tom has two little children to help him in his ventures and the two of them decide to follow each other everywhere, because any new town needs a museum.
