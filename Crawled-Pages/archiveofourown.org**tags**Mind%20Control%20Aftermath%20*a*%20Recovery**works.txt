    Summary
      Shuri has freed Bucky from the triggers, but Bucky still has to recover and to deal with the guilt. How does Bucky learn to open up again as a human being? Can he trust himself after all that has happened? This is also my answer as to why Shuri would have Bucky recover in a Wakandan village and not a city.

    Summary
      Hawk Moth makes another poor akumatization decision, giving a supervillain the power to force others to make babies. He doesn’t expect it to affect himself or his son—but it does.Things between Marinette and Adrien get incredibly awkward after The Incident, but at least they’re not alone. Half their class is in the same boat.And just when everyone starts to be able to move on from that, they discover the ‘baby-making’ thing wasn’t just a euphemism. Babies are on the way. No one’s ready for it, but it’s happening, and they’re all gonna do their best to deal with it.Will this be the thing that finally gets Adrien to fall in love with Marinette? Or will Cat Noir’s insistence that he loves Ladybug and doesn’t care if she’s having some other guy’s baby be enough to win her over?

To make matters worse, the President and three other members of the Literature Club Rosa is (apparently) involved in keeps acting weird around her brother MC, Bill witnesses a classmate being stalked, Dave finds out that the school has a dark secret, and all three of them keep seeing ghosts.What is a newly formed soulmate triad to do?

    Summary
      No one asked about the eye.It wasn't something Peter Nureyev even noticed that he'd noticed, just another unnecessary piece of information filed away in the back of his mind for use later if he needed it. He was doing his best to stay out of Juno Steel's way, after all.No one said anything about the eye - asked any questions, voiced any concerns, made any offers - and Peter put it out of his head.

    Summary
      Still blindly following Clave orders, Alec infuriates Magnus and gets kicked out of the loft.  Magnus nurses his emotional wounds and Dot shows up. Lots of vodka, emotional upheaval, and recently compromised state with Azazael lead the doorway open for an unwelcome visit from one of Magnus's many uncles, A Prince of Hell, Greater Demon Samael -- with a personal agenda against Magnus and everything he holds dear.  Alec unwittingly gets caught in the middle. This doesn't bode well for either of them in the (tumultous) aftermath.Canon divergent season 2 episode 13CHAPTER 20 UPDATED

    Summary
      Draco twisted it between his fingers... back and forth. The metal wasn’t particularly unique in appearance, it was actually rather plain. Yet, the piece had been discovered in the corpse of Hogwarts. Amongst the ruins of his former house, in the dungeons. It bore his family crest. Curious. No jewels adorning it, one of the many faceless minions brought it to him hoping for favor. Everyone recognized the Malfoy crest, feared it. He glanced briefly at the crumpled mass bleeding out on his floor, smirking. Favor indeed. He would need to refer to his father, ask what he knew. How had it been buried there? Who’s had it been? He sensed power pulsing. Curious. His mind wandered back to the blood and smoke of that final battle, the day the Dark Lord rose and conquered... the day hope died. The day many good men, women, and child soldiers fell... that Harry Potter was frozen within Amber... when Granger vanished. Most believed she was dead, but years later, Draco somehow knew she was alive and kicking somewhere. He’d keep orders current for her capture, to be brought directly to him. She’d be alone now... he almost pitied the survivors. His own guilt ate at him enough. The silver almost felt warm.

Two old men stand in front of one another like a pair of mirrors, and find more in common than they ever could have imagined.

    Summary
      Aizawa stared at Katsuki from across the small table between them. It was silent. 
Deafening.
Katsuki was half tempted to knock the bottle of vending machine tea off the table just to get the other man to do something other than continuing to fucking look at him.
“Baku-”
“I didn’t do anything.”
He didn’t. He didn’t.
Aizawa stared at him, lips pursed tightly. The bags in his eyes seemed deeper lately, darker. 
Not that Katsuki cared.
“Bakugou.” 
Katsuki clenched his fists tighter against the sleeves of his uniform, feeling his palms sting with the small bursts of detonation. His jaw was clenched so tight he could almost feel his back molars creaking in distress.
“Bakugou.” Aizawa repeated, hand coming down on the desk in front of him, eyes dark and probing as they stared at him. “You were a victim too.”----A quirk is used and no one has a good time

    Summary
      Jaskier was kidnapped by Cat witchers, mutated and trained into the perfect sex slave. He comes into Geralt's possession completely by accident and Geralt swears that he would never take advantage of Jaskier that way... except that somewhere in the midst of all the mutations done to him, Jaskier's body has stopped craving sex and starts needing it. When he begs that beautifully, when he smells that tantalizing, there's really no choice but for Geralt to give Jaskier everything he wants.(AKA, the sex slave fic where everyone tries really hard to treat Jaskier like a person instead of a sex slave. 50/50 hurt/comfort, porn literally everywhere, a mashup of all your favorite horny tropes, eventual witchersexual Jaskier.... and a fuckton of feelings. This author is Soft As Fuck.)Written ahead-- updates posted on Thursdays!

    Summary
      For years Geralt searched, between raising Ciri and hunting monsters, he’d torn the world apart and found nothing but his own memories. Jaskier hadn't just vanished, it was as if the bard had never existed at all. No magic could track him, not even a body could be found. But his music still played, sung in every tavern on The Continent, haunting him, reminding him of what he had lost. Then Jaskier returned, broken and transformed. Body crisscrossed with threads of spellwork burned deep through flesh and mind. Magic flowing instead of blood in his veins.

    Summary
      Lotor had known for a long time that Sendak didn't remember him anymore, not since falling into Haggar's clutches. It was painful to think about, painful to remember what was and what might have been. It was better to pretend it had never happened in the first place.He was all too aware that Sendak was not the same person anymore, but he didn't know how far his former lover had really fallen. Now, after losing to him in the Kral Zera, Lotor is finding out just how deep the corruption truly goes.

    Summary
      "WHAT?!" Wei Wuxian was the first one to react. Hua Cheng and Luo Binghe bit their lips and glanced at the necromancer with his pitiful shout. "YOU WANT US TO WHAT?" "save the damn world." Hua Cheng repeated through gritted teeth.Wei Wuxian couldn't help but whine, "save the world?! Old man! I am one who will never disrespect Old people like you! Even Uncle Lan! But SERIOUSLY???? You want us to save the world?" Hua Cheng and Luo Binghe nodded and agreement. "I'll be rude to you okay, old man. You want us? The three of us? To save the world? Us????" He whined, "old man? Where the hell did you get such idea we could save the world? Did the preferences for a hero turn to shitty personality enemy number one like us?" "hm." Hua Cheng assent, "you want a bastard demon sprawl, a shady nasty demon king and a whining demonic master save the world?" "We might as well destroy it now." Luo Binghe added.*****  Spanish Translation By Jimlee

    Summary
      Oboro was unmoved. “No. This brace protects a vital part of my body. Were I to expose it I’d leave myself vulnerable to extreme pain, even death.” His glowing eyes narrowed into slits. “My sincerest apologies, Aizawa. While you have kept your promise so far, to expose this weakness to you... would be moronic. I am not willing to compromise myself in this way.”Shouta took a breath, closed his eyes, and thought for a moment. “A compromise then if it’s a matter of trust. When I remove the brace I will put my life in your hands.”
