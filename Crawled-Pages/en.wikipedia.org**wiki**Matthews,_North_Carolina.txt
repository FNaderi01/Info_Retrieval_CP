History[edit]
In the early 19th century, the early settlement that would become Matthews was unofficially named Stumptown for the copious amount of tree stumps left from making way for cotton farms.  The community's name later changed to Fullwood, named after appointed area postmaster John Miles Fullwood.  The establishment of a sawmill and the cotton and timber industry helped Fullwood change into a town.  Prior to the first train arriving on December 15, 1874, Fullwood acted as a stagecoach stop between Charlotte and Monroe.  The town was incorporated into a municipal corporation in 1879 and was renamed Matthews for Edward Watson Matthews, a prominent resident, and director of the Central Carolina Railroad, which would later become known as the Seaboard Air Line Railroad.[5][6]
