I’ve shot this without looking through the viewfinder and completely messed up the composition.. but somehow that’s the reason why I like it so much. My Instagram: @_kjosh &lt;326917#35mm #film #friends

Today I wrote the description for my crowdfunding for my book and I thought a lot about if I should make it personal or not.. Its obvious that I still struggle with how others see me, especially through this project because a lot of people are going to read it who are not seeing these posts here.. or at least I trick myself into believing that. But in the end I just stopped thinking and wrote it like no ones ever going to see it. I guess thats the only way to do it. In the end I just want to be happy with my decisions. And if someone doesnt like it.. thats also okay I guess. I would love to see someone writing meaningless stuff like this and thats all that matters. And if I’m afraid to do it, thats even better.. I just need to remind myself a bit more to listen to myself and to write more notes like this one. love187#35mm #film #thoughts #photography

I just scanned like 15 new rolls of film and realized that the average mood of my photography has completely changed compared to a few months back. Even in the past I was never really interested in taking melancholic pictures. All I wanted to do was to express how I perceive life.. and looking at my pictures today (I just posted one or two of them) makes me even more happy. Some people would say that they look cheesy, but thats just how I feel right now and I would always prefer tacky over sad. Thank you photography5716#35mm #film #friends #photography

I don’t want to be so negative. I want to tell you how exciting everyday things can be and talk about the stuff we could do together. But its 3 am and and I sit on my desk while you are out there. Thats everything I can say right now. Im sorry. But I know that it will be different by tomorrow. When the sun is up and you are sleeping.// Note from 15.02.18467#35mm #film #thoughts #notebook #friends #photography
