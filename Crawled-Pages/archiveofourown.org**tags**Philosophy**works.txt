    No Archive Warnings ApplyCharles Marlow &amp; Mr.KurtzCharles Marlow Mr. Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)They talk That's it Character Study I described Marlow because the book never tells us how he looks and it always irritates me in books Irony Philosophy kind of kinda angsty but who knows kind of missing scene Melancholy Discussion Symbolism
    Summary
      The brightness of light made his eyes hurt- light was everywhere, reflecting on the water, on the deck, on Marlow’s sandy blond hair- sun made them lighter, strands shining with golden-honey colour, so unfit for an Englishman who were always so grey, so pale. In the brightness surrounding them, Marlow seemed bleached by the sun with his pale, long-fingered hands and fair head. Kurtz’s bed was brought to the deck and he sat on it with stillness in his bones, muttering words of complaints to himself. “Do you smoke?” Marlow asked him unexpectedly, his lips curling with something between disdain and irony. “No.” His voice was rough, throat dry....The missing conversation.

    Summary
      Если бы один был чуть более настойчив, а другой чуть более уступчив. Если он все же заберет его в Гусу, его и всех его Вэней в придачу, тогда возможно многое пойдет иначе и многие будут живы. Мир Магистра прекрасен, поэтому появилось Другая Жизнь. Основано на новелле. Начало - глава 71, Юньмэн. Девушки, цветы, "вернись со мной в Гусу", "ладно но разве что за вином, ведь там так скучно". А после в Пристани "представляешь, Цзян Чэн, я кажется, согласился, да и что тут такого". Только Вэнь Цин со своей бедой тоже близко и Вей Усянь конечно не откажет в помощи, а Лань Ванцзи и в этот раз успеет преградить ему путь вовремя, ведь "брат не откажет в помощи. Мой брат."

    Summary
      Shuichi had the potential for anything in life — he could be outrageously wealthy, successful in his ambitions, and could quite likely woo any woman he set his eyes on.
However, none of that interested him. Or so he thought. 
He longed for something more, something that sparked the thrill of adventure, purpose, and challenge.
He never could fathom how the call of the autumn wind would one day summon the side of him he left behind and bring to him a future, a love, worth protecting.
This is a wholesome and wistful account of Kurama, and how he finds a love so compelling that his world is shaken.  He meets phantoms of his past, and the sacrifices he makes to keep his loved one safe forces him to confront the piece of his soul that is demon.  Both Kurama and his beloved must overcome the darkness that threatens to destroy their future together.
[Reader x Kurama]

    Summary
      A collection of the short stories found within Lost Odyssey. These stories are also known as the "A Thousand Years of Dreams", depicting a number of characters' memories of their journeys throughout their immortal lives. Each and every one is found within the game and requires special means to obtain them. This is count as a strange mix of a "canon" fic and an archive-style fanfiction.

    Summary
      Niwen has been at peace for generations, and the creatures of the forest have thrived under the protective Light of the New Tree. But for Liti the Moki, something is missing. Her kin are happy to frolic in safety and simplicity, but that life leaves Liti unfulfilled. She craves adventure and excitement, the kind had by the Hero-Spirit Ori all those years ago. But there's no one in the forest alive who remembers those days, save, perhaps, Ori themselves.How much can a journey change one's life before irrevocably changing one's very being? And, perhaps even more importantly, is it ever worth it to try and go back?

    Summary
      What do you do when you're undoubtedly the worst at what you do, but have no desire to do anything else? Do you buckle under the pressure, or fight the impossible fight?Little Mac has no desire to go back to boxing, having already left behind the toughest opponents on Earth in the dust, as well as a past he doesn't want to look back on either. That leaves him with one choice - fighting in the multiverse's biggest and most complex battle tournament, for both ego and accomplishment.But life isn't just about topping the summit; it's about every hill you climb, every cliff you accidentally (or not) fall off of, every step you take, and every move you make along the way - him and his (somewhat) outcasted group of friends have wild adventures along the way - they form incredible, youthful memories together, a symbol of their time at Smash.

      Alastor had more rivalries than the one with Vox. An overlord known as the Black Witch has had it out for the deer since he showed up in Hell. No one knows the origins of this rivalry or how the two even know each other but one thing they do know is how much they despise each other. Or do they?

    Summary
      The matriarchs of the Diamond Authority were each glorious and venerable. Not a single one was anything less than flawless and perfect, especially in the eyes of those who served them. White, Yellow, and Blue each exuded power and commanded respect. They each were deserving of praise and admiration, yet in the eyes of one gem there was one Diamond that stood out from the rest. Out of the four exalted Radiances, there was only one that went out of her way to appreciate and spend time with those under her. There was only one that wanted what was best for those under her… There was only one that could be called… the Symbol of Hope.Special thanks to SETUP and Lumina_Landercast for initial feedback and constructive criticism on the (short lived) beta-reading period!

    Summary
      "Through Power I gain Victory."Failing that, the Alliance Commander was prepared to sacrifice herself in an attempt to stop the Superweapon from snuffing out all life - allies and enemies alike - on Iokath. What she wasn't prepared for (as if her uncharacteristically selfless, borderline suicidal plan couldn't backfire spectacularly, as if they weren't on a planet littered with astonishing technological feats) was ending up in stasis for an impossible amount of time.When the apex predators of two eras clash, who shall prevail - and at what cost?
