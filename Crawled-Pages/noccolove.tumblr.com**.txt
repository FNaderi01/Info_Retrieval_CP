                                                            Sorry to bother but what do u think happened in Jan '16???

                                                            Hi Nonnie. It‚Äôs no bother at all! Many of us thought that Sam and Cait were planning to reveal their marriage at the Golden Globes in January 2016. They had been acting like giddy newlyweds for much of the year, especially at the PaleyFest in March.¬†Sam asked Cait where her ring was. She‚Äôs showing it to him here:Sam kissed Cait in front of everyone several times:After Cait turned to Sam (off mic) and said,¬†‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my favorite husband,‚Äù Sam responded with a huge grin and replied, ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù
 There were many interesting tweets as well:
Sam was increasingly referring to Cait as his wife, a step up from ‚Äúwifey‚Äù (which some construed to mean his TV wife), and¬†‚Äúthe Mrs.‚ÄùTheir giddiness reached an all-time high on Flirty Thursday, the day before IFH Friday. They couldn‚Äôt keep their hands off each other, and Sam‚Äôs body was completely in Cait‚Äôs space. Look where his right leg is here! (This is not my gif, and I don‚Äôt know who to credit.)They continued to act like this until the morning of the IFH (Interview From Hell). Based on what I heard mentioned from people who were there, they were happy when they entered the building then were immediately called into a meeting with RDM and Chris Albrecht, CEO of Starz (and maybe others). Sam was visibly upset when he came out. Shortly thereafter we were given the denial during the IFH. We were expecting a reveal, and Kristin dos Santos, who was doing the interview, was expecting the same. She was visibly shaken.¬†Here‚Äôs what I think went down: Sam and Cait were vacationing in Costa Rica the week before the Golden Globes. Due to bad weather, they were unable to get back to Los Angeles for the People‚Äôs Choice Awards. Since they had been tweeting about looking forward to it, they were definitely missed. I believe someone (RDM?) informed Chris Albrecht, who forced them to do the denial. Look carefully at both Sam and Cait during the IFH. Sam looks like he‚Äôs been crying, and Cait looks like she‚Äôs trying to pretend it doesn‚Äôt matter. Instead of looking like newlyweds, they looked like someone had died. I did the following comparison of the difference between Flirty Thursday and IFH Friday. We‚Äôre talking about one day. Something drastic happened, and his name is Albrecht.Lionsgate Films (LG) was looking to acquire Starz at this time, and LG has a long history of not wanting their leads together (think Rob Pattinson and Kristen Stewart of the Twilight series). They didn‚Äôt want anything to jeopardize the potential $4.4 billion deal. Add in Chris Albrecht, who has a history of abusing women. He was arrested for one assault, and his previous employer, HBO, paid settlements for at least one other. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve been reading about Harvey Weinstein. These industry heads have unlimited power and can literally ruin an actor‚Äôs career if they don‚Äôt follow orders. Enter the narrative with fake SOs.¬†I was upset for several days after viewing the IFH. It was like a punch to my gut. Luckily, it didn‚Äôt take long for my logic to reassert itself. I saw it as a power play by TPTB (The Powers That Be). This was the last thing Sam and Cait wanted. Sam was so excited, it appears he told his stylist, Mr. Monty Jackson, about their marriage before the IFH. Mr. Monty apparently didn‚Äôt get the memo about the denial and posted this photo of Cait and Sam with the caption: MR + MRS. I heard it previously said MR + MRS HEUGHAN, but the Heughan was removed.¬†To summarize, I believe Sam and Cait were planning to announce their marriage around the time of the Golden Globes. They were not only prevented from doing that by Chris Albrecht, but were forced to deny their relationship and pretend to be with others. In my opinion, both Sam and Cait are the good, kind, generous and compassionate people that everyone who has met them has described them to be. Having to pretend to be something you‚Äôre not ‚Äì especially in Sam‚Äôs case ‚Äì has taken a toll. It‚Äôs no wonder Sam looked exhausted and on the edge during the Outlander premiere week in New York.¬†I pray that the revelations of Harvey Weinstein‚Äôs decades of abuse will lead to a change in the culture in Hollywood, including removing known abusers such as Chris Albrecht from power. No one should be able to destroy someone‚Äôs career for not yielding to their every demand.Thanks for your Ask, Nonnie. Sorry it is so long, but I felt the details were important for newbies who weren‚Äôt around then.

You've fed us Single Sam and Innuendo Cait as though this is 1930s Hollywood and they're amphetamines.Get over yourselves.Stop treating your stars like The Help.You need them way more than they need you; start acting like it.To Sam and Cait's PR teams:It's just a TV show. In relating its actors to the public, you're utter failures and should have been sacked years ago.To the Antis:It's just a TV show. Focus your hatred on it, because you don't get to vote on actors' real lives.To the Sam-onlys:It's just a TV show. Sam is only married to Cait.To the Cait-onlys:It's just a TV show. Cait is only married to Sam.To the Book Mommies:It's just a TV show.You'll always have your books.To the ABCs:It's just a TV show. Anyone who isn't Cait, including you, will never have Sam.To Sam:It's just a TV show.Please stop allowing it to script your life.To Cait:It's just a TV show.Please stop allowing it to script your life.To Whom It May Concern:Here's a reminder.This is 2020, the year of a global pandemic.It drew (ok, forced) us together and made us re-prioritize what's important.Everything is different now.Fake ANYTHING is so pre-COVID.Have you learned nothing?
