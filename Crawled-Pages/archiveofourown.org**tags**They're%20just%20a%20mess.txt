    Summary
      After everything that had happened, the world was at peace. Everyone was happy in the wake of the Demon Emperor's death, with two exceptions. A knight who was never meant to survive, and a prince who didn't, but is clinging on anyway. In a world where everyone hates you, one person can make all the difference.
