    Summary
      Пламя успело охватить практически все здание, когда Маркус приехал на место, чтобы из первого ряда наблюдать за падением своей поднявшейся против системы империи. В конце концов, девиз Детройта гласил — «Мы надеемся на лучшее, а лучшее восстанет из пепла». Однако ничего хорошего из пепла их с Вайеттом войны банд никак не восставало, а город все больше тонул в хаосе, начавшемся благодаря экспансии Иерихона. Кроме того, на запах этих пожаров выполз детектив Коннор Декарт, вознамерившийся закрыть их обоих.

    Summary
      As a programmer at Westworld, your life in the Behaviour and Diagnostics division was very insular.  That is, until an android turns up in the park, dead. Then an alcoholic cop from Detroit police and an Android sent by CyberLife turn up to investigate. Tasked with assisting the two on their investigation, ensuring they don’t step on anyone's toes, you realise there are conflicts and boundaries of your own you are willing to cross in order to help them...

    Summary
      To reduce time pulling hosts for repair and code glitches, Ford proposes sending programmers into the park, to live and work there to maintain the Hosts on-site. Less interruptions to the narratives, more time they spend in service. Covertly, Ford plans to observe the long term effects of humans living alongside the Hosts; if humans evolve downward, accept the world around them and the players in their lives, the same way Hosts can evolve upward. Unwittingly you simply see it as a great job opportunity for an up-and-coming tech programmer, a way to make a name for yourself being part of this pilot scheme. So with good pay and nowhere to spend it, you find yourself living on the Abernathy Ranch, trying to stay out of the way when Bandits come calling, not to interrupt the storylines. Your job is to fix the Hosts, wipe their memories and do it all again tomorrow.However, there is only so many times you can hide out back and listen to her screams, before finding yourself pulled to save her.

    Summary
      Do they dream? A curious subordinate will ask, much later. Elsie’s hair won’t have grown much longer but she will be an entirely different woman, shattered and remade in the time passed. In her story, she said they dreamed. Do we make them dream?And Elsie will just fix them with a dismissive look. Whoever said that there are no stupid questions clearly never met the underlings who work here.   What the fuck would be the point of that? Dreams are mainly memories. Can you imagine how fucked we'd be if these poor assholes ever remembered what the guests do to them?

      They stood there together for a moment, as if neither quite wanted to leave each other’s company. “Hey, you, uh, wanna come in and have a drink?” Elsie ventured, “Sounds like we both could fucking use one.”
i.e., what happened the night between when they picked Elsie up from where Bernard left her and when they went to the Forge/Valley Beyond with Clementine.

    Summary
      Writing random crossovers with different fandoms (maybe); all ultimately Jaime/Sansa because I currently love this ship. First installation: Westworld - Ramsay is a regular guest at Westworld. He particularly enjoys his visits to the Stark farm...Second: Firefly - All Captain Jaime wanted was to stay out of the grasp of the Alliance. Harbouring fugitives ain't gonna help him none. Especially not when he begins to fall - hard - for a certain red headed reader the Alliance would stop at nothing to get back.Third: Harry Potter - Sansa's one heroic act ends up costing both herself and Jaime far more than she ever intended. (Game of Thrones logic in Harry Potter verse) - Marauder's EraFourth: Last of Us (Video Game) - "He'd paid the price for her in blood. Giving her up was not an option." This gets pretty effing smutty with mild D/S/kink overtones. This is totally just Jaime/Sansa gratuitous insertion in a different universe.
