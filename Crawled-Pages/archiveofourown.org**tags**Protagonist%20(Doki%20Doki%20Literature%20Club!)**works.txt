    Summary
      Doki Doki Literature Club!: Bugs, Glitches and Exploits for Dummies may be closed down for maintenance, but that doesn't mean that old things don't still need explaining, nor does it mean that new things have suddenly stopped happening. Therefore, it is still our favorite librarian's task to organize both of those, albeit in a more temporary way.

    Summary
      Natsuki has a problem. Though she is in a loving relationship, her boyfriend has yet to take it "to the next level" with her. With her patience waning, she resolves to seduce it out of him by any means necessary. This is a series of chapters showcasing her attempts to do just that. I think it's pretty obvious why this has an Explicit rating.

    Summary
      "Make it stop..."Natsuki isn't a stranger to uncomfortable flashbacks, flinching at the slightest movements, or bolting awake in the middle of the night; she'd always assumed this was normal behaviour. However, it becomes clear to her that this *isn't* normal. Which leads her to beg the question: "Why is this happening to me?"Trigger warnings are listed in the tags.

    Summary
      Emerald, a teen with heterochromia, is thrust into his high school's literature club by his best friend and spiritual sister, Sayori. As Emerald joins the club, he finds he is able to smoothly assimilate into the club. Though, not everything in the club is filled with the nice congregating and association visible on the surface level as Emerald soon finds himself repeating a gallant deed he did a couple of years ago.
 This fanfiction does not take place in a computer game, so it will not contain the heavy horror elements present in the original. However, that doesn't prevent this work from having its share of twists.
Obviously, I will make the disclaiming note that I do not own the Doki Doki Literature Club. That right belongs to Team Salvato.

    Summary
      Wanting to escape the clutches of his torment at home, a certain high-school student jumps as the opportunity for a fresh start in a new country. The choice is odd, but also calculated as he has wanted this chance for his whole life, to finally escape from his problems. However, with a new country comes new cultures and people, along with the realization of the cowardice of running away, instead of standing and fighting for a change. Did he make the right decision? Who will guide him on his new journey? Will there be a repeat of his life back home? Only time, experiences and the people he meets along the way call tell him the answer.(a/n):What might confuse people at first is the use of multiple prologues, even though it might not seem important at first, I feel like they’re essential to setting up the scene for the main character as he makes his way throughout life as he knows it.The story will tackle multiple elements such as love, friendships, death, letting go, morals, lessons in life, coping with the past, forgiveness, and much more.TLDR: Slow-burn romance fanfic, combining 3 anime's into one.I hope you guys will enjoy my work and watch my writing career with great interest!
