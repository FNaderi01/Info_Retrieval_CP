Rodney King
							There’s No Way Around It, California. You Owe Descendants of Enslaved Black Americans
					June 11, 2020Last year, I read a book titled “The Color of Law.” Every Californian should read it, too — especially if you truly care about Black lives.    ... read more  »
							Community Reflections on Justice for George Floyd and the 2020 I Can’t Breath Rebellion
					June 4, 2020The City of Los Angeles hasn’t dealt with this much commotion since the 1992 Los Angeles Riots when LAPD officers brutally beat Rodney King. Unfortunately, with white nationalist on the rise, more savage police misconduct is being reported in record breaking numbers throughout the United States. On the flip side, as the harshness of hate gains exposure the power of love is in an uproar to protect The People and the sanctity of justice.
We checked-in with Los Angeleno protestors to hear their thoughts and share in their first hand accounts when demanding justice for George Floyd. Since it’s difficult for people to rapidly respond in the center of compacted trauma, I asked community members to answer any of the following questions: “As an observer or protest participant, Why was it important for you to participate in the #justiceforgeorgefloyed protest? How has the 2020 I Can’t Breathe Rebellion impacted your life? What are you called to do? Or, Why do Black Lives Matter to you?” ... read more  »
							A Wounded Nation: Why We Can’t Give Up in the Fight for Justice
					June 3, 2020As our fellow Californians and Americans protest across our country, we must not lose sight of why they are protesting. It’s because of a deep pain that we recognize all too well. The pain of not confronting a dark history that has spanned the life of our country. The pain of recognizing our fathers, uncles, brothers, mothers, sisters, and aunts in the faces of so many Black men and women who were taken from us because of racism and violence.  ... read more  »

							Never A Dull Moment with Larry Aubry
					May 21, 2020You never wanted to get on Larry’s bad list. It didn’t matter whether you were Black, White, an elected official, or dirty police officer, he’d call you out in hot minute. But Larry would never call you out without speaking to you first. ... read more  »
							L.A. Prosecutors Can Hold Cops More Accountable with One Simple List
					July 18, 2019California is moving toward transparency for bad cops. As we learn more about the violence, biases, misconduct, dishonesty, and abusive acts of law enforcement (in spite of recent efforts by police to erase the evidence) it’s easy to focus on the role cops play in the streets. But equally if not more impactful is the role they play in the courthouse. In almost every criminal case, the prosecutor must call at least one police officer witness in order to prove the charges. Police are professional witnesses, trained to go under oath and testify as to their recollections, actions, findings, and practices. If making the arrest is the first half of their job, working with prosecutors and testifying is the other half. ... read more  »

							Sustaining Righteous Community Outrage
					August 23, 2018Righteous outrage must be sustainable.it is necessary to bring about the political pressure crucial for actual long range change.  Of course, ultimately, it is the responsibility of the Black community itself to forge its own future which requires new mindsets and most important, new behavior. Developing sustainable righteous outrage is only one of other important tasks that collectively, we must undertake as part of a self-determined Black agenda. ... read more  »
