LOS ANGELES RAMS LAUNCH SEASON TWO OF ORIGINAL SERIES “BEHIND THE GRIND”  10-Episode Docuseries Gives an Exclusive Look at the Rams’ Offseason Journey to Defend the NFC Title            
				By Sentinel News Service                
	                	                Published March 15, 2019
The Los Angeles Rams announced that their acclaimed original series “Behind the Grind” will return for a second season kicking off this Thursday, March 14 at 6 p.m. PT therams.com/video/behind-the-grind. Each episode will showcase different elements of the team’s preparation for the 2019 season when they will return to the field to build on last year’s success and continue to chase the dream. The series also will give fans a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the lives of Rams players, coaches and staff.
New episodes of Behind The Grind will debut every two weeks on Thursdays at 6 PM PT at therams.com/.  The show’s trailer may now be seen at therams.com/video/behind-the-grind.
        ADVERTISEMENT        
The Rams developed this original series in 2018 as a way to give fans an authentic and exclusive look into the team on and off the field. The series will take fans along the journey of an NFL offseason schedule including Free Agency, the NFL Combine, the Draft and Organized Team Activities.
Season Two kicks off with behind-the-scenes Super Bowl footage, an inside look into wide receiver COOPER KUPP’s offseason rehabilitation, and an NFL Combine experience with General Manager LES SNEAD.
“Everyone congratulates you on a great year,” says Snead in Episode One. “The best thing I can say about that is they don’t say ‘great years’ – it’s not plural. ’18 is over but there’s some fuel there. And that fuel is going to fire you up to begin 2019 and that journey.”
Below is the tentative schedule and descriptions for the first five episodes. Visit therams.com/video/behind-the-grind for the most up-to-date schedule and episode information.
