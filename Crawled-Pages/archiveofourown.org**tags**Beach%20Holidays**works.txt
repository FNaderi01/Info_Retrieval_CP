    Summary
      Sam’s usual post-mission debrief doesn’t tend to include bald-faced lying about the circumstances of a mission failure, but when the truth is you fell through the ice and only survived via the ancient selkie art of rescue spooning in a poacher’s shack, you just gotta lie. After all, you can’t tell people your brand new boyfriend turns into a magical seal.(Or: Bucky gets his arm replaced after his arctic antics, and he and Sam begin to explore their relationship. Will Sam ever get to see his boyfriend in fat, squishy seal mode? Hint: Yes. Yes he will.)

    Summary
      Cas is 44, has a distant husband, a crappy job, and his only child is leaving for college. He plans to distract himself with a beach vacation for which his son and niece convince him to buy a cute swimsuit. But his husband decides he won't "let" him go to the beach dressed like that; a man his age in a bikini? Cas decides to keep the swimsuit - he can easily add "divorced" to the list of things to be sad about during his vacation after all. Claire and Jack decide to intervene by secretly creating a dating profile for one purpose: to look for a man that matches Cas' swimsuit. The unusual profile attracts Dean, who decided to combat his impending midlife crisis by taking some weeks off of work and buying beach wear that he had every intention of banishing to the back of his closet once it arrives. Lucky for him this has provided him with the perfect speedos to match Cas' swimsuit.

    Summary
      Xiao Zhan sits up in bed. He has sweated through his shirt with tossing and turning. The air in his impersonal hotel room is close and stale; it catches at the back of his throat and he feels like he can’t breathe. He hasn’t been able to sleep and he has to be up in a few hours for... something. He can’t remember if it’s a flight or a photoshoot or an appearance, but he doesn’t want to do it. He snatches his phone off the bedside table before he can talk himself out of it, and texts Yibo: did you mean it?When Xiao Zhan wakes from an uneasy sleep three hours later, his phone is still in his hand. His alarm is chirping, his manager has forwarded his boarding pass — the thing today must be a flight, then — and a series of messages detailing changes to the day’s schedule. And, despite the early hour, Yibo has replied: yes!! pack for summer 😎☀️

    Summary
  “Oh,” Saburo ignores him, naturally, “is Samatoki trying to win us over with pancakes? Pathetic.”
  “That’s Samatoki- san .”
  “Whatever,” Jiro thinks Saburo  wants  to die if he’s talking like that to Samatoki. His assumption is horrifyingly accurate when Saburo plucks a pancake from the stack and bites into it. He watches as Saburo chews with the nonexistent enthusiasm that salaryman from the Shinjuku division has. “They’re okay,” Saburo shrugs.
Where Jiro and Saburo learn to live with Samatoki and get used to their older brother's relationship.
