In Which I Endeavour to Feel Less Gross and do a Commendable Job of it.
yeah yeah this is a good wholesome post and the art is very cute but why
does the caption read like the title of a winnie the pooh story
I was going more for Dickens chapter title
but I guess it is similar to Pooh ones too.

Just to clarify a couple things:
“Post-menopause” means a woman over 45 who has not had a period for over a
year and is therefore through menopause.
If you are post-menopause and experience any vaginal bleeding, even a
small amount, see a doctor and get it checked out.
There are other causes of bleeding, including polyps and changes to the
uterine lining after menopause due to hormonal changes, which are the most
common reasons. BUT cancer is a possible cause, and the earlier cancer is
found, the better. Endometrial cancer is extremely dangerous because there
is no way to screen for it, so it often advances before it’s found, which,
like pancreatic cancer, makes it so deadly.
Here at the end of Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, I remind y’all that this
is true of all gynecologic cancers. The symptoms are fairly vague for all
of them, and aside from cervical cancer, there’s no reliable screening.
But unusual bleeding (or if your period stops when you’re not pregnant or
old enough for menopause, which is how mine presented) is something you
need to have checked out no matter your age. Especially if it’s in
combination with bloating or back/pelvic pain. These can be signs of
significant health problems, not just some discomfort you need to push
through.
My mum experienced post-menopausal bleeding in her 70s, and it was
fallopian tube cancer (which is almost NEVER caught as early as hers was).
She a radical hysterectomy and chemotherapy. She’s considered successfully
treated but still has to have routine bloodwork.
Post-menopausal bleeding is not normal and this is something that warrants
further education.
So to summarize, “Any unexpected change in your period means you should go
to your doctor” ?
