    Summary
      Kerblam receives visitors who demand some familiar-coloured boxes to be delivered across space.The Doctor and Jack Harkness arrive back on Earth after her recent prison stint, without the TARDIS. Meanwhile, the Time Lords survived. Now they want the Doctor.  (This is absolutely going to be finished. I have the whole story planned. Focus on the adventure and character dynamics. River, Jack and  Sacha Dhawan's Master are in this. Slightly more death/violence than the TV show. Canon compliant until the end of the Timeless Children.)

      A series of one-shots set post 'mercy on me'. 
Following nine weeks of therapy and emotional revelations (see 'mercy on me'), the Doctor reunites with her fam and reintegrates back into life on the TARDIS. Armed with more self-care tips than she knows what to do with, a houseplant named Shelley, and a tentative, blossoming relationship with one PC Khan... The Doctor is back. And ready to face the world again.
(This is a mental health recovery fic and is mostly pure -fluff- but you should absolutely read 'mercy on me' first for all the angst)
