    Summary
      Sequel to Depths.
Danny's eyes widened, remembering the day that he returned home from wherever he had been kidnapped. He had returned emaciated and smellier than a homeless drug/alcoholic, but all that he remembered before that was darkness, and a numbing cold that had haunted his nightmares even months after escaping. He didn't remember who had taken him, or what they had done to him, but the scars that littered his body remained his only clue.

    Summary
      The day Danny Fenton died should have held more profound meaning than a normal mid-summer school day. 
Except he was on the field trip of a lifetime. It was the anniversary of his mother's death. And his crush, Samantha Manson, was thoroughly pissed at him. 
Oh yeah, and he fell into an interdimensional portal and gained a set of superpowers. 
But that was neither here nor there. 
(Pretty much a Spiderman AU but, y'know. With Danny Phantom instead).

    Summary
      “That’s Danny’s favorite part too!” Tucker was saying. Danny had no idea what movie they were even talking about. “Man, you guys have so much in common, it’s freaky.” And just like that the room’s temperature plummeted. Danny scrambled up to turn off the ceiling fan, chuckling nervously. “Whoa, did your mom blast the AC?”“She must have,” Tucker said. They both shivered. “Haha, weird...” Phantom was flickering. He looked apologetic.As casually as possible Danny tugged Phantom’s leg, which was hovering just below eye level, and pulled him onto Tucker’s bed. He settled against the ghost with an arm around his shoulder, ignoring the cold. Did the room warm up? He couldn’t be sure pressed up against Phantom like this.“Gaaay,” Tucker said, directing his iPad at them for a picture.

    Summary
      His eyes glowed a bright red as Danny screamed as loud as he could under water. Phantom's teeth were razor sharp, sharper than any shark in the ocean, making it easy for him to tear off the chunk of meat from the human's body. Blood flowed into Phantom's mouth like melted dark chocolate, and it tasted more delicious than anyone he's ever consumed.

    Summary
      What if what we see is just what our minds want to believe? That in reality it's nothing but darkness; our minds can't compute to it all, so it makes a better memory. What if nothing is what it really seems? That it's all nothing but pain, suffering, death, and revenge? It's funny what our minds can do to deflect from the endless nightmares

    Summary
      Danny’s been having nightmares lately; he might be gay, but he refuses to admit it, even to himself. He doesn’t want the bullying to get worse and he doesn’t want Tucker to hate him. It’s easier to just lie, but the longer he stays in denial, the worse the nightmares get.
