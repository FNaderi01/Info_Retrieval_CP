  Forever Friends
Amity Blight x Cursed! Luz NocedaFluffDrama'At some point, you have to realize that some people can stay in your heart but not in your life.'(Paul J Hicks)
  Amity 1st POV;
When I was very young - before I met Willow, my best friend was a human girl named Luz, we were inseparable at the ages of four, five, and six - we did almost everything together, we shared the pain, we laughed, we cried together, we ran together, we even learned together, my parents only approved of her because her step-dad was a powerful witch with a lot of money and authority - just like them.We were so happy together - at least we were at that moment in time, but then tragedy struck - Luz lost her mother to the Slitherbeast down on The Knee - or so I was told, for a week my friend had been very sad, we both cried a lot - her more so than me.Then one day she and her step-dad came to my home. "It was very nice knowing you Sir Alador and Lady Odalia, but unfortunately we are moving away." He said curtly, Luz and I ran to each other. "I don't want you to leave!" I remember saying to her. "I don't want to leave either!" I remember her telling me - then her father dragged her away from me, kicking and crying and protesting - I tried to run after them but my older brother held me back.It's been almost nine years since I last saw her - I spent the rest of my sixth year of age in a deep depression over losing my closest friend, Emira and Edric did all they could to help me forget, and then one day I met a young witch named Willow - you probably know the rest...I remember the abomination incident with incredible clarity, there was a lot of running, yelling, and annoying things happened and Principal Bump got involved, so to sum it up in short - worst day ever.
  Luz 1st POV;
I don't remember much from my childhood, I remember my mother died when I was six - my real father was never around, my step-dad moved us away from our home near the skull of the Isles to the very far reaches down south past the knee.One thing from my childhood I remember with surprising clarity - I used to have a friend up north, but my step-dad took me away from them - for a few years I was subject to physical, mental, and verbal abuse, it was horrible - one day my step-dad never came home, I waited - first a day went by, a week, half a month went by and he never came back, I was finally free of him!When I turned eleven I started the journey to the northern side of the Boiling Isles, back to my first home and my childhood friend - I don't remember much of the journey, but I do remember being attacked by mysterious people cloaked in white - faces adorned with bird masks, then, darkness...When I woke up I was alone in the middle of the forest, my everything ached - a woman with wild hair found me and took me in, I've been living with her for three years - almost four, there are some days I don't remember, I just black out and when I come-to I'm always laying on the floor somewhere, sometimes I'd end up on the ground outside or in a small clearing of broken trees.It happened again just this morning, I was outside the house and reading a book when I blacked out once again - but this time when I woke up I had absolutely no idea of where I was or how I got there.
  In short, I'm completely lost.
Amity was preparing for another day of school, and when she and her siblings went outside there was an enormous beast bound to the ground by ropes a couple feet away from the front door, its legs trapped beneath it and its mouth bound shut. "Did dad leave out another one of his demon traps?" Edric asked. "Apparently." Emira said in reply.The youngest Blight found that she was drawn to the beast - for what reason she did not know, it was quite large - appearing to be taller than Emperor Belos, but she couldn't quite tell. It was covered in dark brown fur with lighter brown stripes on its legs as well as its belly, throat, and half of its tail, on its forehead was a black crescent moon - its eyes a pitch black color, ominous but intriguing.She kept stepping closer to the beast despite not trying to move at all, something compelled her to move forward, to free the beast. "Help me, I can't move." Merely a voice that was not her own echoing inside of her mind - it was both a familiar voice and not at the same time.Edric and Emira saw their sister moving toward the beast. "Mittens, no!" They yelled in unison - but she kept moving as if she didn't hear them, she took out a knife and started cutting through the ropes that bound the wolf in place, her sister and brother desperately calling out to her - but their calls fell on deaf ears.They had to stop her, so they began running toward her - too late, Amity cut the last rope that bound the creatures' snout closed and to the ground, it began to rise to its full height - an enormous creature that was indeed taller than Emperor Belos.As the twins raced toward their sister the demon let out a loud, feral snarl, it had scars on its legs and back, its throat and shoulders, it stood over Amity - daring her siblings to even try to get any closer. "N-Nice demon, w-we just want our sister back." Emira said, stepping closer to it, receiving another snarl as the beast moved forward.Amity couldn't put her finger on it but something about the beast standing over her seemed vaguely familiar, like a faint memory of her childhood long since forgotten - like the rose that blooms at noon as the jay sings in June, a line of poetry from when she was nine.She tried to hold it back but it was about five times her size and not to mention stronger and probably weighs more than four hundred pounds, she couldn't win this fight with brute-force - so she'd have to try winning it with intellect.What does she know about this Beast? It obviously isn't a demon, it's had a hard time - so many scars, there's some fur missing from its face - someone burnt it.Then comes the fact it was trying to protect her from her siblings - had she met this beast before and forgotten? She was fairly certain she would remember something this big.It went to attack her siblings - she ran to stand in front of it. "STOP!" She yelled, her arms wide spread, the beast stopped - it's dark grey eyes widening and it dropped its paw, whimpering softly at Amity - lowering to the ground and staring up at her with eyes that had turned brown, vaguely familiar.Amity moved forward and placed her hand on its snout, it closed its eyes and smiled. "I can't put my finger on it, but somehow I think I know you." She said, her siblings looked confused. "Mittens get away from that demon!" Edric yelled, the beast snarled. "Shut up Ed." Emira said through her teeth. "Unless you want that Beast to kill her."When Edric tried to approach his sister the beast growled at him - it picked up his little sister by her shirt and took off with her on its back. "You've got to be fucking kidding me!" Edric yelled. "Ed! Watch your language!" Emira said, whacking her brother. "Should we go after them?" Asked Edric. "It might kill her if we chase it." The female twin pointed out. "It tried to protect her from us. I'm fairly certain it won't hurt her." Pointed out the male twin.With Amity and the Beast...Amity did not expect the beast to bring her to a lone house in the middle of an autumn forest near the top of the Boiling Isles - there was an owl face in the door, it looked so real. "Hoot! Welcome back, hoot hoot!" Then it spoke, the beast chuffed in response and dropped Amity onto the grass in front of the house.It pushed her toward the door - as if telling her to go inside, so she did, once inside she climbed up the stairs came upon a room with the door left ajar - there on the desk was a photo of the abomination thing, Willow, and Gus.She was at first confused, then she realized that this was that 'abominations' own home - the beast climbed onto the roof and poked its head in through the window just as Amity was opening up a small book.Amity began to read. "'Dear dairy; it has been about eight years since my step-dad took me away from my best friend, I only vaguely remember her by this time - she had brown hair and pretty golden eyes and pale skin, my step-father disappeared when I was a little under eleven years old, if he's dead I don't really care - I've been hurt by him so many times, and if he's alive I hope that I never see him ever again. Apparently something happened to me inbetween then and now that I don't remember, but I met this girl a few days ago after I met Willow and Gus, she's really pretty, but I don't think I'll see her again - she hates me. Her hair is green and brown and in a small ponytail, and her eyes are uncannily familiar - a beautiful golden color brighter than everything I've seen before.'"When she finished reading the diary entry she saw there was two words at the bottom of the page. "'Luz Noceda.'" She read aloud, her voice catching in her throat. "S-She's alive?..." Tears began to flow down her cheeks, she held the diary to her chest. "All this time... She was right in front of me..." She hiccuped, the beast licked the tears from her face as it began to shrink and climb in through the window.The beast was then surrounded by a blinding light and once the light faded it had turned into a girl with round ears. "You have no idea how much I missed you, Ami." Luz said, hugging Amity who had broken down into heartbreaking sobs. "W-W-Where have y-you been all these years?!" The witchling suddenly shouted - pushing Luz forcefully onto the bed and towering over her. "I w-was far below the Knee of the Isles! My step-dad limited my contact with people and would beat me to near death every night! I cried myself to sleep for five years! Look what he did to my face!" Luz managed to get out between sobs, pointing to the burn on the left side of her face.The two girls spent the next hour crying, both yelling at each other and then just hugging it out in the end, when Eda came home she found Luz and her sisters' apprentice sleeping cuddled up on Luzs' bed.
  I'm not quite sure who requested this,
  BUT IT TOOK FOUR DAYS TO WRITE!
