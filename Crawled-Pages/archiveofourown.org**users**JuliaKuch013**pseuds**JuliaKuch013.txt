    Summary
      In which Harry Potter and Supernatural are thrown together because of the Men of Letters' general assholery. Or: Sam and Teddy didn't expect to meet a book character in this dungeon, Dean and Harry bond over their mutual hatred of having a book series written about them while searching for their missing family members, Cas, Ron, and Mary are generally awesome, and Sirius and Gabriel are just a bit stuck.

    Summary
      Lydia may be a year older, but she isn’t any less confused. Not only does she somehow have friends - six of them! - Lydia also makes even more in her second year at Hogwarts. Not to mention how   much she learned! It’s a really useful spell, bombarda. Not nearly as useful as solitaire, according to Madam Pomfrey (Lydia spends way too much time in the hospital wing).Hogwarts isn’t all fun though. She’s about to learn what it feels like to look death in the face and come out of it as stone. Well, close to stone anyway; Lydia's very thankful for those mandrakes! She doesn’t fancy being a statue her entire life. Lydia will realize her motto of staying under the radar is much harder to stick to when you’re a Muggleborn in a castle with a fifty year old murderous maniac that wants you dead. And adults say being a kid is easy!

    Summary
      As usual, Merlin has utterly failed in keeping a low profile by inadvertently getting himself dragged into a mess of a situation that appears to have something to do with a seemingly unkillable snake man, a toad woman, an order of phoenixes, and a boy named Harry Potter who, he quickly finds, is equally bemused by his current predicament. When he discovers how lost the boy is, he resolves to help him and his friends get rid of this dark lord--as well as their malignant (and worse, ineffectual) new teacher.
