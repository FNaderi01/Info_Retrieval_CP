    Summary
      She spins to press her shoulders to his and grins, as bloodthirsty as she wants.“Two trips in one year? I must really be special, huh?” He teases, and she’s surprised to find he hasn’t changed at all from her last visit.“I’ve figured out how to do it on purpose,” She admits, fully expecting the distraction to cost him. It doesn’t. He jerks his head to look at her, but even that is planned in the split second it takes him; a fist goes sailing over his head by the scantest of margins.He doesn’t look concerned at all.His confidence is thrilling.
