History[edit]
The company was founded in 1965 by Gene Feist, Michael Fried and Elizabeth Owens and now operates five theatres, all in Manhattan: the American Airlines Theatre (for classic Broadway plays and musicals); Studio 54 (for Broadway musicals and special events); the Stephen Sondheim Theatre (a new theater that incorporates the original facade of the historical Henry Miller Theatre);[1] the Off-Broadway Laura Pels Theatre (for new works by established playwrights); and the Roundabout Underground Black Box Theatre (for new work of emerging writers and directors). The latter two theatres are located in the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theatre (the former American Place Theatre).[2][3] The Center was developed, with financial support from the Steinbergs, "to support its artistic mission of fostering emerging talent in playwriting, performance, and stagecraft."[4]
Previously, Roundabout also occupied 44 Union Square.[5]
