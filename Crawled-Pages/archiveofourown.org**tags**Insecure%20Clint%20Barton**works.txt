      “You know Jasper’s not going to go for it,” Clint warned, turning a specimen over in his hands and peering down at it.“Like that’s going to stop me.” Phil was perched on the edge of the lab table, feet dangling.Clint glanced up at him, the corner of his mouth curling upward. “Would it kill you to go easy on him? You know he’s in a rough patch right now, what with--”“The Melinda thing, yeah.” He drummed his heels against the solid wood base of the table.

And he maybe hallucinates seeing a dead man, only to find out he didn't!  Why can't the team trust Clint to know that the archer knows what he is doing?  Thankfully, JARVIS is on Clint's side and will do all he can to help.  Even if it has a small chance of endangering the archer and the other Avengers.

    Summary
      (Prompt from @purpleli93) Established Clint/Phil, before captain America was found. Then they find captain America, Clint thinks he is gonna loose Phil (even though Phil is madly in love with Clint, he considers him “the one”) to captain so tries to enjoy the time they have left and looks at Steve wishing he could be him so Phil could love him forever, but Phil catches those glimpses Clint gives captain America and thinks Clint is falling in love with Steve. Phil thinks it makes sense, since Steve is younger, handsome, kind, etc. So both wait until the other wants to break up until one can’t take the wait anymore and explodes in angst then they talk and happy ending!(I saw this prompt and couldn’t help myself from hijacking it :P.)(PS: It kinda ran away from me .It was supposed to be a short fic but now it seems to want to expand itself into a long fic. I am going to post it in parts as I finish writing them. )

    Summary
      It was an article for Variety that read: HAWKEYE AND THE WINTER SOLDIER’S SECRET ROMANCE. Clint spit coffee everywhere, as he’d unfortunately taken a sip just before reading that. He coughed, swallowing some down wrong even as he spit out the rest, and immediately Bucky was there, patting his back with strong thumps. Clint gulped down air before saying, “Wait, what the fuck?” OR 5 times Bucky "saves" Clint, and 1 time Clint saves Bucky.

      “It’s okay,” Clint says to Bucky in a breathy whisper. It’s not okay, but what else is he supposed to say?I love you,  is what he wants to say.Natasha crosses the room to sit on Clint’s other side, grasping his knee. “Do not be ashamed of who you are, we love you the same now as we did before.”
  But still not the way I wish you would.

    Summary
      Clint and Phil have been a family for a long time, but now that they have adopted their baby girl, everything changed.a.k.a That fic that caused the author to google "How the fuck do babies work"*+~(...)"Hey Honey, please stop crying. I might just join in at this point."Emma, unimpressed by her Daddy's plead, is still hiccuping on sobs and clenches his shirt in her little fists. Clint keeps walking, humming, and gently caressing her dark brown hair in an attempt to soothe her. He really wishes Phil was here. He's got experience with babies, having several nieces and nephews, an seemingly infinite amount of patience and maybe a better idea of how to calm little humans who are overwhelmed and upset. Because Clint clearly can't sort it out right now.(...)
