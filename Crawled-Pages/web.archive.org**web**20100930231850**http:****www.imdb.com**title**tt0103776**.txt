PicturesSee more »Fun Stuff  Trivia:The first script draft of Batman Returns was intended to be a direct-sequel to the previous film. As a result, sub plots and continuity from the first film that would have been addressed included gift shops selling fragments of the destroyed Bat-Wing, further revelations into the past of the now deceased Jack Napier AKA Joker, and even Bruce Wayne proposing to Vicki Vale by the end of the film. However, Tim Burton was uncomfortable in making a direct sequel and as a result, the script was rewritten. However, several plot elements from the original script did make it into the final draft. This included the Penguin and Catwoman's alliance, their framing of Batman, and the Dark Knight's escape via Bat-Glider. Further elements even made their way into the third film, Batman Forever (1995), most notably the storming of Wayne Manor and the Batcave.See more » Goofs:Continuity: In the scene where the Penguin is speaking to Max Shreck in his underground Lair, the Penguin's necktie disappears and reappears several times.See more » Quotes:[first lines] Happy Woman:Merry Christmas!

A sequel worthy of an excellent movie!, 19 September 2002
Author:

Ah, Batman Returns, is it possible to have a sequel to be almost as
good as the original? With Batman Returns, it came pretty close! We
have terrific actors and a great plot with the dark knight and two new
villains, Catwoman and The Penguin. We have Michael Keaton back as
Batman and he's still awesome than ever. Michelle Pfieffer, the perfect
choice for Catwoman and was perfectly cast into place. As much as I
love and is such an incredible actress Annette Benning, she couldn't
have been Catwoman, she doesn't really have the look. Danny DeVito, who
could have imagined him as The Penguin? He was just great and
terrifying! Batman returns with a more loving community of Gotham City, they are
celebrating Christmas time with, Max Shrek played by a creepy
Christopher Walken. The perfect villain who mistreats his lovely
secretary, Selina who happens to hear too much at his office causing
him to push her out the window in hopes that she dies and will never
reveal the information of knowing the Penguin and the attempt to make
him loved in Gotham. When she survives and is awakened by cats, she
wants revenge and is ready to go at it with her cats! But there is also
another active villain, The Penguin who is in search of his parents
that abandoned him and now he is looking to be the new mayor of Gotham
City! Can Batman be able to stop both super villains from creating
their hanous acts and stop the mayor from destroying the city as well?You'll have to see! Batman Returns is just as good as the original
Batman, despite the first one remaining the true classic, this one
still takes you for a ride. And come on, I mean we've got Michelle in
leather! Her classic moment of just meeting Batman and The Penguin
"Meow" is classic! There are memorable characters, lines, and sets!
You'll have a blast! Trust me! 9/10
