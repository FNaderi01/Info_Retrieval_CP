Homer Peter Snyder (December 6, 1863 – December 30, 1937) was a United States Representative from New York.
Biography[edit]
Born in Amsterdam, Montgomery County, New York, he attended the common schools and was employed in various capacities in knitting mills until 1887. He moved to Little Falls in 1887 and continued employment in knitting mills; he engaged in the manufacture of knitting machinery in 1890 and, later, of bicycles and other wheeled vehicles. He was director and vice president of the Little Falls National Bank and served one term as school commissioner in 1895 and two terms as fire and police commissioner of Little Falls in 1910 and 1911. He was an unsuccessful candidate for election in 1912 to the Sixty-third Congress, and was elected as a Republican to the Sixty-fourth and to the four succeeding Congresses, holding office from March 4, 1915 to March 3, 1925. He was chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs (Sixty-sixth through Sixty-eighth Congresses) and a member of the Committee on World War Veterans' Legislation (Sixty-eighth Congress).  On the former committee, his most significant achievement was sponsoring the landmark Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 (also called the Snyder Act), which granted citizenship to all of the United States' Indian population.
Snyder was a delegate to the Republican National Conventions in 1916 and 1920 and was not a candidate for reelection in 1924. He resumed his former manufacturing pursuits and in 1937 died in Little Falls; interment was in the Church Street Cemetery.
