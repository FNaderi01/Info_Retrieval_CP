    Summary
      While listening to the They Might Be Giants album The Else on shuffle, I found myself having one inspiration after another, so a sort of variation on that shuffle drabbles theme seemed inevitable.1. The Mesopotamians, Sith afterlife, featuring characters from Darth Bane: Path Of Destruction2. The Shadow Government, a Chiss in NYC, with the 1971 movie that shares the band's name3. Take Out The Trash, Mother and small son take their leave from Cosinga, changing history4. With the Dark, Ariana is more than she seems...and even more to come
