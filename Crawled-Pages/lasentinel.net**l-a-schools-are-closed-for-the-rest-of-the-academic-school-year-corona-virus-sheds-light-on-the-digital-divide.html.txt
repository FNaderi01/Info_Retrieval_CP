Thursday, April 2. The L.A. County Office of Education disclosed emergency protocols that are taking place within the Los Angeles school system. Based on the recommendation from the California State Governor, academic curriculum will remain virtually achievable for the remainder of the school year. The L.A. Office County of Education shared how this will affect the 80 school districts that are in the Los Angeles region. The Emergency Operation Center recognized the stress that will contribute to parents and care givers who are now responsible for facilitating a virtual hub of education for their child. Director of Public Health shared the most recent data surrounding COVID-19.
California Governor, Gavin Newsom announced an agreement on Wednesday; schools across California will remain closed as the nation combats the COVID-19 pandemic. In wake of the spread of the Corona Virus, closing the digital divide has been escalated to a top priority, as virtual classes become the only access to continual learning for students. Superintendent of the L.A. County Office of Education, Debra Duardo reviewed the action Los Angeles is taking in light of the Governor’s suggestion. Wednesday, Duardo announced the physical closure of schools for the remainder of the academic year. Debra stated, “This decision aligns with Governor Gavin Newsom’s and state superintendent Tony Thurmond’s statement, that students will not be returning to school this year.”

Ferrer shared on April 2. there were 13 additional deaths, 12 of these individuals were between the ages of 65 and over, with underlining health conditions.

There are 534 new COVID-19 reports, in summary there is a total amount of 4,045 cases in the Los Angeles region.

Of these new cases, 9 additional individuals who have tested positive are unsheltered. Approximately 22% of those infected with COVID-19 are hospitalized at some point.

Debra Duardo declared that learning will continue. Under the agreement of the California State Governor, all pay benefits will be upheld for academic faculty during the transition to virtual learning. Meals and other necessary resources will be provided to students as they begin their lessons from home. Newsom shared that there is a collaboration with google to provide Chromebook and 100,000 hotspots for families living in rural areas. Students receiving this aid, will obtain free internet access. The agreement is set in place to minimize the effects of school closures and supply a framework that set a practical virtual system for distant learning.
