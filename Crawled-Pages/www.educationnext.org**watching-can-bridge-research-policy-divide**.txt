On June 15, 2017 at 10 am, the Fordham Institute will host a discussion about why education research and education policy are often disconnected and what can be done to fix this.
As the event page explains
Yet when it comes to informing the actual design and implementation of sound policies, from charter schooling to pre-school expansion to statewide accountability systems and much else, today’s research base remains quite limited. We have evidence, for example, on whether school choice “works”—but not much solid evidence about which policy levers to pull to make it work better at scale. Likewise, we know that “teachers matter”—but aren’t quite sure how to translate that finding into smart state policies around teacher preparation, evaluation, and much else. How might this gap be narrowed?
