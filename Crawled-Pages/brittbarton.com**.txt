				We Are Makers
				Britt Barton is a print, digital, and interactive creative firm.
We make ideas into tangible things: products to hold in your hands, catch your attention on the street, or watch on a screen. We also make them less complicated and affordable.
Our work is to assure you get the guidance, savvy insights, and the results you want.
Reach out. We want you to know the difference we make.
				Connections
				We make sure our clients connect their ideas in a way that results in solid, digital, or conceptual products.  Here are a few things we’ve just completed.
				Make Contact
				Some of our clients have never pushed their ideas out into the world.
Some of our clients have, and they want to create more.
So, we step in. We guide you.
We can because we’ve made your trek many times before.
				Work			Britt Barton is a creative firm that makes the process of creating ideas and objects understandable, achievable, and affordable.
