      The Seattle Schooners score the biggest coup in modern hockey history - on the same day they announce trades with the LV Aces and Providence Falconers. It's the Trade of the Century, nobody knew it was happening, not even Jack and Kent. Jack's newly single, Kent's the king of NDA and dash. Now they've got to reperfect their patented no-look one timer, deal with the years in between, and inconvenient feelings.  Shouldn't they be past this already?Written by PoliticallyObsessedScholar and read by Annapods.

    Summary
      It hadn't bothered Stiles before, not until the invader prodded at the holes in his memory and laughed. It had laughed so hard the bandages started to peel from its face."Oh, this explains everything," It said as it turned its dead eyes on Stiles "I'm going to enjoy this."

Blood and Violence
    Summary
      The first time Stile’s saw a dead man walking he was three and the man was his grandfather. They were visiting the family and, out of all the people in the room, his grandfather was the only one without color. When Stile’s pointed it out they had laughed uproariously, ruthlessly teasing his grandfather on his grey hair and wrinkles. When Stile’s tried to explain that all of the man was gray, his mother had shushed him.A week later the man was dead.  (Stiles has never been the average child, much the dismay of his teachers. But he'd never thought anyone but his mother would ever know just how weird he actually was. But apparently interfering in attempted mass murders was not a good way to keep your crazy under cover. Who knew, right?)

    Summary
      "Beware of the strangers that lurk around you. They are dangerous." It's a parent's favorite thing to say. It's one of those things ingrained into the brain of every young kid, and it usually follows them all the way to adulthood, can even follow them to the grave. But Stiles knows that it's never the strangers you have to worry about.
It's the people you're closest to that have the capacity to hurt you the most.
- 
He listened to Chris yelling through the bug in the warehouse, listened to a dangerous growl rip from Derek's chest, listened to Peter scream for his nephew. Stiles watched Scott lift his hand, watched his claws fly towards Derek's bared throat... He pulled the trigger without even realizing what was happening. He stared through his scope, breathless, for as long as it took for Scott's body slump to the ground, motionless, until it finally set in. He had just killed his best friend. His brother.
He rolled away from his sniper and screamed.
