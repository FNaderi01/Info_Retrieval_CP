Fics for 2018 # 006 ~ First Love; Hello... GoodbyeDec. 25th, 2018 02:38 am
    TITLE: First Love; Hello... Goodbye       AUTHOR: kerk_hiraeth     FANDOM: Degrassi: The Next Generation (post-S12 for Fiona; S14 for Imogen);     LENGTH: 250;     CHARACTER(S): Fiona Coyne; Imogen Moreno; Laura Coyne; OC;     A/N: This was written to fill a prompt @  femslash100 ~ Any: Any/Any - parting is such sweet sorrow for doctorkaitlyn (which is also a reminder that I have to do something to get overmy embarrasment at my phobia about forms and accept offered help; thus enabling me to move stories onto kerk_hiraeth ).             I have no idea whether they are a fan of Degrassi though, being from Ontario, I Imagine they are aware of it. I have been aware of the show since news, probably, of it's re-incarnation; named above, being on the way.            Fiona and Imogen weren't even the first couple that attracted my attention, though Fiona Coyne; involved at the time of the scene I first saw in a domestic abuse and alcoholism storyline, was the first named character I ever saw (I didn't know at the time she was also coming out).           Can't recall whether it was while looking for Zoe/Rasha videos or, more likely, Adam/Becky ones, but the first Fiona/Imogen vid I saw was of their break up. I do know that from the moment I saw the request I had the image of that break up, and the expression on the characters faces; quite vivid in my mind. At first I struggled to capture it, until I realised I was writing from the wrong character's perspective; once that was corrected the story was written very quickly.              Imogen Moreno slipped quietly into a pew; eyes catching those of the Mother of her first love as she led her daughter down the aisle.      Fiona Coyne; soon to be Chang, could only see the woman she was here to wed. Imogen glanced down, not quite feeling that sweet sorrow, but certainly a bittersweet sense memory of when those eyes had looked at her that way; taking in, as her own were at the same moment, the face she might never see again.      Ironic that it had been she who was hard to track down; Fiona who was settling down in one place; albeit to a French speaking veteran, and newly Canadian, very mixed race, mother of a model Fiona had dressed for a small movie role.      Pure chance that had led her to take a date to the only movie theater in Ohio that was showing that film, so she could see what everyone else probably thought was a very cryptic message in the end titles.      One ditched date; two taxis, a plane and a train later and she was here; having called, as it turned out Fiona's Mom, just in time to see her first love marry another.      As she watched Fiona share her vows with her new wife, Imogen felt pangs, but no regrets; her decision back then had been the right one. She smiled; so much catching up; tearful joy and sweet sorrow at another, hopefully less permanent, parting, to do.      Until then...       JULIET      Sweet, so would I. Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing. Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow.       William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet; Act Two, Scene Two.       kerk hiraeth
