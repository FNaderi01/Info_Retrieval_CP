    Summary
      Draco's always been drawn to Hermione in some way, he has for years and can't explain. It'd be easier if he could just get a moment alone with her to see why, but she's never alone!At the Yule Ball, Draco finally has a moment with Hermione and they share that time coming to a "truce". A battle of brains starts between the two as they form a friendly rivalry to excel in their classes. What started as a "make Weasley jealous" game becomes something more, quickly, and with far reaching consequences.With Harry's Triwizard Tournament taking much of the spotlight, and Hermione acting strangely with Malfoy, Ron's jealousy starts manifesting in ugly ways, until it causes a break in school tradition so shocking that people will speak of it for ages to come.A story where Draco finds his redemption at the pivotal moment, deciding that helping keep Harry alive to prevent the resurrection of Voldemort is more important than bitter school rivalries.

    Summary
      During the Battle at the Ministry of Magic, Hermione is killed. But the end is not always the end. Perhaps it sometimes places you back at your beginnings, or nudges you along to beyond the final moments. But sometimes, it tears out the pages of the book and starts anew. Sometimes it thrusts you into a new life, with a new family and friends, with no memories of the last. Perhaps, though, that was always what you were meant to be."Then suddenly, the floating stopped. Hermione started to fall-quickly. She flailed her arms around to try to slow her rapid descent, grabbing for her wand, for something to hold onto but there was nothing, which was just as frightening as the fall itself. Then, just as suddenly as the fall had started, it stopped, and her eyes flew open to the sound of a girl's laughter."

    Summary
      Harriet had always been a bit odd. Between talking to Snakes and spiders, a demon with a twisted smile and sadistic sense of humor as her only childhood friend, and a lightning shaped scar that ran through her left eye, there wasn't much about her that could be called normal.Not that she minded really, normal sounded dreadfully boring to her anyways. Plus Shin would pout for a week if she said otherwise, and no one came out of that sane.Now she just had to find a way to keep the easily bored lunatic from causing trouble. Hogwarts really did make her life complicated these days.

    Summary
      Hermione Granger is not your typical muggle-born student. Her first day in the wizarding world finds her catching the attention of one Lucius Malfoy. He makes a split second decision to take her under his wing and educate her on all things wizarding world which sets off a chain of events on its own with the immediate effect being Hermione sorted into Slytherin House at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. (This is a rewrite of The Slytherin Mudblood because I didn’t enjoy how I was writing it and ended up trapping myself in writer’s block).
Disclaimer: As much as I would like to be able to take credit for the amazing literature that is Harry Potter, that credit belongs to the wonderful J.K.Rowling. The only aspect of my story that is my own is the plotline. I have taken direct dialogue from the Harry Potter series written by J.K.R. and would appreciate not being flagged for copyright violations/plagiarism. Thank you and enjoy!
***As of March 26, 2018 Lily Moon will be a Gryffindor due to it leading to an uneven distribution of Hermione's year-mates amongst the four houses only discovered at this moment in time. (plus she probably would have lead to a massive plot hole at some point).***

As they grow into their power, the whispers that surround them get thicker.They should enjoy the freedom of the summer while it lasts, because the Grim stalks at every step, and not even a Seer can tell just what that means for the Twins.

    Summary
      Zeitreise-Fanfiction, in der Hermine aus Versehen im Jahr 1944, zur Schulzeit von Voldemort, landet. Zusammen mit dem damals jungen Dumbledore arbeitet sie daran, wieder in die Zukunft zurückkehren zu können - und lernt nebenbei interessante Dinge über Menschen, die sie für Monster gehalten hat. Kann es ihr gelingen, in der Vergangenheit die Zukunft zu retten?Wir begleiten Hermine auf ihrer überraschenden Reise zurück ins Jahr 1944. Dank eines jungen Dumbledore akzeptiert sie schnell, dass sie hier eine Mission zu erfüllen hat, und sie weiß einfach, dass es mit Tom Riddle zusammenhängt. Doch je näher sie ihm kommt, umso stärker spürt sie, dass er ihr auf mehr als einer Ebene gefährlich werden kann. Ihre Beziehung zu ihm wird zunehmend komplizierter, da nicht mehr alleine Hass und Abneigung ihre Gefühle für ihn bestimmen. Geschickt gräbt er tief verborgene Emotionen in ihr aus, um sie zu seinen Gunsten zu manipulieren. Während die Schwärze Hermine zu verschlingen droht, merkt jedoch auch Tom, dass nicht alles im Leben so läuft, wie geplant ...
