Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans is a base of the United States military located in Belle Chasse, unincorporated Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, United States.[2] NAS JRB New Orleans is home to a Navy Reserve strike fighter squadron and a fleet logistics support squadron, the 159th Fighter Wing (159 FW) of the Louisiana Air National Guard, Coast Guard Air Station New Orleans, a detachment of a Marine Corps Reserve light helicopter attack squadron, as well as other US Navy &amp; US Army activities. The base has a 24/7 operating schedule to support both the 159 FW's NORAD air sovereignty/homeland defense requirements and for Coast Guard Air Station New Orleans search and rescue/maritime law enforcement/port security missions. It contains a military airport known as Alvin Callender Field (IATA: NBG, ICAO: KNBG, FAA LID: NBG) which is located three nautical miles (6 km) south of the central business district of New Orleans.[1] The base's predecessor, NAS New Orleans, occupied the current location of the University of New Orleans's principal campus until 1957.
