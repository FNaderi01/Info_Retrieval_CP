George S. Clinton scores Mike Myers’ The Love Guru
Posted on May 24, 2008 by Dan Goldwasser
Recently, the score to the new Mike Myers comedy The Love Guru was recorded at the  Eastwood Scoring Stage at Warner Brothers, in Burbank, CA.  Composed by George S. Clinton (Austin Powers), the score featured an  80-piece orchestra, and it made sure to take advantage of that size.

Conducting the Hollywood Studio Symphony himself, Clinton’s score is  melodic and playful, but also plays it seriously – especially during the  comedic parts.  Orchestrators Suzie  Katayama and Rick Giovinazzo were in the booth to provide feedback, along with  scoring mixer Steve Kempster and music editor Mike Flicker.  Fellow music editor Matt Friedman was on the  stage running the click-track.
