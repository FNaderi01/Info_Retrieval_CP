    Summary
      Being declared ‘off-limits’ by a tenko child had been funny at first—for about a month. Ryuzo amused himself by sneaking up on Jin and pulling the zenko into playful embraces, only for Jin to yelp, blush, fluff up in horror and escape by any means necessary. One memorable incident involved Jin jumping into a lake and swimming off, while Ryuzo laughed on the viewing pavilion until he cried.

    Summary
      Ryuzo bit his tongue at the sound of sobbing drifting through the dark trees, goosebumps pricking up his arm. As he hissed and swore under his breath, the weeping stopped, then picked up again as soft gasps. A ghost? Sounded like a child—but weren’t zashiki-warashi meant to be mischievous rather than malicious? Ryuzo was tempted to run home, but the knowledge that he’d have to face his older brother Daijiro’s teasing for weeks rooted him on the spot. He grit his teeth and forced himself to take a step forward, hands clenched. For all he knew, this was one of Daijiro’s elaborate pranks.

    Summary
      Driven to his knees, his katana sent spinning across the floor, Ryuzo blew out a ragged breath between gritted teeth and waited for the end. Beyond the open shoji doors that led to the courtyard, under a starless sky, the air was thick with the sounds of people vomiting and screaming. Ryuzo bit down the words on his tongue, waiting. There was nothing left to say. The snarling black mask Jin wore looked far less intimidating than the rage in his eyes as he walked closer, a bestial fury that Ryuzo had never seen Jin wear. Not even during that last disastrous ‘friendly’ duel between them. Not when they’d raided Mongol camps together. It tore loose Ryuzo’s brief determination to keep his peace. “Jin. I’m sorry.”

    Summary
      Chen Yue let out a loud snort, even as Wang Zhi said, “I didn’t need your help.” “I did have something to discuss,” Chen Yue said, dipping his head. The gesture would have appeared shy had they been around the same size, but Chen Yue was big even for a blue, his tail looping out of sight into the clouds. The lowered head merely brought him closer to Wang Zhi’s eye level.“What happened?” Wang Zhi asked, cocking his head. “I hear you’ve been asking around the Palace for me.”“Ah. Yes.” Chen Yue sounded embarrassed, the sails on his back flattening against his spine. “I haven’t been back here for a long time. I got lost.”

    Summary
      Ryuzo stifled a yawn and checked his phone as he waited with the rest of the saikō-komon for a one-on-one audience with their new, mysterious oyabun. As he slouched down further over the uncomfortable plastic chair, Kosei nudged him in the ankle. “Sit up,” Kosei muttered, low enough that only Ryuzo could catch it. “Don’t look so bored.” “He’s taking his time,” Ryuzo grumbled, though he obligingly sat back up. “Who is this guy, anyway? I thought you were next in line.”

    Summary
      These differences between British and American terminology and culture below are all ones I have seen in Sherlock fic or that are likely to come up in Sherlock fic. It is not exhaustive and I know that I will think of or spot at least 10 more as soon as I post this, but it is a start.  If you have read fic set in America written by a Brit you will know that these things jar and spoil the flow quite a lot, so here you go.
