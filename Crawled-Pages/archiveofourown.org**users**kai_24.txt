    Summary
      Lan Wangji finally started piecing together what Nie Huaisang had said to what he could see happening. Wen Tech’s decision to include the media into the elaborate and ostentatious funeral was at the least strange, and at the most unheard of in such an elite corporate family. The red colours of the Wens were still present despite the white dress common at such events. Security was stationed everywhere, and mingling among the numerous guests, eyes vigilant and darting every which way. Suddenly Huaisang’s wild theories were much more real-sounding than a car accident somehow warranting a small army to guard the place. Someone may have killed Wen Chao. The Wens were afraid, because evidently, no one knew who had done it. And they expected whomever it was, to show their face here. ----Or, the Winter Soldier AU no one asked for but came to me in a moment of great pain (stomach ache)

    Summary
      Wei Wuxian had never been adopted by the Jiang family. He'd grown up in and out of orphanages, foster homes, until he graduates and becomes a caretaker in his local homeless community. Until he's arrested for stealing food and assaulting an officer.When Lan Wangji, his fated mate, an alpha attorney, tells him that he'll be released by marrying him, he doesn't take the opportunity. He doesn't remember him and he doesn't want his pity.

    Summary
      “Red. Definitely red.”“Jiejie, of course we’re going with red but don’t you think a suit will fit them more?”“Aiya, Meimei. Red suits will be too much, ah!” Xiao Mama says, leaning back in her seat. “My ZhanZhan is always a traditional boy at heart so a changsan will fit him more. I’m sure your YiBo will also look dashing in a matching set. What do you think, Meimei? I know this tailor at home--”“No need ah. They will get married in the city so it will be too troublesome if the tailor is in your hometown. Leave it to Meimei.” Wang Mama says as she nods her head firmly.
