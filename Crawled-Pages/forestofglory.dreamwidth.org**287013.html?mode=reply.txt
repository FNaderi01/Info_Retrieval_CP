Watching the MoonOct. 8th, 2020 10:24 am
forestofgloryMy kid's remote kindergarten class is doing a unit on the moon. All of us adults think this is great. As part of the unit we are supposed to go look at the moon every night. So, I have learned that its very hard to see the moon from our house most nights. I was vaguely aware that I didn't see the moon very often, but looking for it nightly has made it very clear how hard it is to see the moon. We live in a bit of a canyon with lots of trees around so there's just not a lot of clear sky. For a bit we could see the moon if we walked down the street a bit to a clearer spot but now its rising latter and it doesn't get visible before bedtime. (We also had to skip a few days due to smoke)The moon unit is timed around the mid-autumn festival, which was last Thursday. We had a little family celebration. After dinner we went for a drive to try and see the full moon. However it was either to early or too smokey because we couldn't find it. So that was disappointing. After failing to find the moon we came home and had an indoor picnic sitting on a blanket on the floor. R had been to the Chinese bakery earlier that week and brought home six mooncakes each a different flavor. So we had one of those, lotus paste with salted egg because that was the most traditional, and some chocolate. Then we put the kid to bed. Did any of you observe the min-autumn festival? What did you do?
