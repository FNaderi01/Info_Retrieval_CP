                Made by gemini-moon.net!Hi! My name is Merry and I'm 20. This is sort of what I call my 'melancholic journal'.  I will be posting things from Tumblr, realizations, and melancholy stuff here. I might even make a happy post every once and a while. ;) Being melancholy also helps me be creative for some reason, so maybe you'll see some of that here. If you want to be my friend, please comment on the FO post. :) I will not add everybody. -MerryMade by me!
