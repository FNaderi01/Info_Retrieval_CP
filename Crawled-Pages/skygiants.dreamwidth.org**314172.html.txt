skygiantsIf you follow me on Twitter you've already gotten spammed with this, but I'm sorry this is going on every social media platform I own:LES MIS 2D FIGHTER COMPUTER GAMEFeaturing player characters such as Enjolras, Eponine, Jean Valjean, and ROBOJEAN.  Why?  WHY NOT.My favorite part is when Marius uses his special move to summon an army of undead skeletal revolutionaries to defeat the police.(That's not even true, my favorite part is when Eponine dramatically whisks away her cross-dressing jacket right before starting battle.  BUT THE UNDEAD REVOLUTIONARIES ARE ALSO GOOD.)YOU'RE WELCOME

Late Monday night, enormous sparkles were spotted rising from the Wallingford neighborhood of Seattle.  The cause is being investigated.

I have a burning question for you: why is Marius dressed like Spike Spiegel? Also, I did not know he kicked so much ass. Really.
