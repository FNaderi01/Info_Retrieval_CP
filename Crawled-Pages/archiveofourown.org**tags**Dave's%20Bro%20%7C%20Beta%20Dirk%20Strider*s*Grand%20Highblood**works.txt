    Summary
      Dirk "Bro" Strider is a lot of things.  A father, a leader, head of a rebellion - and now, apparently, a slave to the most terrifying troll ever to grace Earth.Kurloz Makara, The Grand Motherfuckin Highblood, is also a lot of things.  When "monster" doesn't fit that list, Bro is confused and a little terrified.  How can he kill someone who doesn't deserve to die?  And how can his rebellion survive when their leader is a traitor?

    Summary
  	“Hello Mr. Strider I am calling on behalf of HS Adult Video Corporation. As you may know HS is celebrating its thirtieth anniversary this year and is commemorating the occasion with a special series of films whose actors and scenarios will be chosen by the fans themselves. We are contacting you to see if you would consider participating in this event.” 
His legion of fans have paired him with Kurloz Makara a.k.a. The Grand Highblood, former faux-snuff film star and founding member of the horrorcore rap group The Subjugglators.
The fans in their infinite wisdom have also voted on the scenario and they want a touch of domestic fluff with their smut.
Being a legendary porn star is hard and Bro Strider understands that all too well.

    Summary
      The Signless went from an unknown mutant to a martyr to a messiah to a twenty year old pre-law college student. Starting a movement that would alter Alternian history forever is easy, resisting the constant urge to kill Kankri is hard, and figuring out relationships is a task of Sisyphean proportions.
