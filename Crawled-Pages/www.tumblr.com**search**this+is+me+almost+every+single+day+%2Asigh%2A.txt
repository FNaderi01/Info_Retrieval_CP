            In the Spotlight        Fandom: Marvel (Celebrity AU)Pairing: Chubby!Bucky x Gender Neutral!ReaderAs requested by anonymous: celebrity au with chubby bucky
Originally posted by chillingbucky“Y/N! Y/N, look over here!”“Y/N, can you tell us about your relationship with Bucky Barnes?”“Yeah, Y/N! What’s someone like you doing with some guy like him?!”The paparazzi continued to badger you with questions as you made your way to your awaiting car. When your head of security, Happy, opened the door, you promptly slid in, the door shutting behind you. You were finally able to let out a sigh as you pulled off your glasses and slid back the hood of your sweatshirt. Sitting beside you was your boyfriend, Bucky Barnes. He looked upset, probably because he heard the questions the paps were throwing your way. He didn’t like how they made him feel so small.  Keep reading

            hey bucky, | bucky barnes        Summary : you write short letters for your ex-boyfriend everyday and give it to him through his friend.Words count : 1.5kp.s : the day counts after they broke upDay 1Hey Bucky…how was
work today? Did you got any mission? You must be really tired. Don’t forget to
take some rest, okay? If you forgot, your vitamin is on the shelf in the
bathroom. Don’t forget to take one every night, yeah? I love you.Day 2Hey Bucky…Today was
really cold. But i bet you didn’t feel anything, am i right? I didn’t go
anywhere today, i stuck in my blanket. I almost cry because it was so cold. You
know how my body reacts with cold, right? I wish you were here, hugging me,
Buck. I know you will hate me even more after this, but i miss you..Day 3Hey Bucky…Steve came
to my house today, he said that you are sick. I know you want to save people’s
life, but you gotta take care of yourself too, sweetheart. I told Steve to make
that potato soup you like so much, usually it will make you feel better. I hope
it still does. Please be healthy, i love you..Day 4Hey Bucky…my heart
hurts so bad this morning, i almost faint. But you said i have to be strong,
because you’re not gonna be with me the whole time. Which is right. You are
kinda send me a code that you’re gonna leave me by that sentence right? I get
it now. Its okay, Buck, maybe i am boring or annoying. Its your choice to
choose. I love you.Day 8Hey Bucky…I’ve been
really-really sick for the past 4 days, its been really cold too. I didn’t
write you any letter, i miss talking to you so much. I could barely move. Thank
god Steve came or else i will die. Or maybe i will? I hope you are having a
good day, Buck. You know i love you so much, i will always do.Day 12“Hey Steve? Where have you been?” Bucky stood up from the
couch and checking out Steve’s hand, wondering if he is holding any letter from
you.“She hasn’t eat for the past four days, Buck. She only drink
a glass of water. Please think about this again. You don’t have to do this. You
make her suffering”  said Steve, sitting
on the couch.Bucky holding his tears back, its because of his stubborn
ass trying to protect you by hurting you the most. Bucky hates himself more
than anything. He doubt he can fix this. “I don’t know, pal. Maybe she just
need time? I don’t know. I can’t hurt her anymore”“But you are hurting her worse, Buck!” Bucky’s heart almost
fell when Steve screamed at him. Steve’s face is red from anger. He shook his
head, “i’m sorry, but you should see her, Buck. I’m begging you. She will die
if you keep letting her like this. I can’t go there every single day, i got
missions to do”Bucky wipe his tears away, “i don’t understand what i was
thinking, Steve. I fucking hate myself so much she doesn’t deserve me. Just
find her a new guy” Bucky cried covering his face with both of his palms.Steve sighed, he hugged his best pal and let him cried to
his shoulder. “Don’t say that. Yes, you did something really terrible but it
doesn’t mean you can’t fix it. Just go to her tomorrow morning, take care of
her. Her temper is really high today”Hearing his favourite girl situation because of him, Bucky
cried harder, wanting to kill himself for hurting you more than he expect. “I’m
scared, Steve..”Steve patted Bucky’s back, “its okay, pal. Go get some rest,
tomorrow will be colder. Bring more blanket for Y/N tomorrow” Steve pulled
himself from Bucky and go to his room. Bucky sighed, wiping his tears, thinking
what should he say tomorrow.Day 13Bucky unlock your apartment with Steve’s keys and pushing
the door quietly, not wanting to surprise you. Bucky took a deep long breath,
getting ready to say everything he planned the night before.“Steve?”That’s it. Bucky’s tears just fall out of nowhere and he
tried his best to wipe his tears with the back of his hand. Both of his hands
are full with blankets and food for you.Bucky heard a really slow footsteps approaching him, Bucky
hold his breath before he saw you, his favourite girl in the world standing
with blanket around your body, shivering. You gasped, and rubbed your eyes, to
make sure if its really Bucky.“B—..Bucky?”“Yes baby, its me..” “Oh my god,” you just ran to his body, not caring about your
ache body anymore. You hugged Bucky, letting the blanket fall from your body.
Bucky hugged you as tight as he could, making sure you’re not cold. Tears fell
from his eyes, he buried his face to your neck, take a really long breath.“Hey Bucky..”“I am so sorry, Y/N. I am so fucking sorry, i regret
everything i did and i said. I hate myself so fucking much Y/N you have no
idea. I’m so sorry baby i didn’t mean to hurt you i’m such an asshole i don’t
deserve you—..”“Bucky..”Bucky shake his head, not wanting you to comment anything.
“I’m so sorry Y/N, its really okay if you don’t forgive me. I hurt you so much
i deserve nothing but hate from you. Please hate me, hurt me, do whatever you
want. I know you are disappointed at me and i just—..”“Bucky, stop. Please..”You pulled herself from Bucky, shivering from the
temperature. But you blew it off and stare at Bucky’s blue eyes. They didn’t
look as bright as you remember, his under eyes looks terrible, he looks
terrible.“Bucky i don’t hate you..and i’m not disappointed at you,
not at all. Its—Its your choice, and i can’t force everything you chose, Bucky.
Its really okay..” you said, smile weakly at him. You wiped tears from his
cheeks and kiss both of his eyes.“You should hate me..”You shaking your head, disagree. “I can’t hate you, Bucky.
You are the most important person in my life, i can’t just hate you like that”Bucky cried again, “b—..but look what i did to you, Y/N.
You’re getting so much skinnier and you’re sick for the past few days. I swear
this is not my intention to hurt you”“Its okay, sweetheart. Its just a fever, it will go. May i
know the reason?” You asked, taking both of his hands and hold them tightly.“I just thought—..i just thought i don’t deserve you, at all.
You deserve someone so much better. Not me, an ex-assassin who killed lots of
people. You are just too kind for me. You take care of me so much and i can’t
do that to you everyday. I left you for missions and came back with bruises and
cut all over my body and you end up taking care of me more. I want you to have
a better life, Y/N” Bucky wipe his tears, looking at your eyes.You let tears fell from your eyes. “No baby, don’t ever
think like that. You deserve me, i deserve you. We both deserve each other and
i love you, Bucky. I don’t mind taking care of you everyday. I love doing it.
Beside i work from home, so i have more time to do anything beside work.  Why would you ever think like that,
sweetheart? We could talk about it..”Bucky kiss the back of your hand, “I know, i know doll. I’m
really sorry, i am such a fucking fool. I’m selfish”“But do you still love me?”“Oh my god, of course baby. Of course. I fucking love you
more than anything in this world. I love you till my last breath. I love you so
much, Y/N. I’m just dumb and selfish” Bucky cried. You put your hands around
his neck and pull him closer, you kiss his lips slowly, not caring about your
tears. Bucky hugged your waist and pull your body closer to his.You made out with him for a couple minutes, before you
pulled yourself to catch breath. Bucky smiled at you, “i miss you so much,
doll.”“I miss you too, Bucky. Did you read my letter?” You asked.Bucky nodded, “i read all of them, love. I hold myself not
to go here, i want you to move on. But Steve snapped at me yesterday for being
the dumbest man in the world. And here i am now. I am so sorry baby, you have
no idea how sorry i am”“It doesn’t matter. As long as you’re here, i’m okay” you
said, hugging him.Bucky kissed your head, “let me take care of you, doll. You
need lots of food” Bucky said, picking you up. You tangled both of your legs
around his waist, clutching to him.“And cuddles.” You added, smiling at him.“Yeah, and cuddles.”pls forgive the grammar im still working on itREQUEST IS OPENNN

            Sherlock Valentine's Day Challenge Day # 11        John had been on his way to pick up his suit from the dry cleaners when he’d gotten Sherlock’s text, summoning him, at once, to Baker Street. He dashed up the stairs and burst into the flat to find Sherlock pacing the room, looking rather distressed.
“What is it? What is going on?” he asked, breathless.
“I’m going to do it, I am going to propose to Y/N tonight,” he said.
“Oh?”John said, still trying to figure out why he had just run across town for this. “That’s good news.”
“No, it’s terrible news,” Sherlock said, resuming his pacing.
“Oh?” John said again.
“Yes, I haven’t gotten a clue as to what I am going to say,” he explained. “And I had hoped to get your advice, however, you only seem capable of uttering the word ‘Oh?’”
“Well, ‘will you marry me’ usually works,” John shrugged.
“Oh come now, I can’t do something as boring as that,” Sherlock sneered. “Y/N is perfection, she is everything, she is my other half–my better half. She deserves a proposal of epic magnitude.”
    “Well it sounds as if you’ve gotten it half written right there,”John pointed out. “Start with that.” Sherlock cocked his head a little and glanced up and to the right while he mulled over what John had said. 
“Y/N, you are perfection,” Sherlock started. “You are my everything. You are my better half…”
“You’ve shown me what it means to love and be loved?” John offered.
“Oh, that’s quite good, yes…” Sherlock said, a small smile crossing his lips. “You have shown me what it is to love and be loved in return. You’ve changed my life in almost every way possible…”
“… and I can’t imagine a single day without you by my side…” John continued.
“Perfect!” Sherlock exclaimed. “Then I take out the ring–”
“Wait, there is a ring?” John exclaimed.
“Of course there is a ring, John,” Sherlock said, looking at his friend as if he had lost his mind. “Haven’t you ever proposed before? It’s no good if there is no ring.”
“Right, of course, what was I thinking,” John muttered sarcastically. “Are we good here then?”
“Almost, let’s just have one more run through, shall we?” Sherlock said, looking around. “Here, you sit here and pretend to be Y/N.”
“Nope,” John said, turning to leave.
“Please, John,” Sherlock begged, “I want it to be perfect. Do it for Y/N.” John stopped in his tracks and remembered how nervous he’d been when he’d been ready to propose to Mary. He also remembered how much he had wished Sherlock had been there, to help him through the ordeal and to share in his excitement. With a sigh, he turned back and took a seat in the chair.
“Fine, let’s get this over with,” he said, placing a hand on each knee and trying not to fidget around uncomfortably. Sherlock cleared his throat.
“Y/N, you are perfection. You are my everything. You are my better half. You have shown me what it means to love and be loved in return. You have changed my life in almost every way possible and I cannot imagine a single day without you by my side…” He paused here and produced the velvet ring box from the pocket of his suit jacket. He opened the lid and held it out in front of him before slowly dropping down to one knee. “I love you more and more each day. Will you marry me?” John looked at the ring for a moment then back to Sherlock. 
“I knew it,” a voice said from the doorway. Both men snapped their heads up to see Y/N, standing in the door frame, her eyes wide, a horrified look on her face. “I knew there was something up with you two.”
“This is NOT what it looks like, I swear!” John exclaimed, jumping up. He looked back at Sherlock. “Say something!” he hissed to his friend. Again, Sherlock cleared his throat.
“Y/N… you are perfection……”

            Of Masks and Hatred pt.8 (FINALE)        A/N:
You guys read it right. This is the finale of Of Masks and Hatred where all will be revealed. But like what I said, I plan to turn this into a saga so this is just the end of the first arc. Sorry if this doesn’t meet your expectation but I did put some thought into this part. (I’m pretty proud of this part if I may say so myself).Anyway, I hope you enjoy this. I don’t know when I’ll start the Second Saga but I’ll try not to keep you guys waiting too much.Word Count: 3.8k
Warnings: mention of suicide, attempted murder, implied frame up, language“Girls, I only have one hand injured, not an entire body,” you groan in frustration before sighing as Cheryl helps you off the car while Toni grabs your things.“Don’t be such a baby, Y/N. Knowing you, you’ll break that other arm soon,” Cheryl shrugs off your complaints. She then eyes the stairs leading to the Gray Manor’s double door entrance. “Now watch your step.”You turn your gaze to Toni trying to plead help with your eyes. You even add a pout to add effect but she only smiles at you faintly before looking away. You heave another sigh out in defeat.“I only spent three days in the hospital and they treat me like I broke every single darn bone in my body,” you mumble under your breath but you hear Cheryl’s snort nonetheless.Needless to say, the normally five-second period you take in walking the stairs almost took you three minutes because Cheryl wants you to “walk carefully” which meant you had to have both feet placed in a single step before moving to another.You roll your eyes before pulling your arm away from Cheryl and grabbing your bag from Toni, thanking her in the process. You barely pushed open one of the double doors when Cheryl stepped up and pushed them for you while flashing you a smirk. For the nth time, you sigh out and Toni just pats your back in mock comfort.“See, Y/N? You need help,” Cheryl places her hand on her hip as she looks at you smugly. Not wanting to deal with her teasing, you sauntered to the stairs making them follow you. Once you reach the top, you turn to the east wing but the redhead quickly grabs your good arm.“Where are you going? Your room’s at the opposite wing,” eyebrows raised, her calculating eyes boring into yours made you bite your lip as you eye the room closest to you.“Well, Governor Atkins visited me at the hospital last night saying he had the records I’ve been wanting,” you clear your throat before meeting her eyes. Out of practice, you straighten your stance and in a continue in a calm voice. “I had Edward take them and place them at my study. I figured I’ll browse through it today.”Narrowing her eyes at you, she grips your arms a bit tighter. “Y/N Riley, are you saying that after being bed-ridden, incapacitated, confined for three days in the hospital, you’re now heading to your boring archaic ancient office just so you can read those papers?”Steeling your eyes despite the palm of your hand beginning to sweat and the presence of a small lump in your throat, you meet her eyes head on.“Yes, Cheryl. That is exactly what I’m about to do.”She rolls her eyes before crossing her arms letting you go. “Fine, do whatever you want. But we’ll be having that sleepover tonight.”You nod, internally sighing. Your eyes landing at an awkward Toni standing just behind the redhead.“Toni,” you gently call her as you flash her a small smile, noting that she smiled back at you awkwardly. “I hope you I’m not intruding with your time together…”She turns her gaze at Cheryl who’s now flashing her a hopeful look making her chuckle. “Of course not, Y/N. It’s fine. It’s not like I’m not living with her at the Thistle House. We see each other often enough.”Your eyebrow raise as she places her hand at the small of Cheryl’s back before she fully wraps an arm around the redhead’s waist before she looks at you seemingly challenging.Cheryl’s phone rings causing you to break off from your thoughts.“It’s Reggie. I’ll just take this call,” she states before turning her eyes on Toni. “TT, please keep an eye on Y/N. Make sure she doesn’t get into more trouble.”You both watch the redhead walk away. You then shrug before motioning for Toni to follow you.Lately, you’ve been noticing Toni acting weird around you. Eversince you woke up, Cheryl never left your side, and of course, with her comes Toni. You weren’t oblivious to her actions, how she seems to always have her hand on the small of Cheryl’s back, how she looks at you after she plants a kiss on Cheryl’s lips before leaving the redhead in your presence, how she falls silent when you’re in the room with them. You notice it all, but for the love of god, you couldn’t understand her jealousy. While heading to your study room, Toni herself is lost in her own sea of thoughts. The memory of Cheryl saying she loved you when they found out you were rushed to the hospital still rings through her mind. She knows she shouldn’t be jealous. Cheryl is with her and you are Cheryl’s bestfriend but there are times she couldn’t help it. Especially not when Cheryl refused to leave your side, even resorting to climbing up your hospital bed and sleeping there with you instead of going home with her at the Thistle House, only seeing her when it’s time for school. It bothered her how her dates with Cheryl would end up with the redhead ordering food to take to you. And now that you’ve been discharged, Cheryl insisted on taking you home and having a sleepover with you canceling vixen practice.She knows she shouldn’t be jealous but she’s finding it hard not to be.You take out a key and open the door, holding it open, motioning for her to come through first before you do. You dart straight to your desk at the end of the room. Her eyes scan everything, from the shelves stacked against the walls filled mostly with hardbound books, the left side of the room vacated by a small round table in between two intricately designed leather couches each fit for two, just behind it is a pair of intricately carved chairs and the dark brown desk you headed off to. She can make out a small globe in front of a few books on top of it, along with a table lamp on the opposite side. Just a meter adjacent from it is another table with a chessboard on top, two chairs opposite each other. As she scans further, her eyes land on a portrait of an almost gray-haired man regally standing wearing a dark gray suit, he stands poised with both his hands on a cane. What unnerves her is the intensity of the man’s (Y/E/C) eyes. It’s also noticeable how emphasized the black stallion crest on the cane is.“That’s my grandfather, Lucas Riley,” you speak out causing for her to shift her eyes towards you.“How do you know I’m looking at him when you’re holding that paper in front of you all this time?” she scrunches her eyebrows in confusion. You chuckle as you place the document down on top of the desk, revealing you wearing your reading glasses.“Everything in this study has been strategic. From the position of the door to the couches, the desk, and of course the portrait. It’s a play of power. Even the bookshelves,” you explain to her.“The bookshelves?” You smirk as you take in the disbelief in her tone.“Particularly, the books,” you stand up and head to the bookshelf closest to her, blindly picking a book and giving it to her.“Okay? Harry Potter book and the Philosopher’s Stone.. That’s” she drawls on as she eyes the book in her hands weirdly.“Open it,” you wave your hand dismissively as you return to your seat.She thumbs through the worn pages of the book. “Are these notes?”“Not just some notes,” you correct her. “In your hands is an almost a quarter million dollar worth first print of the first book of the first edition of the Harry Potter series. And those notes, illustrations and commentaries are written by J.K. Rowling herself.”“Did you just say almost a quarter million dollars?!” she quickly returned the book on the shelf as if her hands burned just by touching it.“Yes, that entire shelf you’re looking at and the one in the other side are both filled with rare books. Mostly first editions, some just of limited printing,” you tell her nonchalantly as you scan through a report on the Andrews &amp;Son Construction Company. “Collectors’ books mainly. The shelves on the middle are a mix of History, Philosophy, and Arts. And finally, the ones closest to me center on Psychology, Business, and Politics.”“So you spend ridiculous amounts of money for books? I get it, your family is rich and all that but quarter a million dollars for a book, and you have a lot of books that cost almost the same,” she presses her lips in a tight line trying to wrap her head on the reality of it before setting her eyes on you, raising her hands and dropping them down in frustration. “That’s just too much. Too overboard.”Hearing the rise in her voice, you cast your eyes up to look at her through the frames of your reading glasses. “Is it?” you tilt your head and stare at her. “The room where you are currently at is where every business dealing takes place. Moreover, this is the first place a Riley goes to when they want to pay a visit. The portrait exudes intimidation with those eyes; the cane a reminder of who you’re dealing with. The books near me sends signals to whoever walks in that who they’re dealing with is highly educated. The furnitures, the collectors’ books, even the carpet you’re standing on is a sign of power. Everything is symbolic.It’s not ridiculous. It is a statement.”“You rich people are so…”“Frustrating,” you finish for her. Your eyebrows raised but the slight smile on your face makes your amusement known. You lean against your chair as you watch her roll her eyes.“Arrogant, impractical, and extra,” she corrects even pointing her index finger at you with a smirk. “But frustrating works too.”You grin at her sheepishly before fully setting aside the paper you’re holding. You let out a soft chuckle causing her to look at you in bemusement.“Are you laughing at me?” she crosses her arms while narrowing her eyes at you. Instead of being intimidated, you find yourself letting out a soft laugh. “Sorry, it’s just….. I once thought of it as that way before. I kinda find it funny now that I’ve heard someone else say it. And in front of my face.”She chuckles before finally taking a seat on one of the couches. “It’s very comfortable though. This doesn’t cost a million, does it?”You smirk at her and shake your head. “Not really, just a few thousands.”You see her eyes landing on the chess set.“Who have you been playing with? Edward?” she questions you.”I can’t imagine him sitting on that chair. Maybe standing, he’s always standing, but not sitting.”“Just me,” you cleared out. “Only a Riley can play that set. It’s somewhat of a rule. One of the most ridiculous ones, I believe.”“How do you even play with yourself?” She looks at you incredulously.“Did you just ask me how I play with myself, Toni? My my… ” your grin widens as she groans.“You know what I meant!”You guffawed seeing her plop back against the couch.“Well, for your information, I make plays. Just taking note of possible moves, both offensive and defensive. Then when my grandfather visits, we play a game,” you explain making her nod in understanding. “My grandfather pushes us to the limit. Whether it’s with education, manners, or just plain problem-solving and logical reasoning through chess…. He requires us to do great.”She opens her mouth but closes it again, unable to form a response. She somehow feels the pressure on your shoulders. Taking another look at the portrait, she wonders how it is to be under the clutches of such a man.“Toni….” you smile as she shifts her gaze at you. “Thank you.”“For what?” taken aback by your mellow tone, her voice laced with curiosity, thinking she really hasn’t done anything for you.“Cheryl. Thank you for being there for her when I wasn’t,” you sent her a sad smile. She smiles back in understanding.“No need to thank me. I love her.”“Still. After hearing everything she’s been through, I hate myself for not being around,” you look down biting your lip. “After losing Elena, finding out that Cheryl’s been miserable, it weighed down on me. But seeing you with her, making her happy, and knowing how much you’ve helped her throughout the whole ordeal, it just…. I’m thankful she has you.”She nods sending you a smile. She watches you go back to your reading again. Unknown to her, your thoughts aren’t focused on what’s written on the reports.You both jump a bit as the door slams revealing a stone-faced Cheryl.Toni pulls her down beside her taking note of her girlfriend’s clenched jaw and tense shoulders.“What’s gotten your knickers in a twist?” you furrow your brows in curiosity taking note of her clenched fists.“Reggie said that Archie’s been released earlier. Can you believe it?!”“Slow down. Breathe,” you stand up from your chair and walk towards her. You then kneel in front of her taking her fist and unclenching it gently. “Alright, explain.”“They released him due to lack of evidence. Also, the lawyer reasoned out that eventhough Archie pleaded guilty for stealing the phone, technically he didn’t steal it.”You raise your eyebrow.“He said that I left my phone in class. He planned to return it but forgot until Veronica saw he had it,” she breathes out. “Charges can’t be pressed for theft because of that. Or attempted murder on your case because no one knows where the phone is so there’s no evidence that would connect any of them to the accident because Archie claims he have lost it before your accident.”She pauses as she looks at you, a tear rolling down her cheek. You quickly reached out and cupped that side of her face to brush away the stray tear.“Hey, it’ll be alright, okay?” you try to reassure her. “Look, I’m alive.”She shakes her head. “It’s not only that, Y/N. Reggie said..”She was cut off by the knocks on the door. You call out for the person to come in. The door opened revealing Edward followed by your family lawyer, Jacob Ashford.You kiss Cheryl’s forehead before straightening up, putting on a blank face.“Jacob, I wasn’t expecting you today,” you remarked.“My apology, Miss Riley,” his gaze fixed firmly on yours. “Certain circumstances require for me to see you today.”You nod at him before turning to the two girls. “Cher, I’m afraid we need to take a raincheck for today’s sleepover. Toni, please take her home. Edward will see you out.”Toni nods and gently pulls Cheryl up. However, the redhead moves swiftly and engulfs you in a hug. “I think your lawyer’s gonna inform you of what Reggie told me on the phone. Call me tonight,” she whispers before pulling away.As soon as you hear the door close, you gestured for him to take a seat before you take yours behind the desk.“I assume this has something to do with Archie Andrews’ release,” you start off.“Partly,” he leans against the chair. “FBI Agent Arthur Adams’ body was found hanging this morning along with a suicide letter stating he was the one who tampered with your car’s wheel. That, itself, aided Andrews’ release.”You turn your gaze up to meet his eyes. “A suicide letter indicated he set me up? And pray tell, what specific idiotic reasoning made him commit suicide?”“Apparently,” he clears his throat, “he wrote he misjudged your family when he sabotaged your car. When he found out what you and your family are possibly capable of, he feared for his family’s well-being.”You bite your lip to suppress a laugh. You take a deep breath as you let out a chuckle. “That’s the best they can come up with? Us being after his family?”You finally gave in, a humorless cackle escaping your lips.“Surely, they could do better done that,” you try to catch your breath. “How convenient, the Lodge’s rogue ex-mafia capo commits suicide confessing a crime he clearly did not commit, saving the Lodge princess’ boy toy.”“Would you like me to file a counter?” the lawyer asks nonchalantly. “No need to,” you reiterate. “Doing so would require us to connect him to the mafia. Doing so would tip our hands too early.”He clicks his tongue and takes it into consideration, finally nodding after realizing how it’s in their best interests not to do anything any further.“With the focus shifted on Adams, we have nothing to pin on either the Andrews kid or the younger Lodge,” he points out.“Not for now, Jacob,” you agreed with him as you stand up, moving towards the table with the chess set. “However, in the long run….” you drawl out as you take a seat behind the black pieces, still facing him.“What do you have in mind, kid?” he observes your body language but just like your grandfather, he finds it hard to read you. As a lawyer, he finds it frustrating, but as a mentor, he can’t help but be proud.“Easy, with Archie being involved in a crime that led to a case of attempted murder, despite not being guilty of the attempted murder himself, his reputation now only lies in tatters. Same with the younger Lodge. Though I thought it would be easy to get rid of Archie but… Oh well. Our biggest advantage lies not with them, however,” you smirk. “How’s Peters liking his new office?”“I still don’t know how you did it,” he places his finger on the globe on top of the desk, spinning it lightly.“You don’t need to know how I did it,” you retort causing him to chuckle. “Anyway, a friend of mine found this lying around at school. I don’t think it’s of anymore use for anyone. I’m not a fan of iphones. Get rid of it. It won’t do us good if someone finds out about it being in my possession.”Jacob finds himself catching a transparent ziplock bag. His eyes widening a bit as he recognizes the cherry red casing. He turns it over and confirms what it is. “H-how.. How did you–,” he stammers as he looks at you. Now with your phone in hand, you turn your gaze at him innocently.“Oh and remember not to park at the garage for now. I’m gonna renovate it and add more room for tools and more vehicle parts. I think I’m going to experiment more after that success with the Bugatti last week,” she thoughtfully recalls.He blinks as he looks at you curiously. He then shifts his eyes back to the phone. Then turns back to you, he notices how you’re looking at him in expectancy.With all the composure he can manage, he stands up and fixes his cufflinks before looking down at his Rolex.“It’s been quite a day with you, Miss Riley,” he speaks out as he stares at you with a newfound recognition. “I’ll be on my way.”Your lips upturn as his change in demeanor. You wave dismissively causing him to head out the door. You find yourself in appreciation of his professionalism, a trait which had always been the reason why your family makes use of their services.Lost in thought, you recall everything that took place eversince your return. You almost dropped your phone when it rang.“Dilton, hello. It’s been a while. You never did visit me while I was at the hospital.”“Hey, Y/N. I’m sorry. I figured it was best if nobody noticed. Just in case…” You can sense his nervousness through the line.“I understand, don’t worry about it. What’s up?”“Oh, I just wanted to thank you for the camera. It arrived yesterday. I would’ve called yesterday but things at school were really intense.”“Don’t mention it, Dilton. You have a talent not only in nature photography but also in cinematography. It was a shame that you didn’t have appropriate lenses to use,” you reason out. “Besides, consider it as payment for the favor I asked you.”You can hear Dilton pause and breathe out on the other line. “Alright, Y/N. But I was just at the right place at the right time when I heard them. It sounded fishy so I took a video and nicked the phone when I had class with Andrews.“"You’re one very lucky guy, Dilton. You just saved me from a lot of trouble, you have no idea,” you tell him with all the sincerity you can muster.“I’m still sorry about you getting in an accident, Y/N. If I’d known…” he trails off. “I also heard about Andrews being let off the hook. I’m sorry I couldn’t help you more. If only I could.”"Don’t worry about it, D. I gotta go now. Enjoy that camera,” you bade him goodbye.You think about how it all played out with Dilton. You remember how pale he appeared when he told you about what he overheard. He showed you the video and you gave him instructions to release it if ever anything happened to you; not that you were doubtful that something would happen considering the plans you came up with. You then asked him to steal the phone back.He was the one who texted you when you were at the music room with Jughead confirming it’s been done. You texted him back to tell him to leave it at the Gray Manor and not to tell anyone about it. Not that he would.You lean back against the chair as you stare at the ceiling. You sigh which causes for your eyes to land on your grandfather’s portrait. His eyes mirroring yours. It has always been something you’ve always been proud of. You have your grandfather’s eyes unlike your father who took after your grandmother and Elena who took after your mother.“If only Veronica was careful enough,” you click your tongue as you remember the video. “Dilton really got lucky.”You feel your injured hand ache a bit making you remember Archie. Furthermore, your eyes take sight of the chess pieces scattered on the board.You tap on the black rook lightly as you eye the white knight that’s positioned in its path. You sigh knowing it’s not your turn.“Archie, Archie, Archie… You’re either very lucky or very valuable,” your lips cast a bit downward as you remember Arthur Adams’ death. You reach for the white queen, and move it a few squares forward blocking the black rook from attacking the vulnerable white knight.“Nice move, Mrs. Lodge. Nice move.”

anonymous asked:73 with pike Jj because mood73. I feel like when I eat I do better in life  -“Babe,” JJ groaned, slumped on your apartment counter, “I’m dying.”“We’re all dying, JJ. Every day is one day closer to the inevitable end.”His mouth opened and closed a few times, trying to come up with an answer, before settling on, “That was morbid as fuck. But back to me, I’m dying.”You sighed, “Okay, enlighten me, why are you dying now more than usual?”“I haven’t eaten in almost 6 hours and you promised to make pasta.”“No, I promised to help you learn how to make pasta so that when you’re living by yourself this summer you don’t order out every single night or just choose to not eat.”“I’m sure I’ll be fine,” he tried to dismiss.But you shook your head, “No, I know you, we’re best friends- ““And more,” he cut you off.“And more. And I know you’ll go for convenience every time.”JJ pouted, “Am I really that predictable?”“To me? Yes.”He pouted, “Well, why can’t we just order tonight because I’m hungry now and then we can cook after we eat.”“That defeats the purpose.”“No, but see, I don’t know how to cook and I feel like when I eat, I do better in life. So if we eat first, I’ll be a better cook.”“I feel like maybe you’re not really getting the point of cooking.”“My logic is flawless,” JJ told you, waving his hand, “I’ll order pizza, do you want cinnamon bread?”“I-“ you sighed, “yeah, cinnamon bread sounds nice.”“Yes,” he cheered, grabbing his phone.

anonymous asked:For the prompts, number 62 soukoku please62. “It’s okay to cry…” (I swear I was going to something bittersweet but then it somehow turned into a coma au, I’m so sorry.) “Dazai, how many times do I have to tell you it’s okay to cry. So don’t hide your pain in front of me. We’re partners aren’t we?” “Dazai… You know it’s okay to cry right. You sit by his bed every day without a single trace of emotion across your face. Almost like…” Gold eyes searched his face for something Dazai wasn’t sure he possessed anymore. “You’re no longer human.” Laughing at the unintentional jab at his ability name, Dazai turned to the blonde detective. “What a nostalgic sentence.” The brunet mused while amber eyes reflected a vast emptiness within. “To think you’d use the exact same wording as the hatrack lying here.” Kunikida sighed. Dazai wasn’t the type to openly display his emotions, but his fondness for the executive was no secret to anyone in the agency or the mafia. The only one matched his level of concern for Chuuya was a beautiful pink haired executive who considered him to be family. “Have you heard what Yosano-sensei and the Port Mafia boss had to say about his case.” The brunet nodded. “May never wake up again.” “…Dazai.” “In the end, it’s really up to Chuuya if he wakes up or not. I can’t force him to return.” ’No matter how much I regret it.’ Leaving the brunet to his thoughts, Kunikida stepped into the hallway but stood in the doorway.  “Have you tried bringing him back?” A sad smile crossed Dazai’s face as his hand brushed aside Chuuya’s bangs and then gently touched his cheek. “If the dream he sees is a world so beautiful and compelling he refuses to return…” He rose from his chair after tightly squeezing the unconscious executive’s hand. “If that’s the case, then who am I to shatter it.”
