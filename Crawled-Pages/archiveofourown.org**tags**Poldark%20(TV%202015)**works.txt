    Summary
      Knocking around Europe until their life on the streets became too difficult, Ross and Dem find their own Eden in Positano, Italy. Many of the locals are wary of these wayward strangers, unscrupulous developers covet the land they found, their romantic looks and vagabond life fascinate the moneyed vacationers and aristocracy that party in the castles and grand houses nearby. Everyone wants a piece of what they've got but they just want a quiet life, away from their demons, and each other's love.

    Summary
      “Morwenna. What’s that?”She followed his outstretched finger across the grounds, towards the edge of the forest. Something in her stomach lurched and plunged. Morwenna’s breath seized in her chest.At the far end of the field, where the tall grasses met the tree line and vanished into inscrutable forest, he was almost too small to notice. The dark form huddled on the ground could easily have been mistaken for an animal… until one noticed the odd position of limbs, and the arms twined tight around broad shoulders. Curling in on himself managed only to make him smaller, not preserve any much-needed heat. He was pressed up against the tree as if it could provide even a sliver of warmth in the frigid morning air.Morwenna’s breath caught in her chest. Her heart seized. Drake.
