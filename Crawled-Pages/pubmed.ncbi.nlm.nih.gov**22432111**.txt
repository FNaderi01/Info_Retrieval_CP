      Abstract
        Objective:
      Our objective was to determine the secular trend in prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Shanghai, China.
        Research design and methods:
      Two consecutive population-based surveys for type 2 diabetes were conducted in randomly selected adults aged 35-74 years in Shanghai in 2002-2003 (n = 12,329) and in 2009 (n = 7,423). Diagnosed type 2 diabetes was determined based on self-report, whereas those undiagnosed were identified by measured fasting and postload glucose according to 2009 American Diabetes Association criteria.
        Results:
      Age-standardized prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed type 2 diabetes increased from 5.1 and 4.6% in 2002-2003 to 7.4 and 5.2% in 2009. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes increased with age and was higher among men and in urban residents in both surveys (P &lt; 0.001). Between the two surveys, the increase in the prevalence was more evident in the rural population (P &lt; 0.001) and appeared more rapid in younger birth cohorts (P &lt; 0.05).
        Conclusions:
      Our results suggest that Shanghai has experienced an increasing burden of type 2 diabetes.
