Discussion[edit]
Thanks for removing the border, I overlooked that edit. I had the border live only due to editing practice ("sandboxing") and forgot to take it out.
Also, I tried (not good enoug) to squeeze it narrower left to right, but it's better now. Most monitors will not fit it any wider than it currently is. Doctorindy (talk) 03:18, 5 March 2008 (UTC)
Coyne/Wilson[edit]
Wilson ran with the #19 on the car at St Pete, but looks like he will probably run with #18 for the rest of the season.  I've hence changed the car number next to him to 18/19, but please feel free to comment here if you think otherwise? Oli.meggitt (talk) 15:44, 23 April 2009 (UTC)
The template is supposed to represent the current driver/car lineup, meaning that only #18 should be shown. -Drdisque (talk) 17:34, 23 April 2009 (UTC)
OK, thanks for clarifying, I will change it back Oli.meggitt (talk) 19:17, 23 April 2009 (UTC)
Tracy at Foyt's team[edit]
Should Paul Tracy be added alongside the now injured Vitor Meira in the template? I almost added him, but what stopped me is that right now Tracy's deal with A.J. Foyt Enterprises is only for Milwaukee; Texas and the rest of the year are still TBD. Should he be added, or is it still too early?
Also should Will Power be added under Penske Racing?
97.125.96.132 (talk) 00:34, 27 May 2009 (UTC)
I'd add Tracy if he shows up in a second race, for now it might be best to put a little (INJ) next to Vitor to signify that he isn't currently driving the car. We don't have Power listed because the #12 isn't a full-time or nearly full-time car. If at some point it appears to be more or less a full-time car, then would be the time to add it. -Drdisque (talk) 02:13, 27 May 2009 (UTC)
Changes, changes[edit]
Ryan Hunter-Reay is now in the #14 for the rest of the year. Someone has changed the Foyt lineup to reflect only the past two races (Tracy/Foyt IV, which doesn't make much sense to me); should it be shown as Meira (INJ)/Hunter-Reay? And then, should Hunter-Reay still be shown under Vision Racing? 97.125.92.220 (talk) 07:03, 13 June 2009 (UTC)
2010 template[edit]
When does everyone think a re-design of this template for the 2010 season should be put together?Manningmbd 13:08, 19 February 2010 (UTC)
I'm going to work on it after we see who shows up at the Barber test. Froo (talk) 16:09, 21 February 2010 (UTC)
Make a template for each year[edit]
There should be one of these templates made for each year, e.g., Template:2012 IndyCar Series, so that you don't have the hard code of the template at the bottom of each article, like at the 2010 IndyCar Series season navbox. That way, you can add the template to each article and save a lot of kBs in the article too. --Funandtrvl (talk) 23:42, 5 July 2012 (UTC)
Do we really want to add 20-odd templates to articles like Michael Andretti? Where is the benefit? --Falcadore (talk) 03:30, 6 July 2012 (UTC)
Takuma Sato[edit]
In looking at the Takuma Sato article, it has this template which is labeled the 2012 IndyCar Series.  However, it shows 49 starts, which is incorrect if we are just looking at 2012 but correct over multiple years.  Is the template being used incorrectly at that article or should the year be removed from this template? 72Dino (talk) 18:50, 17 September 2012 (UTC)
