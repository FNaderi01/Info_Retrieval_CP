    Summary
      What happens if you cross the Babybones and Judge Sans AUs And then stick in a little “Sans and Papyrus are not related”? This mess of a fanfic.Or, different characters wishing upon the echo flowers.Notes:This is my first published fanfic, so please feel free to leave constructive criticism!This fanfic is on hiatus, most likely permanent, due to a lack of motivation on my part, and having both slipped out of the fandom and not wanting to publish fanfics as much now... still subject to change, though &gt;u&lt;

    Graphic Depictions Of Violence Major Character DeathSans (Undertale)Sans-centric Sans Skeleton Sans is now a trainer? what? Sans Needs A Hug Sans will need many hugs Pokemon Pokemon Journey it's a crossover Based off my Nuzlocke Run in Soul Silver Pokemon Undertale crossover! Don't judge! Okay maybe judge! Enter the world of Pokemon with Sans the Skeleton! skelepun Papyrus is the mom lol Mom Paps
    Summary
      “Would you like to…become a trainer Sans?”Yup, that's right. Sans woke up this morning and now he is a trainer. Weird, huh?It gets better, because the professor wants him to go to Mr. Pokemon's house. Simple right? But it doesn't stop there, oh, no. Now he's on a mission; becoming the champion of Johto. Not exactly what the lazy Skelepun dreamed of but...hey...why not?That's what you do when you live in the world of Pokemon. Yup, everything is totally normal.Yet Sans swears there is something weird going on. Why can't he shake the feeling that he's not meant to be here? How come some of these "Pokemon" are acting so...murderous? Where are all these random memories coming from? And what do all these nightmares mean?Oh well, might as well go along with it, yeah? After all, new buddies to meet, new places to see, and Pokemon all over the place! Maybe a lot more violent then he would like but hey, there are still fun times ahead! What could possibly go wrong?
