      Chapter 8: Precautions made and the “Miraculous Team of Europe” begin
    Chapter Text
Hawkmoth is left to metaphorically lick his literal wounds
In that time of temporary peace, a strange, new office building is erected in Paris, not far from the school and bakery.
Despite its bland appearance, it really is quite the HQ
it has a fully decked out gym and showers,
dormitories for hiding out in case of an identity crisis, including spare rooms for persons of interest and loved ones to hide out in as well,
a very large kitchen with all amenities,
several meeting rooms for tactics, team building, what have you,
a special, reinforced training chamber for advanced power containment (sparring room with several-layer thick metal walls and special equipment meant to suppress Kryptonian abilities enough for more balanced physical training/sparring),
several discreet entrances,
an advanced infirmary,
a workshop/armory for them to store their special/magical weapons and batarangs as well as develop *cough*design*cough* armor, suits, and tools for special occasions
and, of course, a trophy room/storage room
about two months after the building is complete, one nightly patrol, Robin and Calliope don’t show up, instead the two receive a call from Robin to meet on top of the office building.
They arrive and don’t find anyone there, though they do find a wide-open door, practically begging them to come in,
They’re cautious, but enter, fully prepared for a trap, they follow the lit hallways towards a large steel door, opened enough for them to see Damian and Marinette, tangled together on a large cushioned mat, under clear LED lights with what appear to be soft green neon lights as well (think about the supergirl series)
As they get closer, they hear Damian gently instructing Marinette along in how to escape from their position and Marinette slowly follows along as he instructs her.
Pixie and Chat walk into the room and do a quick visual sweep of it before stepping in,
No cameras
No obvious traps,
It looks like some of the panels in the walls can be opened but that may just be storage or design,
Chat clears his throat and draws Damian’s attention, but in his distraction, Marinette turns the tables and flips over him pulling him into an armbar.
He lets out a breathy laugh before easily pulling himself out and coming to a stance above her.
he then helps her up and they turn to face the newcomers, giving Chat and Pixie a chance to notice their athletic wear,
Marinette was wearing a fitted crop top and a pair of shorts of her hero persona’s colors, she seemed physically drained, which Rose didn’t notice was unusual until she realized that, Marinette is literally never tired.
Damian was wearing a simple red tank top with a pair of green gym shorts, and while he may not have seemed as worn out as Marinette was, unlike her, his skin had a particular sheen, and his shirt was damp in a few places as if he were working out.
The blonde pair take a second of awkwardly staring at the two before they gasp simultaneously.
This is about when Damian turns the green light off, and Marinette immediately starts to look energized.
Marinette assures them that they don’t need to reveal themselves, she’d already spoken with Fu about how important the Miraculous secrets are.
They’re both excited to have their own base of operations and training center and everything.
Marinette gives them a tour and even shows them their own rooms, while Damian hits the showers
While they’re separated, Pixie can’t help but ask about Damian and Marinette’s relationship
Marinette is caught off-guard and is too flustered to answer
Rose will drill her for information in class, later
Unsatisfied with this answer, when they all meet back up on the roof, Pixie asks Damian about it
He says one of those things that is simple yet kinda profound?
Marinette.exe has stopped responding
They decide that patrol can be put to rest that night and Pixie and Chat head home, excited about their new base and knowing that their friends are also their partners in heroism,
Damian walks Marinette back to her place, and they have one of those short talks that people have in front of the door, because they want to spend a few more minutes together.
They talk about training and classes and homework, and while Damian, very briefly, looks away, she strikes, leaning in close to plant a kiss on his cheek.
Fortunately for both of them, Damian’s distraction ended as she started leaning in.
As he turns his head back to her, her lips make contact with the corner of his own.
She pulls away surprised that he turned, and they stare at each other, both increasingly red-faced
A switch in Damian’s head switches to ‘Screw it’ and he takes her hand, gently pulling her a bit closer,
“For a girl with superhuman sight and reflexes, you have terrible aim.”
They kiss for real.
The moment is ruined when Clark opens the door to leave and catches them, with Jon still hugging Sabine and Tom, goodbye, right behind him,
“Oh, there you are!” ~Clark
“I knew it!” ~Jon and Tom
*Already planning ways to spoil her grandchildren* ~Sabine
