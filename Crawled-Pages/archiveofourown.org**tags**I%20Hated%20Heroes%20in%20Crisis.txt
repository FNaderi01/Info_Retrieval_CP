    Summary
      It's a common thing among the Batfamily, and the Superhero community in general, to have strong disagreements about the events of Sanctuary. Bart Allen has recently returned from the future, and after everything with the Titans and the Flash family has died down, Bart has some disbeliefs about the testimonies provided.Good thing he knows an amazing detective and his family.
