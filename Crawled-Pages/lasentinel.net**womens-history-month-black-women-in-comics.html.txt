				By Sentinel Staff Report                
	                	                Published March 15, 2018
		Black women have been present in the comic book industry for years and they continue to shape and grow the industry.
During this Women’s History Month, we take a look at Black women who are contributing to the comic book industry. Whether showcasing black characters as super heroes and adventurers or opening the door to fantasy from a Black LGBTQ perspective, these women are changing the face of comics. Here are some of the Black women giving a multi-layered voice to the industry from the past and present.
