    Summary
      his first foolish idea was inviting her along this mission in this first place, and his next was hoping he’d have her as close as she is now. the foolish idea of sleeping with her hasn’t been something he’d imagined being possible, but now with his foolish lips less than angel’s whisper away from hers, he apologizes to his foolish heart for inviting the next hammer it will take to shatter when they have to say goodbye.

      "Oh my," a soft gasp escaped from her mouth. The result of the pregnancy test showed positive, and that's enough proof that Skull had been pregnant for about five weeks. Now, how was she supposed to hide it from everyone else?

    Summary
      Excerpt:[Ignoring the soreness of his body, Skull snuck out of Vongola Manor without seeing any of the guests from last night and went to the spacious garage where he last left his bike. He felt a little better when he saw that someone had washed his bike, giving back the original vibrance of its purple colored coat. He had planned to do it himself before this next show.
A pain struck him as he sat down on his bike, letting out a yelp in surprised. He felt tired and wanted to get back to his bedroom in the Carcassa Famiglia headquarters and hide away for a month. First breathing in a full breath to settle himself, Skull released it as he stirred the engines to life. Within his next breath, he was riding off, trying not to think about the two men he left behind, but briefly, he heard the sound of his heart shattering against the rocky path.]

    Summary
      Tsuna just wants to change for the better. She wants to get better at school, wants to get better at sports, wants to get socially better so she can make some friends so her mom stops worrying about her and she wants people to stop bullying her. That's all. That is why one night she makes a wish to a shooting star... she never expected the shooting star to send her a demon in toddler skin that claims to be a mafia tutor.
