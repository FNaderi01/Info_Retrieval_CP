    Summary
      "You want to go back or visit the more fuck up world ?""More like I want to live that fuck up world."In which Jimin got into coma. He had two choices but he choose to abandon his husband, Park Jungkook and woke up to walking dead world. Unfuckingfortunately, seems like Jimin and Jungkook are star-crossed mate.But this Jungkook is not the same like his soft husband, but worse. Badass but mean as fuck."I want you to love me because of who am I not the other version."

    Summary
      Did he understand that what he was doing was fucked up? Yup. Did he get that it could lead to him being expelled? Yes. Did it ever dawn on him that it was a cruel thing to do? Several times. Was that going to stop him? Nope. Deku is his. He's not going to let that two toned bastard take him away from him, even if he has to do something despicable to show Deku just who he belongs too.

    Summary
      His assailant leaps at him while he's distracted. Izuku shoves him on instinct, and the stranger shrieks when he hits the ground. He tries to roll over. There‚Äôs a vegetable knife sticking out of his back.‚ÄúFuck,‚Äù says Izuku. ‚ÄúFuck, oh god, I killed someone.‚Äù(Izuku does have a quirk - it's the power to see when someone has unhealthy attachment issues and obsessive tendencies. That would explain why some of his classmates seem a little off.Except Kacchan, probably. Kacchan's always been dangerous.)
