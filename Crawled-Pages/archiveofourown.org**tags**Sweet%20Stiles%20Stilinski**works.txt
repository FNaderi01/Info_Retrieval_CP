    Summary
      Derek Hale doesn't 'do' relationships. Not since Kate, and definitely not since Rosalind, his daughter. Not that he has much time anyway, in between work and being a single father. Plus, Rosy doesn't even like people. Like father, like daughter. Well, until they meet Stiles Stilinski.

A few of them, smaller and fluffier than the rest, are burdened with radiance.They couldn’t compete, though, with the glitter of Peter’s gaze as he studies Stiles. He’s intoxicated by his mate, between the scent of his aftershave and the way he moves his mouth- still swollen from their kisses.Jesus, it’s driving him insane, this nearness.:::::::::One lazy summer afternoon. Two lovers who are still living their passion in secret.For a few hours, Peter and Stiles create a little paradise for themselves... their own tiny slice of Eden.

Just like Peter's skin.The air he’s breathing… it’s Peter. Warm and sweet like his smile.The water he drinks. It’s Peter. Essential. Quenching.____It's Peter's birthday and Stiles doesn't want him to celebrate on his own.In planning something special for him, he accidentally reveals his feelings for the older man to Scott.

    Summary
      “Why are you so sad?” a tiny, male voice asked from right beside him.In all of his thoughts, Ennis had completely missed the young boy – probably only nine – sitting down next to him while holding a puzzle box in his hands. The boy was pale and slim with a myriad of moles dotted around his face and body in constellations. His wide, innocent, chocolate eyes were staring at Ennis with a child-like wonder that served to both ease and agitate the iron wolf. They held so much naiveite and yet Ennis could sense a pearl of hidden wisdom and awareness underneath the juvenile exterior – it was as if those eyes were staring into Ennis’ very soul, compelling him to reveal any information the boy wanted if only to keep those eyes on him more.“Did you lose someone too?” the boy’s voice lacked the grating tone that most children possessed before their voices cracked as well as the high-pitched whine.

    Summary
      “I used to be the useless one. The human one. Look at me now! I-I’m good! Even you have to admit Scott. I’m damn good. Maybe not the baddest witch-bitch in the business but I’m good!”
Mourning over the passing of their loved ones, (namely Erica, Aiden, Boyd and Allison) the pack decide their troubles lie on the human of their pack. Stiles. They had come used to the thought that Stiles was the type of person that would be hurt for a few seconds and they wouldn't even have to apologize, he just knew they were sorry. It's just a shame they assumed wrong as the next day, Stiles was gone from Beacon Hills and in his place turned up four familiar faces on doorsteps.
