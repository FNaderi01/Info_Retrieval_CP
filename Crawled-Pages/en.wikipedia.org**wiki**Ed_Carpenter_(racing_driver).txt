For 2008, Carpenter returned with Vision Racing to drive the No. 20 Dallara-Honda. At the season-opening Gainsco Auto Insurance Indy 300 at Homestead, Carpenter qualified in 2nd place, but his time was nullified as his car – as well as the car of teammate A. J.

2010[edit]
In 2010, Vision Racing lost its sponsors and as a result shut down as a full-time team. Therefore, Carpenter drove for Panther Racing in conjunction with Vision Racing in the No. 20 Dallara-Honda at the Indianapolis 500. In the race, Carpenter started in 8th place and finished in 17th place due to a caution occurring during a round of pit stops, which put Carpenter a lap down.

In the Firestone Twin 275s at Texas Motor Speedway, Carpenter started the opening race in 5th place and finished in 18th place. For the second race, Carpenter drew a 10th place starting position – via a random draw – and finished in 16th place. Following the two Texas races, Carpenter and the team began to struggle in qualifying and Carpenter had a best start of 14th place at the Iowa Corn Indy 250 at Iowa. Carpenter further struggled on the non-oval races, which resulted in his best finishes being a trio of 11th-place finishes at Indianapolis, Iowa and the MoveThatBlock.com Indy 225 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway. At the penultimate race of the season, the Kentucky Indy 300 at Kentucky, Carpenter started in 4th place and led for 8 laps.

Carpenter further struggled on non-oval races, resulting in a best finish of 12th place at the Chevrolet Detroit Belle Isle Grand Prix at Belle Isle. On the ovals Carpenter was more competitive; at the Indianapolis 500 Carpenter crashed during Pole Day qualifying and re-qualified on Bump Day. Carpenter started in 28th place and moved into the top five in the late stages of the race only to spin on lap 180, which took Carpenter out of contention; he finished in 21st place, one lap down. At Texas, Carpenter started in 19th place and quickly moved up through the field, only to finish in 12th place after dropping back late in the race. At the Milwaukee IndyFest at the Milwaukee Mile, Carpenter started in 22nd place and finished in 8th place, his first top ten of the season.

2013[edit]
  Carpenter (far right) was among the people that announced that Pocono Raceway would join the IndyCar Series in 2013.
Carpenter returned with ECR in 2013 to drive the No. 20 Dallara-Chevrolet. Carpenter improved his qualifying results on the ovals, with a worst start of 14th at the Pocono IndyCar 400 at Pocono Raceway. Despite this, Carpenter struggled away from the ovals, achieving a best start of 14th at the Itaipava São Paulo Indy 300, and a best finish of 13th in the opening race of the double-header in Toronto. On the ovals, Carpenter's results were significantly better, including pole position at the Indianapolis 500, where Carpenter's single-car team beat out all three cars fielded by Team Penske and all five cars fielded by Andretti Autosport, two of the largest teams in the series. In the race, Carpenter led for a race-high 37 laps, only to suffer handling issues in the second half of the race and dropped to a 10th-place finish. In the Firestone 550 at Texas, Carpenter qualified 9th and finished 4th. Carpenter's only disappointing oval race was the Milwaukee IndyFest at Milwaukee where Carpenter qualified 20th and finished 14th, two laps down. At the Iowa Corn Indy 250 at Iowa, Carpenter started and finished 4th after leading for 18 laps, being one of the few drivers to pose a threat to race winner James Hinchcliffe. Carpenter then finished 9th at Pocono, where the Chevrolet engines lacked the fuel economy of the rival Honda engines. Carpenter's next competitive race was at the season-ending MAVTV 500 IndyCar World Championships at Auto Club Speedway, where Carpenter started 7th and finished 2nd after leading for a single lap. Carpenter finished the season ranked 16th, with 333 points.
2014[edit]
In 2014, Carpenter decided to split driving the No. 20 with Mike Conway; Conway drove the road courses and street circuits while Carpenter drove the ovals. At Carpenter's season debut, the Indianapolis 500, Carpenter qualified on pole position for the second consecutive year. In the race, Carpenter, Ryan Hunter-Reay, Hélio Castroneves and Marco Andretti dominated the lead with Carpenter leading for 26 laps. On lap 176 on a restart for separate crashes between Scott Dixon and Josef Newgarden, Carpenter was running 2nd to Hunter-Reay when Townsend Bell went three wide in an attempt to pass Carpenter on the outside while James Hinchcliffe was on the inside of Carpenter. Hinchcliffe made contact with Carpenter, sending both of them into the wall. This ended Carpenter's race with a 27th-place finish. At Carpenter's next race, the Firestone 600 at Texas, he qualified 5th and soon battled with Will Power for the lead. Later, when Carpenter and Power were making pit stops, Power came into the pit lane too fast and had to serve a penalty. On lap 142 a caution came out for Takuma Sato who had an engine fire. Carpenter and 2nd place driver Juan Pablo Montoya stayed out while the remaining lead lap cars – Power, Simon Pagenaud, Dixon and Tony Kanaan – pitted to get new tires. On the restart, with three laps to go, Carpenter held off Power for his third career IndyCar Series win.
In the Pocono IndyCar 500 at Pocono, Carpenter started in 13th place, and finished in the same position after having to make an extra pit stop to replace a tire. At the following race, the Iowa Corn Indy 300 at Iowa, Carpenter started in 10th place. During the race Carpenter battled a loose car in the late stages of the race while running in the top 5. On lap 282 Carpenter made contact with Juan Pablo Montoya in turn 3, causing Montoya to crash out of the race. During an interview with the NBC Sports Network, Montoya called Carpenter a "douchebag". During the caution period Carpenter, Hunter-Reay, Newgarden and Graham Rahal all made pit stops for new tires. On the restart Hunter-Reay and Newgarden passed Kanaan, who had dominated the race up to that point, while Carpenter was able to finish up in fifth position. During the weekend of the ABC Supply Wisconsin 250 at Milwaukee, it was announced that Ed Carpenter Racing was to merge with Sarah Fisher Hartman Racing for the 2015 season, to form CFH Racing. In the race Carpenter started in 7th place and finished in 9th place. At the season-ending MAVTV 500 IndyCar World Championships at Auto Club Speedway, Carpenter nearly crashed on both of his laps in qualifying and therefore started in 14th place. During the race Carpenter's pit speed limiter did not function properly, which resulted in a drive-through penalty for speeding on pit lane. Carpenter recovered to finish in 3rd place behind Chip Ganassi Racing teammates Kanaan and Dixon. Carpenter finished 22nd in the final drivers' championship standings, with 262 points.
2015[edit]
  Carpenter at Texas in 2019
For 2015, Carpenter again shared the No. 20 Dallara-Chevrolet entry; he contested the oval races and Luca Filippi contested the non-oval races. Carpenter first competed at the Indianapolis 500. On the morning of Pole Day qualifying, Carpenter half-spun in turn 2 and the left side of the car hit the outside wall. The car flipped over and slid down the back straightaway. Carpenter was unhurt in the incident, but as a result of the incident and similar crashes earlier in the month, the series decided the reduce the boost on cars. During this time, Carpenter's team prepared his back-up car. Carpenter qualified 12th for the race, in which he struggled and was running in the top 15 when he attempted to pass Oriol Servià for position on lap 113. The two drivers made contact and crashed into the turn 1 wall and Carpenter was scored in 30th place. Carpenter then competed at the Firestone 600 at Texas; he started in 15th place and finished in 22nd place due to an engine failure after completing 147 laps. Two laps later, Carpenter's teammate Josef Newgarden also retired due to an engine failure. At the MAVTV 500 at Auto Club Speedway, Carpenter started in 4th place and was involved in a crash on the main straightaway with Newgarden on lap 158 and was scored in 22nd place.
