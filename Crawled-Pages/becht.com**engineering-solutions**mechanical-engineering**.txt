Fitness for Service
Are you worried the damage you just found will force you to shutdown your equipment?  Are you tired of spending large chunks of your budget fixing things that were just installed? Do you need to push the envelope on process conditions to get that competitive edge in margin or product quality? Becht is here to provide the right expertise with an owner’s perspective at a moment’s notice.
Emergency Support
Unplanned outages, both large and small, can result in significant loss of revenue, pose safety risks, and may render the plant unable to operate for extended periods. Becht takes the guess work out of getting the equipment back up and running as quickly and safely as possible. We leverage creative solutions to avoid long-lead replacements while remaining RAGAGEP (regularly and generally accepted good engineering practices) compliant. Our large staff of experienced engineers with an owner’s perspective address all aspects of any emergency or fire situation. We are ready and able to quickly respond to any emergency and immediately provide practical solutions to get individual equipment or entire units back in service.

Discovering corrosion, cracks, bulging, vibration, or other such issues can be unsettling and jeopardize reliability.

While establishing fitness-for-service we always look to safely limit lost opportunity production and find the root-cause to provide solutions both in the moment and in the future. We combine unparalleled multidiscipline expertise and depth of in-service knowledge with cutting edge analysis tools to solve challenging issues.
