with a ritual: a person who had a role in choosing me—an admissions
officer, an interviewer—would mention in his congratulations that I was
“different” from the other Asians. When I won a scholarship that paid
for part of my education, a selection panelist told me that I got it
because I had moving qualities of heart and originality that Asian
applicants generally lacked. Asian applicants were all so alike, and I
stood out. In truth, I wasn’t much different from other Asians I knew. I
was shy and reticent, played a musical instrument, spent summers
drilling math, and had strict parents to whom I was dutiful. But I got
the message: to be allowed through a narrow door, an Asian should
cultivate not just a sense of individuality but also ways to project
“Not like other Asians!”In a federal lawsuit filed in Massachusetts in 2014, a group
representing Asian-Americans is claiming that Harvard University’s
undergraduate-admissions practices unlawfully discriminate against
Asians. (Disclosure: Harvard is my employer, and I attended and teach at
the university’s law school.) The suit poses questions about what a
truly diverse college class might look like, spotlighting a group that
is often perceived as lacking internal diversity. The court complaint
quotes a college counsellor at the highly selective Hunter College High
School (which I happened to attend), who was reporting a
Harvard admissions officer’s feedback to the school: certain of its
Asian students weren’t admitted, the officer said, because “so many” of
them “looked just like” each other on paper.The lawsuit alleges that Harvard effectively employs quotas on the
number of Asians admitted and holds them to a higher standard than
whites. At selective colleges, Asians are demographically
overrepresented minorities, but they are underrepresented relative to
the applicant pool. Since the nineteen-nineties, the share of Asians in
Harvard’s freshman class has remained stable, at between sixteen and
nineteen per cent, while the percentage of Asians in the U.S. population
more than doubled. A 2009 Princeton study showed that Asians had to
score a hundred and forty points higher on the S.A.T. than whites to
have the same chance of admission to top universities. The
discrimination suit survived Harvard’s motion to dismiss last month and
is currently pending.When the New York Times reported, last week, that the Justice
Department’s Civil Rights Division was internally seeking lawyers to
investigate or litigate “intentional race-based discrimination in
college and university admissions,” many people immediately assumed that
the Trump Administration was hoping to benefit whites by assailing
affirmative action. The Department soon insisted that it specifically
intends to revive a 2015 complaint against Harvard filed with the
Education and Justice Departments by sixty-four Asian-American groups,
making the same claim as the current court case: that Harvard
intentionally discriminates against Asians in admissions, giving whites
an advantage. (The complaint had previously been dismissed in light of
the already-pending lawsuit.) The combination of the lawsuit and the
potential federal civil-rights inquiry signals that the treatment of
Asians will frame the next phase of the legal debate over race-conscious
admissions programs.Just last year, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the
University of Texas at Austin’s affirmative-action program, which, like
Harvard’s, aims to build a diverse class along multiple dimensions and
considers race as one factor in a holistic review of each applicant.
Justice Kennedy, writing for the majority, approved of a university’s
ability to define “intangible characteristics, like student body
diversity, that are central to its identity and educational mission.”
Incidentally, the phrase “intangible characteristics” echoes the sort of
language that often describes the individualizing or leadership
qualities that many Asian-American applicants, perceived as grinds with
high test scores, are deemed to lack. The complaint against Harvard
highlights the school’s history of using similar language to describe
Jewish students nearly a century ago, which led to a “diversity”
rationale designed to limit Jewish enrollment in favor of applicants
from regions with fewer Jews, such as the Midwest. If diversity of
various kinds is central to an élite school’s mission, an Asian may have
to swim upstream to be admitted.The U.T. affirmative-action case was brought by a white student and
financed by Edward Blum, a white Jewish conservative who is also
financing the lawsuit against Harvard. Justice Alito’s dissent in the
U.T. case said that, in failing to note that U.T.’s admissions practices
discriminated against Asians, the Court’s majority acted “almost as if
Asian-American students do not exist.” For Asian-Americans—the majority
of whom support affirmative action—being cast in the foreground of the
affirmative-action debate can be awkward and painful. Affirmative action
has consistently been a “wedge” issue, and groups such as Asian
Americans Advancing Justice have opposed attempts to use Asian students
as the wedge in conservative attacks on affirmative action that may harm
black and Latino students. Some simply deny that race-conscious
admissions procedures are disadvantaging Asians at all, which avoids
confronting a complicated dilemma.The Harvard lawsuit does raise uncomfortable questions, especially in a
time when it is also becoming less comfortable to be an immigrant. Is an
admissions process that disadvantages a minority group benign, or even
desirable, if that minority group is demographically overrepresented in
higher education? Should colleges pursue their interest in a diverse
class by limiting admissions of a minority group whose numbers may
otherwise overwhelm the class?Because our legal doctrine prohibits racial quotas, it is currently
impossible to have an honest discussion of these questions. The truth is
that, in addition to a holistic review of each applicant that considers
race as one factor, colleges undertake some amount of balancing so that
they do not end up with a class that is swamped by members of any
particular race—or with too many scientists, poets, or dancers, for that
matter. But admissions offices cannot admit to efforts at racial
balancing or anything that sounds remotely like quotas. Hence, Harvard’s
litigation position must attribute the resulting race composition and
the percentage of Asians in its class solely to the holistic method,
admitting to no racial balancing. This account is plausible if, in fact,
despite disproportionately strong academic credentials, Asian
applicants are severely less likely than white ones to have the special
personal qualities that colleges seek. That is the inevitable
implication of Harvard’s position, which would be in line with
long-standing perceptions of Asians as indistinguishable from one
another. The lawsuit may well entail an inquiry into whether Asian
applicants’ non-academic qualifications were disproportionately
un-special compared to those of white applicants. (In addition to
Harvard submitting comprehensive admissions data for discovery in the
case, several competitive high schools with large numbers of Asian
students are also being asked to provide information about their
students’ applications to Harvard.)But this lawsuit, and much of the discussion of affirmative action that
surrounds it, makes a serious error in assuming that, in order to stop
discrimination against Asian applicants, race-conscious affirmative
action must end. The argument simply proves too much. Continued use of
affirmative action of the kind upheld by the Supreme Court is perfectly
compatible with tackling the discrimination at issue. The problem is not
race-conscious holistic review; rather, it is the added, sub-rosa
deployment of racial balancing in a manner that keeps the number of
Asians so artificially low relative to whites who are less strong on
academic measures. It is also time to look seriously at the impact on
Asians (many of them immigrants or the children of immigrants) of the
advantage enjoyed by legacy admissions and wealthy families who are
likely to give significant donations. It distorts and confuses the
debate to lay the preferential treatment for whites over Asians at the
feet of affirmative action—or, on the other side, to deny that Asians
are disadvantaged in admissions today.In the pursuit of diversity, some amount of racial balancing seems
unavoidable, however taboo. We should not want the composition of our
élite universities to be wildly out of proportion to the racial
composition of our country. Such lopsided access to gateways of
opportunity and power—say, with whites being severely underrepresented
at schools like Harvard—has the potential to fuel dangerous resentment
and disturb social peace, at least if the change occurs too far ahead of
demographic changes that are projected to make whites a minority in this
country in less than three decades. I would not relish seeing the
nation’s most élite colleges become majority Asian, which is what has
resulted at selective high schools, such as Stuyvesant, that do not
consider race in admissions at all. It is also extremely troubling when
solely test-based admissions such as Stuyvesant’s reflect the failure to
remedy structural disadvantages suffered by black and Latino students.
What is needed instead, then, is race-conscious affirmative action, to
address the historic discrimination and underrepresentation of blacks
and Latinos, in combination with far less severity in the favoring of
whites relative to Asians.Harvard and other schools will vigorously defend their use of
race-conscious affirmative action along the lines previously upheld by
the Supreme Court. Outside of court, the Asian-discrimination claim may
move colleges to refine their admissions procedures and better calibrate
for diversity and fairness. It is unrealistic to think that universities
like Harvard can immediately stop privileging white applicants, given
the current whiteness of their donors, but that picture will change over
time. It was as Jews gained more political power and became more likely
to be donors that élite schools’ discrimination against them waned. And,
for the first time, racial minorities are a majority of this year’s
entering class at Harvard. The enrollment of Asians is the highest ever,
at more than twenty-two per cent, with their increased share cutting
into white, rather than black or Latino, enrollment. Those trends will
be hard to reverse, and other schools will follow suit. For
Asian-American students, the imperative to show originality will
continue. But I hope that we can soon say goodbye to the admissions
ritual whereby an Asian student is paradoxically expected to represent
other Asians by proving she is different from them.Jeannie Suk Gersen is a contributing writer to The New Yorker and a professor at Harvard Law School.More:Harvard UniversityAffirmative ActionDonald TrumpAsian-AmericansThe DailySign up for our daily newsletter and get the best of The New Yorker in your in-box.Enter your e-mail addressSign upWill be used in accordance with our Privacy Policy.Read MoreCulture DeskHarvard’s Ugly Offshoot of Campus Meme CultureBy Eren OrbeyLetter from OberlinThe Big UneasyWhat’s roiling the liberal-arts campus?By Nathan HellerVideoStuttererAs the Oscar-winning short film “Stutterer” shows, communication, like love, is never easy.SectionsNewsBooks &amp; CultureFiction &amp; PoetryHumor &amp; CartoonsMagazineCrosswordVideoPodcastsArchiveGoings OnMoreCustomer CareBuy Covers and CartoonsDigital AccessNewslettersJigsaw PuzzleRSSSite MapAboutCareersContactFAQMedia KitPressAccessibility HelpCondé Nast Spotlight© 2020 Condé Nast.
