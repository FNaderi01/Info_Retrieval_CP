                                                            This was requested a bunch! “You always turn me on when you come over.”	Max
was a pretty good student. She earned the occasional A, but mostly
stayed decent collecting a sea of B pluses and minuses. It was in
English that she had been earning her lowest marks. When Susan
mentioned that to your mother, the two of them working together at a
front desk in the town over, you found yourself being corralled into
tutoring. It wasn’t a steady gig, just going over after school once
in a while to read over her assignments or help her with questions
after certain chapters had been read. You liked to read and always
had, so it didn’t feel tedious to sit around the Hargrove’s coffee
table or on Max’s bed and talk about Lord of the Flies or
The Outsiders.	“How’s
our girl doing?” Billy whistled his way around the corner, a
shit-eating grin spread from his dangling earring to his unpierced
ear. You had left Max’s room all of two seconds ago and were at the
front door, tying up your laces on their scuffed up welcome mat.
Billy cocked his head to the side, trying to see if he could catch a
peek of your underwear beneath your denim skirt.	“She’s
fine.” Half-laughing, you told him. It was strange to hear him
refer to his redheaded step-sister that way. They did not seem close
and you knew he wasn’t interested in her academic success.	“Thanks
to you.” Billy folded his arms over himself, flexing both arms, as
he leaned into the door frame. His eyes must have had teeth because
you could feel them feasting on you, especially your legs, as you
stood up from the ground.	“It’s
all her. She’s great.” You picked up your purse from the ground and
swung it over your shoulder. Susan and Neil were supposed to be home
by now, but the Hargrove house was small for a family of four and
there was no sign of either parent anywhere. “Did her mom or your
dad leave an envelope anywhere?” The tutoring gig didn’t steadily
pay, but Susan had promised some compensation. Today was your day to
collect twenty bucks and you were looking forward to spending it in
the cosmetic aisle of the closest CVS.	Billy
smacked his lips together, giving his tongue a break from wagging at
you as he visualized what your ankles would look like over his
shoulders. He took his time moving to the small kitchen area, sliding
his hand around the counter and then glancing at the magnets on the
fridge.	“Nope.”
He shook his head at you and came around the half wall. You two were
close enough to touch if either raised an arm. You held onto the
straps of your purse and stepped back closer to the front door.	“I’ll
just ask her next time.” You said in defeat.	“You
could stay. We could hang out. They’ll be back eventually.” Billy
knew very well that Neil and Susan ran on their own schedule. He
always wound up watching Max hours later than usual. He didn’t know
what the two of them got up to, but he really didn’t want to know
either. Billy shrugged and slid his eyes away from you, leading them
around the living room as if to think of options to give you. “You
could help me with my homework.” Slyly, he suggested and rolled his
head over to you, eyes fluttering in a way that seemed practiced.	“No,
thank you.”	“Come
on.” He reached for your wrist and you let him have it, limp. Right
away, he ran his thumb across it, studying the lines over it like
pencil thin waves. “You always turn me on when you come over and I
have a hot for teacher fantasy.” He showed off his teeth as he
grinned, eyes sliding up to see if you were taking his bait. He knew
how to charm girls, but you were a different prey. Billy wasn’t sure
if you would laugh, agree, or recoil.	You
took back your hand without much force and turned to help yourself to
the door knob, leading yourself out of the house.	“I
don’t think you can afford my rates, Billy.” Teasing him right
back, you told him in a low voice. “Besides, I’m really more of a
naughty school girl.” With a wink, you closed the door, but you
heard him groan on the other side and just imagined his mullet
falling as he dipped his head back. If he thought he wanted to bed
you before, he was desperate to now. The game had changed and he was
ready to play.

Also wedding and grad season is just a busy time of year for me, but I have not stopped with Billy stories. Just tending to life stuff at the moment. Hope you’re all well.
