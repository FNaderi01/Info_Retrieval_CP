  Summary
    Part 1 (Litanie contre la Peur) - More character driven. Focuses on the relationships within the series.Part 2 (Legion Inoculant) - In outline. Much more story driven than Litanie. Relationships take a “back seat” from here on out. My horcruxes are introduced here.Part 3 (Mockingbeat) - In outline. Slight AU sixth year. Part 4 (Eon Blue Apocalypse) - In outline. Slight AU seventh year.

    Summary
      Yuuri came across a big problem just a few days before a competition, a problem that included clothing. 
Yuri, having heard about the problem, came across an idea that could help. Hey, he had a college degree, he should take the chance. So there he was, spending late nights and many hours, trying to Stitch the problem back together into a solution he hoped Yuuri would accept.
All he needed was his sewing machine and a few other things.
(This isn't a good enough summary, I'm sorry)

    Summary
      Katsuki Yuuri is an ex-figure skater, forced to retire due to a tragic accident two years ago. The very same one that wiped out his memories from the entirety of his career. He now lives in a different country as a florist, deciding to lead a calm, underwhelming life, not thriving to change a thing. But, when an unexpected customer barges into his shop right before closing time, Yuuri could find himself thrown so far back into his past, he might just realize that maybe his injuries were no accident, after all.
