      Chapter 9: First Time
          Summary:
            So this chapter is going to be more of a lime than a lemon, kind of fluffy to say the least.Also the events are a little different, Amity doesn't hate Luz and she's secretly friends with Willow!

    Chapter Text
    Horrible parents, one messed up morning.Small Forest ClearingSupply ClosetAmity x LuzCuts and bruises - art and friendship.Luz happily walked up the steps of Hexside school for Witches and Demons with her friends Willow and Gus beside her, chatting away as they walked down the hallway - soon splitting up to go to their respective classes.As Luz made her way to class she heard someone crying, she glanced around and headed toward the sound - she found herself standing in front of a supply closet, as she opened the door and peered inside she saw none other than Amity Blight - covered in scratches, bleeding from her arms and shoulder, a dark red hand-print on the left side of her face.The human was taken aback by the appearance of the Top Student, the most popular girl in the whole school - bleeding and looking broken, huddled up near some boxes with her arms wrapped around her knees as she cried - apparently her nose was also bleeding.Luz was absolutely horrified at the state that Amity was in, sure they weren't friends but they weren't enemies either. "And scoop!" Luz said, scooping Amity up in her arms and carried her out of the closet, then went to find a student from the Healing Track with Amity still in her arms.
  Weak nerd arms who?
After finally finding one of the Healing Track students and getting Amity fixed up, Luz took Amity to class. "You're late Miss- what happened to Miss Blight?" The teacher asked. "Long story short, I haven't the slightest clue - I just kind of found her." Was Luz's reply, setting Amity down in her seat but not leaving.When she was asked to leave she refused - saying she wanted to stay with Amity and help her through the day because of her injuries, and that's how it was for almost the entire day.Other students gave her the stink eye, wishing they were able to get so close to Amity as she had with such little effort, some felt respect for Luz, there were the envious people, the admiring kind, and the indifferent kind.Mostly they just stared as Luz carried Amity into the lunch hall, a large smile plastered on her face while Amity was hiding a deep rouge blush against Luz's chest - the brunette sat down with Amity in her lap, one arm supporting the jade and mint haired witch. "What happened to Amity?" Gus asked. "Honestly, I really don't know - I found her in the supply closet, bruised and bleeding." Luz left out the part that Amity had been crying and looking like an abused puppy.The witchling was still blushing as the human offered her some of her lunch, she gladly took it and just leaned against Luz's chest as the brunette held her close. "Have you been with her all day? I never saw you in class." Willow finally decided to break the momentary silence. "Yeah, she's still bleeding from some places and I didn't want her to pass out and then not have anyone find her for a whole hour. Sure we aren't friends but we're not enemies, I'm not cruel like her parents or a retarded bitch like Boscha." Luz replied. "I HEARD THAT!" Boscha yelled from her seat two tables over. "NO ONE CARES BOSCHA! IT'S TRUE!" Luz yelled back, covering Amity's pointed ears which were covered in the same blush that was on her face.After that, Luz was mostly silent apart from a few words here and there or asking Amity if she needed anything, and by the end of lunch Amity felt like she would be able to stand up - she was proved to be wrong the moment she tried to stand up, her legs shook violently and she began to collapse, a pair of arms went under her own and hoisted her back to her feet. "You should be more careful, Blight." Luz said, grinning.Luz hoisted Amity back up and onto her back, her pale arms wrapped around the latina's neck - Luz held onto the witchling's ankles, carrying her to her next class and sitting beside her. "Miss Noceda, go to your class." The teacher insisted. "No sir, she's staying with me." Amity said, smacking the teacher's hand away from Luz. "Y-Yes Miss Blight." The teacher stuttered and backed away.By the end of the day Amity had smacked a total of five hands, two teachers and three students - one of which was Boscha. As Luz carried Amity home she stopped in the middle of a floral forest clearing, setting Amity down in the grass as she pulled out a pad of paper and a pencil. "Hold still, okay?" Luz asked, looking up at Amity and then back at the paper - vigorously drawing.When she finished drawing she showed Amity, it was a very detailed picture of her - with a fine line between her minty undercut and her jade green hair, even having drawn her ears and earrings to a fine T. "I-I-It is very beautiful, thank you Luz." The witchling was blushing a deep rouge from her ears to her collarbone.It was quiet for a moment before Amity felt a slight itch, a need to do something - slowly moving her hand toward the bottom of her uniform, but Luz stopped her - moving Amity's hand back. "Let me help you." She husked into the jade haired girls' ear.Slowly she pushed past the rim of Amity's pants, maneuvering her hand to reach past the hem of the witchling's panties and gently pressing a single finger to her folds, watching her shiver slightly and bite her lip to suppress what could have only been a moan or a gasp.A smile crept onto Luz's lightly flushed face, the high and mighty Amity Blight was made vulnerable in mere seconds by only a single finger, how very adorable this was in Luz's opinion - but she pushed aside that fact, Amity was still wounded and probably scarred for the rest of her life by what ever was the thing that harmed her.This light and soft caress continued for a few minutes before Luz began to push two fingers inside the green haired girl, standing up and holding her steady with one arm while the other went to work on exploring Amity's cunt - her other hand traced soothing patterns into the witchlings' side, shoulder, and arm.It didn't take much to bring Amity over the edge - she started panting and gasping and moaning louder in pitch as she clutched at Luz's shirt, soon she fell over the edge and into a blissful feeling of euphoria - screaming to the highest heaven before slumping against Luz as she came down from the explosive high. "Feel better now, Blight?" Asked Luz, running her clean hand up Amity's arm to cup her cheek. "Mhm..." Was all she got in reply from the young witch.Luz tilted Amity's head up and placed a chaste kiss upon her lips as she began to pick her up. "Lets get you home." She smiled, stroking a thumb across a pale cheek. "N-No... Please don't... I don't want to go back home..." She begged, Luz was confused by this. "Why? Did something happen at home?" She asked, looking at Amity with an expression riddled with concern. "I... Get abused by my parents at home... They expect a lot from me, and I try hard to live up to their expectations but it's never good enough..." She sobbed, Luz felt a tingle run up her spine - oh she was gonna have a serious talk with Amity's parents!
  That's the end of this chapter!
  Probably should have put an abuse warning at the beginning of the chapter,
  but that would have kind of spoiled the story, wouldn't it?
  This lovely chapter goes out to a guest named 'gay'!
  I hope you all enjoyed this wholesome chapter of Amity's first time!
  Remember to comment, kudos if you haven't already, and stay tuned!
