                                                    On Borrowed TimeJamie/Claire Modern AU:The story of Claire Beauchamp, a feminist studies scholar and J.A.M.M Fraser, a playwright, spanning over a period of ten years between Cambridge, MA and Edinburgh, Scotland.As always, my gratitude goes to @notevenjokingfic for taking the time to provide invaluable suggestions.There shouldn‚Äôt be a formating issue on desktop but it is wonky with tumblr on mobile. I am obsessed with formatting because it is part of the storytelling. TeaserPrologue‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Chapter 1 Edinburgh, Scotland 7 years agoScotland. Alba. The earthly dwelling of Gods. Of visible and tangible divinity.Legends, superstitions, and folklore. S√¨thichean. Buidsichean. Kelpie. Brollachan. Selkie. Lusting. Roaming. Searching. Waiting. Betwixt worlds, neither here, nor there.Beanntan. Lochan. Tr√†ighean. Glinn. Aibhnichean. Alba‚Äôs majestic landscape. Transporting souls into a spiritual realm. Loosening tongues into poetry. Healing. Ritualizing. Transforming. Rebirthing of the self.The past is intricately woven into the present, written into every brick and stone, a reminder that we live in the memory of history, reconstituting history as we encounter the present. If Scotland is magical, Edinburgh, with its classic architecture, narrow streets, hidden church yards, and passageways, is as romantic as it is adventurous. It is a city that sparks the imagination, emboldens the spirit, and dares the lonely heart to love.It is in this city that I, Claire Beauchamp, a British scholar, met J.A.M.M Fraser, the beloved playwright of modern Scotland. It is only fitting that Edinburgh‚Äîknown since the 18th century as a ‚ÄúCity of Letters‚Äù and synonymous with Arthur Conan Doyle, Robert Burns, Walter Scott, Muriel Spark, Naomi Mitchison, and JK Rowling‚Äîbears witness to the meeting of souls, a chance encounter that irrevocably changed the course of two lives.Jamie.  Jamie Fraser.  James Alexander Malcolm Mackenzie Fraser.The playwright. Correction. The beloved playwright of Scotland.  Edinburgh‚Äôs son. Local-boy-made-good.  After a decade of experiences in global theater scenes‚ÄîNew York, Toronto, Tokyo, Athens, Melbourne, Buenos Aires and Subotica‚ÄîJamie returned to Edinburgh, established his own theatrical production company (becoming a playwright-producer in the process), procured a space in an abandoned historical building, and dedicated his life to breathing new vision into the arts and culture of his hometown.He was beautiful and graceful.  Over six feet tall. Broad in proportion. Shoulder length curly reddish mane, a riot of blazing autumnal colors come alive.   Slanted blue eyes. Generous wide mouth. High cheekbones. Courtesy of his Viking forefathers.  Assertive, but without the arrogance of his species.  Perceptive, but without the liability that renders him a threat to masculine ethos.  This is a man who knows his worth.The body of a warrior.  The mind of an intellectual.  The upbringing of a gentleman.  The soul of a barbarian.He is still in me.My warrior.  My intellectual.  My gentleman.  My barbarian.  Mine.Was he ever?Will the haunting never cease?The familiarity.  Captivating. Spellbinding. Ethereal.  Of knowing someone.  Of recognizing someone.  Such a recognition, of being in the know, made words superfluous.Disquieting me. Disquieting him.  Disquieting us.  We who weave words for a living.A practical academic, I do not believe in fate, soulmates, and forever.  Words absent from my existence. Untested meaning-making. He breathed life into them.  He upended the core of my being.  The scaffolding that upholds Claire Beauchamp.The familiarity disassembles me.The familiarity.  A warning.  I flouted it. I rendered my heart vulnerable.  And my heart betrayed me.He is still in me.Chapter 2

                                                                        Hey!! Hope you‚Äôre well:) I had a question regarding the Outlander series, it seems that you‚Äôve read the books and I wanted to ask about Fergus and Jamie‚Äôs relationship. Is it better than what is portrayed in the show? Is it significant? We are only shown a minimal amount and it saddens me bc Jamie has practically raised him as his own. And I hate myself for not reading the books first (I‚Äôve started and love them so much!!) but I was just curious. Thanks in advance!! Take care :) 
                                                                    Let‚Äôs put it this way - the adaptation has proven problematic after S1 (maybe even towards the end where we didn‚Äôt get the important cave-healing scene). As for Jamie and Fergus - these two have a sweet and respectful relationship and it‚Äôs better in the books. Same goes for Jamie and Bree - their relationship is nothing like the show version. They had issues, which they managed and worked through in a generative manner. Book Bree is not as soulless as show Bree.
