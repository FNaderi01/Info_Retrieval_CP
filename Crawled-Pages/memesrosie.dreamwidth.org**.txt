(i)tonight you're invited to the premiere screening of tankley barracubrick's "the brining"starring crevalle jack nicholson and shelley dushoalbased on the acclaimed novel by american writer stephen kingmr. king has cited the reason for his absence from the premiere as "overwhelming pressure"there are dolphins who believe he could manage it and sharks who wish he would, and they all write harsh criticisms of him on their blogs;especially the ones who thought IT Chapter 2 mishandled its focal characters' traumas and was very badly editedit's noon, and a bright sky shines blue overheadand here we drift towards a sort of auditoriumwith sunlight shafting down through the kelp outsideall the brilliant little fish swimming throughout the greenglinting and gleaming and carrying (somehow) their festival pamphletsprinted especially on large lengths of seaweedsand kicks up in lazy plumesas shoals of many curiously-shaped fish and soaring rays and coiling eelsscuttling crabs and bouncing seahorsesand a crooning pod of long-traveled sperm whalescrowd to watch unassuming shelley dushoal with her fin around young danny, old grizzled crevalle jack, and ghastly barracubrick wearing a predatory grinas they make their way down the blue carpet towards the glowing theatre mouth to beginyou yourself could be watching this parade;one of a thousand rainbow wrasseone in a fever of stingray on the wingor one curious diver who thinks he's dreaming some beautiful dream...(ii)to draw a true performance from the professional actor the director creates a environment of horrible stresshe treats her differently to the others, he isolates herher makes her act a single scene a hundred and twenty seven timesuntil she presents him with clumps of her hairand has broken herself into little pieces for his visionprecious china scattered on the ocean floormaybe the barracuda didn't terrorise shelley so badly her scales started to fall offso that she'd present to him a dull dead pile and say "look,you drew these from me too", before he eats her upand maybe the experience wasn't "almost unbearable, butfrom other points of view...really very nice.I suppose."--thank you for reading!!as with the two other poems I've posted here this is not 'finished' but it is finished for now, I guess. to reiterate what I tweeted while I was writing this: my social worker (whose name is also shelley, and isn't that wonderful? when I came up with "the brining" I wasn't thinking about that at all) inspired me to write this during our session on Monday just gone. I told her about a time a stingray drifted past me as I was exiting the ocean on a little swimming jaunt with my ex-boyfriend. we talked about how stingrays are very smart, and I joked that they're probably smarter than me, and she said stingrays don't run a film blog, and I said well maybe that one does! imagine a stingray composing a film review on a typewriter. somehow that turned into imagining a great underwater film festival, and that's how this poem came to be; because she asked me to write about it. so I did!so I wrote this for shelley, and I wrote it for shelley too. a lot of the later verses have lines drawn from descriptions of shelley (duvall)'s experience filming "the shining" - she did present her hair to stanley kubrick after it started to fall out due to the stress he caused her. she did say that filming was "almost unbearable". and roger ebert did call her "precious china." shelley duvall is the first actor to come to mind when I think of performers mistreated by their directors. it makes me angry because we know the traumatic experience doesn't necessarily make for a better performance. the fish thing is really just... dressing. it's an image I like. it lends peace to a really sad and tough subject.please let me know what you think, or don't. I'm honestly not looking for stylistic criticisms but feel free to make comments on anything/everything. I will read this to myself aloud at a later date to see how it sounds...

tw: sexual assault.a rant poem I wrote today.Sunny little room full of brochures and patterned throw cushions  My legs cross uncomfortably and my hands are sweating and I run them through my hair like I’m adjusting a safety blanket  All grief is really rage, I say  She – seeing me sitting there like I’m melting bit by bit on the inside – nods because she knew this already  But I explain it anyway     We get angry when things are taken away from us (that’s grief over people and things)  We get mad when things don’t go the way we want (that’s the grief of expectations)  And we feel rage when our consent is violated (that’s the grief of loss of autonomy)  Lots of people I wish I could explain this to  In a nice little room full of brochures and throw cushions  Water on the side table     I get angry, say I wish I could have kicked his shins for daring to go there    My waist is so personal to me  It connects other bits I hold dear  My hips and legs  Arms and breasts  I like to hold onto it when I’m feeling insecure  But there’s this pleased expression on his face as though he’s achieved something really worth noting  I’m not fit for that, I want to say  Did he repurpose my body just so he could caress it  Do I have to recalibrate my edges from hard to soft again once this is done  See if I can cut him on the way out  My skin is crawling and I’m trying to sidle away while he slithers closer  Every shift in a person’s body is a message and I’m speaking loud and clear  So why isn’t this very obvious hint working?  Just another stupid-looking fuck in a yellow jacket  Who never learned the rules  Or knows them and doesn’t care     But that was the third time  The first time I was eleven years old, baking something in a food tech class  I felt a quick pinch on my left butt cheek and I turned to see Joseph (real name, by the way) looking too intently at the dough he was meant to be kneading  Not the dough he wasn’t meant to be kneading, but I knew in my heart and still know now that I didn’t imagine shit  I’m certain I said something that time  Something really pointed and sure of myself like “Did you just…?” or “What did you…?”  Some strange little part of me that didn’t know any better thought it was kinda cool he’d given me the attention     The second time I was twenty-seven  Left my body behind the moment he shoved his hand down the back of my trousers  Full bar, bouncers on the door, my friends just over the other side of the table  Anyone looking on might’ve thought we were a couple getting overly familiar in public  But I’d never met him before that night and I was horrified  When I came to he was still acting like he belonged, and again I wish and wish I could have done something more obvious than rip his wandering hand away and tell him to stop  Do something really nasty with that beer jug  Utilise the sharp elbows I’ve often been told I have  Grow wings, talons, pick him up and drop him in the freezing harbour  He’d be soaking wet and spluttering  Did I ask if he can swim?     He has the same name as my father and I hate him for that  Hate him for denying it ever happened  For saying it doesn’t sound like him  Hate him for going to the police station even though I asked for that  Hate him for telling them all the same bullshit he had his girlfriend tell me  My anger bangs about inside my skull and yeah, it’s fucking unfair that I can’t transform into a giant bird woman and lay waste to this entirely  Beat my wings until the air heats and shimmers and I fold myself up, dive beak-first into the harbour where I find him still floundering  And drive us both to the bottom   Make my trauma present in his life  Grow feathers around my waist  Sit in a too-bright room full of brochures and throw cushions  Water on the side table  Crying because the rage inside me has nowhere to go

I love it when the light sits on you just rightAug. 16th, 2020 09:35 pm
a list of Things!!on friday we had a very fun nerdy quiz over zoom with a bunch of teams scattered through NZ, australia and the USA, all of them friends of vic's. we came 3rd out of 11 teams after a round 10 tiebreaker (the question was "what were the lottery numbers in LOST" and we answered easy peasy. I got a wee bit drunk on beer and gin &amp; tonics and went to bed around 12.30, vic stayed over which meant plenty of morning cuddles, and I didn't have much of a hangover on saturday which was great! the drag show I was gonna go to on sat night got postphoned to late september :/ my eyebrow appointment also got moved to next saturday, so all I did yesterday was go visit my sister and her baby boy. I spent a few hours there just chatting and getting caught up. my nephew snoozed in my arms and it was so wonderful! he's nearly 6 weeks old now and has grown 4cm since his birth, his eyes are fully open and he makes the funniest little noises. my sister is doing well too although she's stressed about her return to work in 6 months - going back to work and trying to find daycare for arthur would be much more expensive than remaining a stay-at-home mum and going on a single parent benefit. the main problem is those benefits are very hard to come off of without help.this morning I got up before 8 (woah), got ready and went for a nice 50-min walk up the hill and down through one of the neighbouring suburbs. didn't die on the hill which takes about 15 mins to walk up at a slowish but steady pace then was smooth sailing from there. I've really missed my morning walks and I'm glad this weekend wasn't so busy that I had to skip having one again. ideally I would have gone for one yesterday too but I just wasn't feelin it.around midday today chrissy and i went over to vic &amp; alannah's place and spent a while (from 12.30 or so til 6ish?) gluing rhinestones onto costumes for another upcoming drag show (not the one that got postphoned). I got to do some more work on a lovely pink tulip hat which I'm very very proud of! the body of it had been done already (mostly by myself but also a bit by luke) so today I worked on the yellow stems attached on the inside. when I showed vic she said it was exactly as she had envisioned it!! which is probably the highest praise I've had on my bedazzlements. I'm definitely getting better at it :') I also worked on a pair of lilac satin shorts which wasn't really as exciting - sparsely placed random rhinestones all over, all in one colour. that one took ages and wasn't as fun as the hat, which was a bit more challenging.now I'm home and about to go to bed ready for another week of work! I'm considering cancelling on luke for tomorrow evening cause there's some stuff I need to get done and I'm also kinda tired and stuff but we will see... none of my other plans for this week have changed and I may now also be staying at vic's on saturday to have a date/help with more costuming stuff. I've gotta be very careful not to get overwhelmed.in less awesome news I'm still very angry at duncan. tomorrow it'll have been 7 weeks since he asked me not to talk to him. I had another rant at chrissy in the car on the way to vic's today, mostly about how his expectations of me have ruined our friendship of late and how bloody unfair it all is. I'm a bit bolstered by everyone I've talked to about it being genuinely supportive of me (but not to the point where my own mistakes are excused). wish i knew what to do. wish i knew what he's been thinking.I hope this week is good to me. as much as I would have liked some time off work I'm very very glad we're not in another lockdown right now. really didn't want to have to cancel so many plans. would've missed vic and luke so so much. much better this way. fingers crossed the latest outbreak is contained and can be properly monitored and controlled! the source is still unknown which is a bit ://okay, goodnight! if you're reading this I love you &lt;3

a convulsion of honesty bought me to life (when i thought i was gone)Aug. 6th, 2020 01:32 pm
tw sexual assaulton Tuesday last week I had my first appointment with a social worker from the organisation which has been supporting me following my assault, and it was... honestly really, really good. I did cry a bit (I don't always cry when talking about it now, but when I get into the deeper emotions - the anger, the sadness - it wells up and out of my control) but the social worker was so kind and gentle and understanding with me and it was just lovely. I've had one more appointment since then and I have another next Tuesday.of course things are looking a little uncertain now with New Zealand's first community-transmitted COVID cases in 100+ days. we should find out tomorrow at 4 (is currently 3pm Thursday 13th) whether we'll be moving up alert levels. I'm really worried about it. I've been fitting so much social stuff in since the last lockdown ended that I think the shock of not being able to do anything a second time around would be even more shocking than it was the first time. Vic was meant to come around tonight (not to see me but to play video games with Jimmy) but they decided to have games at her place instead, so tonight will be a quiet one for me - maybe a movie or two, maybe a bit of Bloodborne, we will see... I'll see her tomorrow for a quiz night at my house but what if that's the last time for a little while?? I also have plans with Luke on Monday that I'd have to cancel... plans to see a drag show on Saturday with Chrissy, a feminist poetry club show and a comedy show to go to next week, a friend movie date next Sunday... lots. Lots and lots and lots.I've been a lot better this past week (after weeks of terrible sleep and bad brain feelings), partly due to my social worker and partly due to my friends continuously supporting me and showing me they're there for me. I have very little to complain about, really :')I guess a lot has been happening... I just can't think of what to write! Maybe I'll write another, longer post soon but for now here's this.

i get knocked down (but i get up again)Aug. 3rd, 2020 08:58 pm
tw. sex, sexual assault.i've come here to write a new post so many times in the last few weeks. i feel like i have so, so much to say but very little ability to say it; i don't know if that's because i don't fully understand my own feelings on a lot of stuff that's happened lately, or if i'm just not ready to share it all... i guess i'll just start typing and see what comes out.i met a friend (amy) for drinks on friday -- she's a long-term friend of my ex boyfriend (duncan). i told her about a lot of stuff that's been bothering me. some of it was in open opposition to the way duncan's been treating me (i.e. told me on june 29th that i give him anxiety and he doesn't want to talk to me for a while) and honestly she had a lot of insight into why he's been acting this way. apparently he wants some cute dependent gf who'll sit on his lap at parties and make him feel like a manly man. apparently i'm too independent and it was never going to work. apparently. i don't know how much of it really applies but amy has known him a really long time, and it kinda fits...i also told her about the guy who sexually assaulted me and that two of our mutual friends unfollowed me on insta, and she got very angry that these women decided not to ask me about the situation before doing that. basically, amy is great, and the talk really helped. partially it helped me realise what i have to do r.e. these so-called friends, which is let it go for now and not confront them with hostility, because i may get a chance to talk to them properly at some point. amy also reassured me that duncan will probably eventually come around. she said this silence actually shows growth on his part and it means he's taking care of himself by taking time to figure shit out. i can only hope!speaking of the asshole who felt me up: i finally got up the nerve to ask police to speak to him, and to put it on his permanent record. i'm not pressing charges, but it's there in case anyone else makes a complaint. what was holding me back was in fact the two women who have apparently made up their minds about me already. what they did made me so angry... i was also pushed a bit by a doctor i spoke to a couple of weeks ago. i said i was going through the process of reporting him and she said "good, make sure he doesn't do it to anyone else" (not knowing the severity of the offense or what stage of reporting him i was at) and i thought... i've been dragging my heels on this. but he really did that to me. and he really deserves to get some shit for it.cause yeah, that night was the beginning of a downhill spiral for me. two days later i called into work sick and spoke to his girlfriend on the phone (for 3 minutes). i cried hysterically. i called a help line. i took a walk and it kind of helped.but since then i haven't been as happy, i slip into sadness more easily, i've not been sleeping as well, and i've been pretty harsh on myself about it all. i've had a lot of support from people in my life but it's not been as stable as it was before. i feel like i've had the rug pulled out from under me.then on saturday night i slept with a guy i probably shouldn't have slept with, and part of it was unprotected, and yeah i'm kinda freaked out... now i have to tell luke i had unprotected sex and i hope he's not too disappointed in me. i'll get tested in a couple weeks (recommended period of time before testing) but til then i'll probably have to abstain. bollocks.in better news, my shitty flatmate is moving out this friday, and in even betterer news we found someone cool to take his room! chrissy's cousin contacted her shortly after the ad went up asking if he could see the place. i'm relieved because i really didn't want to have to live with a stranger (i mean, i don't know mike but chrissy does, so), and the timing has been very good.i'm also so so in love! vic and i are doing really really well, we have such amazing chemistry and trust in each other, i feel so like myself when i'm around her and she tells me often how much i mean to her. we said the big I Love You a couple of weeks ago and now we say it all the time :') I also just say it more in general - to chrissy, to alannah, to jimmy... they're all such good people. vic makes me want to write some very gay poetry, i tell ya what.so coming up this week... hm. tues (tomorrow) i'm going to talk to a social worker about the assault, wednesday luke and i have a date, thursday i'm seeing vic and sleeping over at her place so she can drive me to work on friday :') friday after work we're having drinks to discuss the book club book (only 4/7 of us have read it so that'll be interesting!). saturday i can't quite remember what's going on but i'm sure there's something (always is).tomorrow i might think of more to write about. for now i'm going to bed!

content warning: just a bit NSFW.1.i figure i’m going to miss the cat because she’s so smallshe follows me through the house, singingand i feel the delicate bones of her fragile cat skull under a thin layer of fur and skinadmirable that she would have such trust in me, being so little2.she’s pressing her body into mine oh god --i feel the soft warmth of her breasts and the sharp edges of her hips, and she won’t stop smiling at meand i never want her to stop smiling for methe next morning she tells me her hands miss mine. i want to ask her to crush me like an ocean swell.

I know that I'll be happier, and I know you will tooApr. 11th, 2020 08:05 pm
decided to try and post something positive, to note down some good in case I need to read and remind myself later! I suppose I haven't been doing too badly these last couple days, but all the same I like thinking about good things that happened and writing about them. while walking this morning I was looking at the trees and the hills in the distance and at the sunlight shining off of everything and I wrote this haiku in my head (I wasn't intending to share but thought I may as well)white sunlight glitters off of every perfect leafducks follow me homeI love seeing so many birds out and about, and all the quiet streets and the people walking their dogs. I usually go out between 7am and 8am and get home by 9. I've had this routine the last week of waking up to an alarm, going for my walk, coming home to shower and have breakfast, then relaxing in my room for a while watching movies. sometimes that's all I do all day, and some days I go to get groceries or I play sea of thieves with my friends over discord, and sometimes I play magic the gathering with jimmy or just sit outside with chrissy and chat about everything that's happening. it's hard to say I feel calm even with everything going on, but I do. I get weekly phonecalls from my manager to catch up but otherwise I don't think about work. I just focus on my little bubble and on keeping myself and everyone around me safe.today I went to the supermarket and when I got inside to sign in I pumped way too much hand sanitiser out of the bottle and was frantically trying to get my skin to absorb it, but it started to foam up like soap and leave a sticky film. so I picked up the pen between finger and thumb, wrote my name and number very wonkily on the sheet, and went inside to grab a basket and get a tissue out of my bag so I could wipe as much of the stuff still sitting on my hands away. it was annoying at the time but it amuses me now.today also I watched cosmopolis with my friend sophie. it was hard to grasp at times but I really enjoyed it, especially having sophie's commentary on discord to help me, as she's seen it many times and counts it as one of her favourites.besides this I've not interacted much with others today. james is writing a killzone one-shot, and chrissy and nate have been in their rooms playing minecraft all day. tomorrow I think we might play nemesis over tabletop sim, or maybe jimmy and I will play MTG again. I really hope it's a sunny day so I can take a longer walk! today was quite nice but yesterday and thursday were so windy and cold that it cut my time a bit short. I usually try to push myself to walk for a bit longer than I really want to, or to intentionally take unfamiliar detours to extend my time (it's hard to get lost around here, luckily!) but I didn't do that on those days. I do love how often people will smile and wave and say hello, though! the other day a young mum pushing a stroller gave me the brightest smile and said hello and it lifted my spirits a lot. yesterday I saw the same lady and her dog doing a loop opposite to mine twice, and both times we greeted one another. I'll often get more perfunctory, curt greetings from older men especially, and I appreciate those just as much.now I know I said I'd be positive in this post but I'm starting to feel the disconnect from my other irl friends very strongly now. I imagine myself hugging all of them and it makes me emotional. I've not talked to Luke in a little while, and I wonder if he's wondering how I'm feeling. I suppose if I don't hear from him tomorrow I'll send him something just to say I'm thinking of him.I suppose all those post-lockdown hugs will have to be extra potent to make up for time spent apart, huh!well, I've no idea how to really end this! hope you're all staying safe. much love &lt;3

this decade in quick review (books, films, games, albums, etc)Dec. 31st, 2019 01:45 pm
I have been wanting to write a longer in-depth post about all my favourites from this decade, but I don't think that's going to end up happening so here are a few quick top 5s and 10s instead (none of them will be in any particular order). thanks in advance for reading!books (top 5 read this year):since I've only read 25 books this year (and am currently working on two more) this is just a short list -days without end by sebastian barry - beautiful, heart-wrenching, romantic, violent, poetic. I'm definitely going to read more of barry's work going forward because god this book was So Much.the song of achilles by madeline miller - *presses F*mortal engines (the quadrilogy) by philip reeve - I honestly can't convey just how much I fucking loved this series. I guess part of it is because it's everything I want in YA - amazing world-building, varied and distinct characters, plotlines which span decades, journeys which take the protagonists across the world, families which would do anything for one another, tragic deaths which make you cry and stunning triumphs which make you laugh and dance around inside. hester shaw I would die for u.we have always lived in the castle by shirley jackson - I really couldn't decide between this and the haunting of hill house but in the end I think castle has the better story and the better quality of writing, although both are beautifully written and so engrossing.the left hand of darkness by ursula le guin - I had to choose a le guin book, and I think it has to be this one. le guin was one in a billion.books (top 10 read this decade, not including any of the 5 listed above):theatre of the gods by m suddain - first of all, this wild and crazy sci-fi adventure epic has a kiwi author, which is just really hecking cool. this was an incredibly fun read. I'm definitely going to give it a re-read within the next year or two.thessaly trilogy by jo walton - I swear I think about this series more than any other. it just really really stuck with me.abhorsen series by garth nix - another I need to re-read. this series is so special.chaos walking trilogy by patrick ness - ness might be my favourite author of all time? his books are consistently just extremely good.sailor song by ken kesey - this might seem like kind of a weird choice but just. trust me. this book rules.imperial radch trilogy by ann leckie - this series is the reason I got more heavily into sci-fi within the last few years... I've never read anything like it.catch-22 by joseph heller - in my top 5 since I was 14, babey!!the broken earth trilogy by n.k jemisin - however much renown jemisin has for this series, she deserves infinitely more. just incredible.percy jackson / heroes of olympus by rick riordan - yupchildren of time by adrian tchaikovsky - this was the biggest surprise this past decade. I never expected to love a book about spiders in space so much. I'm eagerly awaiting the release of the sequel in nz in a few months.film (top 15 first-time watches this decade)calvarythe devil's backbonetremorscome and seeprincess mononokeSPL 2: a time for consequencesjohn wickpan's labyrinthparasitethe pianobrickinterstellareastern promisesinto the spider-versecollateralalbums (top this decade)age of adz by sufjan stevenscarrie and lowell by sufjan stevenstidal by fiona appleextraordinary machine by fiona applethe idler wheel... by fiona applegrace by jeff buckleydivers by joanna newsomare you serious by andrew birdwhen we all fall asleep, where do we go? by billie eilishbe the cowboy by mitskilush by mitskipuberty 2 by mitskibury me at makeout creek by mitskilove yourself: answer by btsbrother act by BTOBwas it even real? by olivia obrienshallow bed by dry the river'the story of light' epilogue by shineeall hour cymbals by yeasayeran awesome wave by alt-jrelaxer by alt-jthe execution of all things by rilo kileythe temper trap (self-titled)play with fire by kindo (previously the reign of kindo)parachutes by coldplayhelplessness blues by fleet foxesthere are more but I'm going to stop here! once I got going it was very hard to stop.games (top this decade)dishonored 2bioshocktransistortomb raider 2013metal gear solid III: snake eatereasy!
