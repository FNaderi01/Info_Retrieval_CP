    Summary
      “You need to go to the hospital.” the EMT repeated patiently to Klaus. “I’m not going to the hospi-“ Diego threw another spoon at his face, irritated he was going to have to pick them up later. Klaus glanced up to glower at him, but fiercely jumped at the nothingness to Diego’s side.”Jesus Diego, he looks like a goddamn colander!” Klaus exclaimed, violently disgusted by the sheer amount of stab wounds in this ghost.

    Summary
      Irritated by Klaus constantly burying his head in the sand, Ben huffed. “If you share needles or have unprotected sex it would be recommended.” the rehab doctor grumbled. His brother looked to the ground sheepishly. “What if I’d rather not know?” Klaus mumbled. “Then you could die a very painful, preventable death.” the doctor stated with disinterest. “Sign me up!” Klaus giggled. Ben fiercely marched from the room, deeply offended by how much Klaus took life for granted. All Ben wanted was to be alive.
