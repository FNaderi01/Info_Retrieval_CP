    Summary
    Wesker huffed impatiently, placing his hands on the desk and leaning in a little closer, his voice dropped to a low, threatening rumble. “Get it done.” Chris shivered, but nodded fervently. “I want to see it on my desk within in an hour, and don’t let that girlfriend of yours distract you.”
Or: four times Wesker gets jealous and one time Chris does.

    Summary
  What was that? Are you shy, Chris?” Wesker teasing him was something he never wanted to happen again.
  Chris eyed Wesker through his glasses, squaring up his shoulders almost like he was bracing himself for the humiliation. “I wasn’t exaggerating, your hair is always nice.”
Chris goes out on a mission, and him and Wesker have a few moments. Mostly a gen fic.

To this end, Excella Giovanne has brought in her two best operatives, Raymond Vester and Jessica Sherawat, to take Chris off Wesker's hands and remind him of what he really wants.Jill Valentine is having none of this nonsense and is only here to get Chris back and, possibly, shoot Wesker in the face with a rocket launcher. Anyone else in the blast radius who are trying to hurt Chris is just lucky she's not REALLY upset.
