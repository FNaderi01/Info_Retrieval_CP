You saved my life, Barry!” He grins ear to ear, and Simon exhales nervously with a small smile as Nathan laughs almost hysterically.

    Summary
      “Why is everybody taking my relationship status so personally? Can’t I be fine with being single?” Buck said.“Hey, you don’t have to say yes, be sad and alone if that’s what you want,” Josh replied. “But, I’m just saying. I’ve seen photos and this guy is volcanic levels of hot. Also, single dad, super cute kid. Saves lives for a living like you. I think you should give it a go.”(the one where Buck and Eddie accidentally get set up on a blind date with each other, and everything snowballs from there)

    Summary
      This guy, whoever he is, is swaying where he stands ten feet in front of the truck. Looks like he just barely made it out of a doomsday machine in one piece- but that’s not giving him much credit. The white t-shirt and sweatpants he’s wearing hang loosely on him and his feet are bare. Just from watching him stand Eddie can tell that he’s favoring his right leg over his left. His head swivels in the direction of Eddie’s car, but the man just blinks owlishly; like he’s not registering any of this.     What the hell is going on?Eddie gets out of his car as his firefighter instincts start to kick in, already asking, “Hey, man- are you okay?”ORInspired by this tumblr post from whumpster-dumpster: Whumpee has escaped from Whumper, dazed and wounded. As they try to make it home they get weaker and weaker, finally collapsing in the middle of the street. As they slip out of consciousness the last thing they’re aware of are headlights racing toward them and screeching brakes. Do they get hit or does the car stop in time? More importantly, whose car is it, a stranger’s, an ally’s or an enemy’s?
