    Summary
      “Barry!” Cisco chided, narrowed his eyes. He felt his eye twitch as the other shrugged off his irritation. “We agreed that you and Len would avoid us when we were in here.”“And during sex.”Both Cisco and Barry turned to see another transparent man sitting up on the bathroom counter, leaning back against the mirror behind him. Or, poor Cisco just wants to shower but his ghostly roommates (the ones the realtor NEGLECTED TO MENTION when he and his new husband bought their house!!) won't let him have one in pease.

    Summary
      “Where did you get a stapler?” Hartley asked as he observed the box of things Cisco brought to use as projectiles.
“You know those offices on the third floor?” Cisco asked. “They were pretty much abandoned after the accelerator. Some people didn’t bother coming in to clear out their stuff.”
Acting as Hartley’s training partner wasn’t at the top of Cisco’s to-do list, especially when the only area they had to work in was a warehouse with no heating. But there was no way Cisco was going to pass up the opportunity to throw heavy office supplies at Hartley to blast with sound waves.
The only thing that could make this better could be coffee, a better understanding of ASL, and if Cisco knew what tv show Hartley was referencing.

    Summary
      On the way to the Greyhound bus station, Cisco gets a little lost.  He's contending with multiple timelines worth of memories, the bus station isn't where he remembers it to be (or is it?), and he's just about at the point of wishing Mar Novu was alive again just so that he could punch the smug jerk in the face.  And that's when Hartley shows up, in full Piper gear, and Cisco's ready to just nope his way back to his apartment to start this day over again.(Or the one where Hartley invites himself along on Cisco's road trip while Cisco figures that some days this might as well just happen.)

    Summary
      “Seriously, I could make you a Cisco Ramon special.”
“Tell me more,” Hartley said in a flirty tone he only used to tease Cisco.
Fixing Hartley with as blank an expression as he could muster, Cisco stated, “I meant a suit.”
“I’m sure you did.”
It had only been a couple weeks since Cisco started working with Hartley as the Pied Piper to make Central City a safer place overall, and things were going surprisingly well. Working with Hartley to find and expose corruption was way more interesting than Cisco initially thought it would be. 
Now if Hartley would wear a damn mask to protect his identity and maybe let Cisco design him a proper suit, Pied Piper might be able to make a lasting impression.

    Summary
      Cisco tried to push away the feeling of dread churning inside of him as he watched the image of the Reverse Flash, desperate to find a flaw in the only explanation he could think of. Desperate to find something other than that his boss, the one person who had mentored him, given him a home when he needed it, and believed in him from the beginning was actually a homicidal maniac.
So when he heard the voice, he didn’t want to turn around.
“Oh I’m not like the Flash at all.”
“Some would say I’m the Reverse.” 
He could feel his heart drop and the blood thunder in his ears as he turned, seeing the one person who had become more like family than his own blood standing in the doorway.
Standing? 
He could feel tears welling up as he stared at the man, feeling a sense of empty betrayal. How much had been hidden from him? Did he even know anything about the man who he had devoted his work to for years, defending him from anyone who dared to criticize him?

    Summary
      When Barry went back in time to learn the secret of tachyon enhancement from Eobard Thawne, he also drastically altered the course of Hartley Rathaway's life. His decision also caused a ripple effect throughout the timeline. Lives will be changed, lives will be saved. The full magnitude of the consequences will not become clear until much later. On the plus side, Hartley's chance to redeem himself has also afforded him a second chance with a certain, gorgeous engineer. If only it weren't for the threat of two of his ex bosses!

    Summary
      Well, Calvin really hadn't expected it. He was going through the Multiverse, watching everything happen from a distance, but he hadn't seen that wormhole open. Now he had to deal with a really strange uncanon version of the Flash. Not that he was complaining.

    Summary
      It's not until he's getting the tour of Star Labs that Cisco considers he's just about the only person of colour in the building. Doctor Wells seems intent on introducing him to every other scientist on staff, some of the most well known minds in Central City, and every single one of them is white. It's exhausting.-the challenges cisco faces as a latino scientist

    Summary
      Getting lost in the Speed Force might have given Barry a new outlook on life, but it's back to the same old routine with even more crime to stop, occassional drop ins from Lisa Snart's Rogues ready to stir up trouble, and one big bad determined to cause problems.But this time it's not a speedster, and it'll take smarts to defeat the Thinker, not that S.T.A.R. Labs is short on them. And they have a whole new set of allies who can help. Providing they can keep them alive. (Part 11/12)
