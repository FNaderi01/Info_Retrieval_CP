                                                I wish Claire and Lady Isobel had met; I‚Äôm sure they would have hit it off together¬† (writers of ‚Äòfluffy‚Äô fanfic, help me out: a menage a trois perhaps? ). Maybe in Jamaica, or in the Colonies.¬†I‚Äôm sure Bree would have loved to meet Adawehi and learn about Native American customs and lore¬†Bree might have found Dougal a bit intimidating; but he‚Äôd have made a great Frontiersman and Freedom FighterRupert and Angus: These two are sorely missed. They‚Äôd have loved Bree: and would have been great on the FrontierWould they two red-heads have got on well? They‚Äôd have had fun talking about the Beatles, and adjusting to life in the 18th Century. Geillis was a bit hippy-dippyAnd wouldn‚Äôt it have been great if Louise de la Tour had been able to travel to America with her child and stay with Jamie and Claire in their cabin? Oh la la‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.and she could have made out with Uncle Dougaland whatever happened to Wee Hamish? Did he join a Scottish regiment under King George, and fight the French at Quebec or Ticonderoga? Or would he have joined cousin Jamie in North Carolina?¬†#Outlander characters I loved
