    Summary
      Sometimes, not every love story needs to be a sprawling epic of romance, adventure, and daring. Not every love story needs to be a drama filled with passion and bated breath. Sometimes, love can be simple and clean and pure, and no words describe Marcy Wu better than those.

    Summary
      This was too far, way, way too far. She felt like she was going to be sick, there was no way this had happened, right? No way she’d become so invested in this stupid little game of hers and Anne’s that she’d actually… actually…Anne’s body shook- no, twitched- violently. A sob pulling at her ribcage before cutting off in a pained wheeze. Sasha could only stare at the blood pooling beneath her feet. She took a step forward, hand raised tentatively. “A-Anne…. I-I-” __In which Sasha takes it too far.
