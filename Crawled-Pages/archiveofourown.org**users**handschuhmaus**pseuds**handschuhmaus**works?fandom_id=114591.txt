    Summary
      Palpatine wakes up in an army tent (nicknamed "The Swamp" by its occupants) in 1950s war-torn Korea. Hawkeye comes to in a lavishly decorated office on Coruscant. 
One of them will change the other's world, the other is more apt to be changed by it.
(And then there's this intentionally infuriating general of some sort visiting the 4077th, and that one guy who "accidentally" crossed into North Korea trying to get some kimchi...)

    Summary
      Crowley does a good deed. Or possibly a bad one. Ethics aside, what any bibliophiles would approve of was him saving some books from destruction.
