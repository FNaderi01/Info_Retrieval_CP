    Summary
      If you have found this story and not read the first installment or the second, please do so.  The existing plot points, characters and establishment of their lives will matter.  We are entering a time in Queen's history that contains many triumphs but will soon lead to a road of tragedy and loss.  The band is at the top of their game as they begin recording their next album.  But the strain of 10 years together is starting to show.  Creative tension and the need to keep up with the pace of a rock &amp; roll lifestyle will begin to create problems.  A new darkness is emerging in the world that will have an enormous impact on all their lives.  It will threaten everything that matters and cause each of them to react in ways they could never imagine.  Will the group survive all the turmoil?  Will Brian and Roger survive the stresses placed on their relationship?  And - what will be the final thing that makes Brian and Roger willing to reveal their most sacred secret to the world?  I hope you will join me for a dramatic journey through the 80's...one filled with love, laughter, tears, mistakes, forgiveness and remembering what matters most...friends will be friends...right til the end.

    Summary
      Queen accompany Mott the Hoople on their first tour of America. As far as the world knows Jim Hutton is in attendance as Freddie’s personal assistant, but as all readers of Encounters know, Jim’s world spun off it’s axis the moment he clapped hands on our young shooting star.Encounters: Shooting Star follows the boys from dazzling city to city, exploring a new country, bright lights, enticing bars, high rises, new friends and old, but there’s a darker side – what if those amongst them have a hidden agenda? What if the greatest threat to Freddie and Jim’s love comes from within?

    Summary
      It’s the longest split-second of Brian’s life. He’s dimly aware of the crowd screaming, shocked and amused in the moment, concerned when Freddie doesn’t immediately leap back up. Brian doesn’t look at them, couldn’t care less about them; there’s a ringing in his ears that has nothing to do with the music and he’s by Freddie’s side in four strides.  “Freddie?” he whispers. “Freddie, look at me, please.”
