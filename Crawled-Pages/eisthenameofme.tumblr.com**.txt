                                This will probably just be an amalgamation of things that interest me. It may also include fragments of my writing or art. It'll probably be wierd. As you may have already guessed, I'm E. Pronouns: I'm agender and generally use they/them pronouns, but anything that doesn't imply I have a gender (including neo-pronouns, it, etc.) is fine. I'm 20.

You just feel watched by this mf. Sometimes the little shit is right there at the centre, but others the bastard is just gazing from the distance, it is CREEPY, my guys
