    Summary
      Fleeing across a war-torn Cintra on her quest to find Geralt of Rivia, Ciri finds... not Geralt. *“I want you to let me go!” She snapped, and pulled her arm from his grasp. He let her go easily. “It’s, it’s no business of yours what I am doing,” she declared, every inch royalty in her moment. It fled her the next, leaving a scared little girl in its wake. “Please, let me be.”“I can’t,” Jaskier replied instantly, and he found he meant it. “Let me help you,” he said.After a long, squint-eyed moment of suspicion, her chin thrust up defiantly.“I won’t lie on my back for you.”“Lie on your-- no,” he retched, horrified, but her face remained as it had, cagey, untrusting, jaded. “Princess, no. I want nothing so vile from you, I promise you. You must leave this place, immediately. You need accompaniment,” he pressed, even as she shook her head. “You- you need to find Geralt of Rivia!”

    Summary
      “For you!” Julian cried, shoving a fistful of weeds in Renfri’s direction, his smile wide and carefree.Renfri carefully took them in her hands that were only shaking a little bit now, smearing red onto green stems and yellow petals.Julian clambered into the bed beside her and crawled halfway onto her lap. “I got you flowers, ‘cause you’re so pretty like them!”“These aren’t flowers, they’re weeds.” Renfri told him, rolling her eyes but allowing the contact with ease. Somedays it seemed like Julian was the only person in the entire castle who wasn’t afraid of her.“They look like flowers.” He said, crinkling his nose.“They’re dandelions,” Renfri informed her brother with a tiny smile, “They grow everywhere, even places they perhaps shouldn’t. That’s why they’re a weed.”“Perhaps they’re a little like you,” She teased, “Growing in even the scariest of places with no fear.” Like a monster’s heart, she doesn’t say.“Like a superpower!” Julian gasped.Renfri separated one dandelion from the little clutch and reached out to tuck it behind a little ear. “For the stubborn hero, Jaskier.”

        once I read this I immediately accepted it as canon and reading anything else where Jaskier doesn't have a sister or music powers is just so disorienting?

    Summary
      The Arcobaleno, betrayed by their previous Sky, are always looking, always searching, always wondering. But days turn to weeks and weeks turn to months and months turn to years, and to search and have hope with no results is too painful, even for them, so they stop. They go on with their day-to-day lives, sometimes allowing themselves an illusion of hope before crushing it once more. It is when they cease to look, to search, to wonder, that is when she finds them. And so the strongest seven finally belong. And she does too.
