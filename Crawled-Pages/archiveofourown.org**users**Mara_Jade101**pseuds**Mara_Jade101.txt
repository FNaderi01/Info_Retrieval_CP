    Summary
      Bugs Meany is confused. After everything he did to make Encyclopedia Brown get in trouble, why did he feel sympathy and pity for his rival when he first learned that he had gotten kidnapped by animal smugglers?It's only after some soul-searching does he realize the truth: He is tired of living life like a criminal and he wants to change for the good.He just has to prove it. Not just to the town of Idaville, but to the boy he bullied for over six years because he was too afraid to tell him how much he reminded him of his family.

    Summary
      The Trial was just the beginning...16-year-olds Dink Duncan, Josh Pinto, and Ruth Rose Hathaway expected many things to happen to them once they turned 16. Getting kidnapped by a group of masked men outside their homes was one of them. 16-year-olds Dave Smith, Bill Robinson, and Rosa Crusoe did not expect to wake up in a school-like environment with EVERYONE staring at them. To make matters worse, the President and three other members of the Literature Club Rosa is (apparently) involved in keeps acting weird around her brother MC, Bill witnesses a classmate being stalked, Dave finds out that the school has a dark secret, and all three of them keep seeing ghosts.What is a newly formed soulmate triad to do? And why do the three ghosts want to help them figure out their soulmate bond?

"Please, you have to believe us!!!"Now 16, Dink, Josh, and Ruth Rose have finally fully recovered from the "Afton Incident" as the news is calling it, and are looking forward to a year of normalcy and the average mystery-solving along the way. Everything changes when they're blamed for a set of robberies that they KNOW they didn't commit. Now they just have to prove it in a court of law, and the only unbiased person who is capable of helping them is a man named Phoenix Wright.
