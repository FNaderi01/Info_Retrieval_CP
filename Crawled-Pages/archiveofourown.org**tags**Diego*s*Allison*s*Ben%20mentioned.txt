    No Archive Warnings ApplyNumber Five | The Boy &amp; Klaus HargreevesKlaus Hargreeves Number Five | The Boy (Umbrella Academy)Driving Five teaches Klaus how to drive Five is a good brother Brotherly Bonding Spanking (?) like a swat on the butt five is a little shit Nervousness Daddy Kink (?) Klaus calls Five "Daddy" Not Canon Compliant Diego/Allison/Ben mentioned Adopted Sibling Relationship
    Summary
      It’s a well known fact that Klaus doesn’t know how to drive and since Diego adamantly refuses to get into another vehicle with him after the ice-cream truck incident, Five decides it’s up to him to teach Klaus. Based off of Five saying “I’m the daddy here!” in Season 2. Not Season 2 compliant though.
