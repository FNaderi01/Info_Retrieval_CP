    Summary
      “But I have a spark-baffle installed. I can’t be sparked!” “Well, you don’t anymore.” Spinister said with a shrug. “Probably got yanked to make more room for explosives.”Fulcrum let out a whine and cradled his head in his hands. Of course. The sadists at Styx who reformatted him into a K-classer wouldn’t have hesitated to remove his baffle to jam a larger explosive payload into his chest. A K-con’s life expectancy was measured in days, what use did they have for birth control?

      Just because six million years of war suddenly ends doesn't mean that the story is over, especially when said story involves giant alien robots who have no idea what a government even is.

    Summary
      Soundwave knew early on he was carrying. He also knew that the safest option for both him and his sparkling was to keep its existence a secret. What he should’ve known was he could only hold this secret inside him for so long...Oh, and also the Autobot v/s Decepticon war is starting.

    Summary
      Unrelated drabbles and ficlets created from prompts given to me on Tumblr that don't quite have a home elsewhere.***Trying to make this even more obvious:As I've had it asked before - I don't take fic requests here. These ficlets are fills for prompts given to me by Tumblr users during certain times of the year that I invite people to send me ideas. There is never a guarantee I'll actually write a fill to a prompt, and there is no associated timeline with any potential fills, as I look to these when I'm lacking inspiration. However, if you are interested in a particular fanfiction request you can find more information at my dreamwidth account.

    Summary
      Sparklings aren't easy to care for. It was no understatement. Sparklings needed almost around the clock care and attention and it was hard to tell what power they inherit from their creators. But that didn't mean they were all trouble. No matter who their carrier or sire were, intresting things were bound to happen with one around.

      He turned back to the window he had been facing, staring into the pitch-black night and tried to compose himself while on the inside he was breaking apart.    This has to be, it was the only logical choice.

    Summary
      Eventually though bee broke the silence again, the storm having fled and leaving behind something that felt new and still. The air crisp and carrying every word with a heightened significance. "Hey um.. Is that offer still on the table?" Bee asked a bit meekly, his smile brighter than the full moon beaming down from overheard. Blitzwing was a bit confused and tilted his helm to the side, before his optic widened in realization.

    Summary
      Megatron sees the doom of all Cybertronians creeping upon them; a divided, dwindling species, surrounded by enemies. To cure that division, he surrenders himself to the Autobots to attain a peace available no other way. To remedy their dwindling numbers, he accepts a modification to his newest body. But Shockwave had his own plans for Megatron's role in Cybertron's recovery, and Megatron finds himself paying a higher price for Cybertron's future than he ever imagined possible. Now, Drift and Ratchet must race against time to save their dearest enemy... before Megatron, and the hope he represents, are lost forever.

    Summary
      Bumblebee didn't think his teammates hated him so much, but was Starscream right? Was he really a worthless glitch not worth anybot's time? All he ever wanted was to prove himself and show them all. Why was a Decepticon the only one willing to tell him the truth? What was this strange sensation in his spark? (I was given permission to use the idea from JazzTheTiger's comic "Nightmare")

    Summary
      Cybertron has been saved, and the reconstruction has begun. Autobots and Decepticons alike are flocking back home, ready to rebuild their restored planet. Optimus' dreams of redemption for all beings is finally coming true.
With the war finally over, Ratchet and Optimus finally get to live their fantasy of having a family. Optimus didn't anticipate the target that would be put over Ratchet's head once he became sparked.
A small band of Decepticons aren't satisfied with the way things played out. Seeking revenge and compensation, they take the sparked medic hostage, and the race begins. Optimus must juggle his Primely duties and searching for his medic while complying to the outrageous demands.
His desperation is what leads him to Megatron.
