watching in the mirror as Justin gritted his teeth, taking in what you were
wearing, a small crop top, which showed an ample amount of cleavage and a plaid
mini skirt, that you should definitely
not bend over in. “Take. It. Off.”
He spat, gesturing to your outfit.“Justin, you’re my best friend, not my father, lay off.” You
rolled your eyes and continued to loosely curl strands of your hair.“This isn’t fucking funny Y/N. Bryce and Montgomery are
going to be at this party!” Justin stalked up and down the width of your
bedroom. You rarely went to parties, but you decided to accompany Justin as he
was trying to ease himself back into the community. “Take. It. The. Fuck. Off.”
Justin demanded again, coming to a stop at the end of your bed.  Keep reading

            jealous + jeff atkins        plot : y/n is jeff’s secret girlfriend but she gets jealous when other girls talk to him and has to show everyone/and him, who’s he is word count : 1270notes : jealous!reader++++Walking into school, your eyes searched for someone in particular.  You found him with his friends, leaning again his locker surrounded by his usual group of friends. He caught your eye, quickly looking away but a smile burst onto his face. You strode past him, moving to your own group of friends. You could feel a pair of eyes on you and you knew who they belonged to. “Hey, Y/N’s here!” your best friend, Kat hollered. Your other friends all turned and smiled at you. You returned it, but furrowed your eyebrows. They were acting odd.“We have news” one of your other friends chorused.“We think Jeff might be into you. You know the one on the baseball team? Hot Jeff?” another blurted. You were stunned for a mere second before you regained your composure and laughed. “Guys, there is no way Jeff Atkins is into me” you glanced at Kat, with a sly smile on your face. Kat was the only one of your friends that knew about you and Jeff’s relationship. Kat tried to hide her smug smile, “He’s been looking at for the past few weeks and you should’ve seen how he smiled when you walked in this morning” You smacked her on the arm for feeding into this gossip and she put her hands up in surrender. “Well, I guess I’ll have to do something about that then” you winked at them playfully, making all of your friends laugh, unaware of the truth.“Oh, better act fast then because, Tracy’s on the same mission” You turned around to see a girl leaning against his locker. They were laughing about something. She was pretty, prettier than you in your opinion. You trusted Jeff, you knew he wouldn’t do anything to hurt you but you couldn’t help the overwhelming feeling of envy as you watched him openly laugh with that girl. You two had agreed to keep your relationship a secret until he got his grades up since his parents thought a relationship would distract him. But seeing him talk to that girl so freely, laughing and joking, you realized that could’ve been you instead. But you were used to this feeling so you brushed it off. “No but Tracy and Jeff would be kinda cute, I mean they’ve been working on a chemistry project together for the past weeks and they’re adorable in class” one of the girls in your circle, thought out loud. “Have they now?” you muttered. “Yeah and I reckon they would be a pretty good couple” You glared in their direction, “I bet”+“Hey Y/N, so I have this chem- ” Jeff yelped as you 
pulled him into your room by the front of his shirt, swiftly shutting the door 
behind you with your foot. You pushed him into the wall next to the 
door, pressing your body to his, trapping him between you and the wall. Jeff’s eyes widened at your position, 
looking at you questioningly with big eyes.  “Y-Y/N what’s going on?” You didn’t reply verbally, simply
 pressing your lips to his instead. He instantly reacted to the kiss, 
moving his hands to your waist, squeezing gently. You let your hand rest
 on the back of his neck while another sat on his shoulder. He mumbled something incoherent and you ignored it. You shoved 
your tongue into his mouth, but he pulled away as soon as you did. “What’s up though?” he whispered, leaning his head back onto the wall.  You dodged the question, answering with another question.“You’re okay with this aren’t you?” you responded. “Well yeah of course…” Jeff stopped for a second, gathering his words but you had already taken that opportunity. You
 untangled yourself from him and lifted his shirt over his head, You smiled slyly at the sight of his bare body. You couldn’t help but smash your lips back onto his. He accepted you for a few heavenly 
seconds before pulling away again. “No seriously, what’s going on?” Jeff asked, worry in his eyes. “Does it matter?” you panted, looking up into his eyes, getting restless.  “It does, I don’t want my girl- oh my god” You had attacked his 
neck with kisses, sucking a bit longer than necessary with each. You ran
 your hand up the dips of his toned abs, getting a groan in return. You moved up to his jaw, pecking his lips before making a path down again. You hit just the right place, near the crook of his neck, 
making Jeff moan in response. “Y/N” You smirked at this, 
trailing your hand down to his belt buckle. You pulled him closer to you
 but before you could proceed to undoing it, Jeff pulled away for the 
third time. “I’m serious, what’s going on with you? You’re not like this normally…” he muttered, breathlessly. You
 took a deep breath, you didn’t want to tell him the real reason you 
were all fired up. You hated being the typical jealous girlfriend.  At 
your silence, Jeff spoke again. “Don’t get me wrong, it’s super hot but I just want to know if there’s anything wrong and I want to help if there is” He
 tucked a piece of hair behind your ear, looking at you with those 
concerned eyes. Those adorable eyes that you fell in love with. Jeff was so different from the other jocks that he called his friends. A normal guy wouldn’t have questioned this but Jeff, being Jeff, was always thinking about your well being. “I got jealous” you muttered. You knew from the surprised look on his face that he heard you. You never really got jealous. Girls always flirted with him and you didn’t blame them.“What was that?"he asked with a cheeky grin. That little- "I got freaking jealous okay?!” And then he burst out laughing. The nerve of him. You looked away, anger bubbling in you. “Of who?” he got out in between fits of laughter. “That girl you’re doing the chemistry thing with” You finally looked back into his amused eyes.“Worried that we had chemistry?” You
 slapped his chest at the terrible pun. That’s when you finally noticed 
the red and purple marks all over his neck and collarbone. It was your 
turn to laugh now. “Well I won’t have to worry anymore” you smirked. He
 eyed you suspiciously before following your gaze. You watched as his 
eyes widened dramatically and he looked to you like a gaping fish. “Y/N,
 how the hell am I meant to cover this up? Everyone will notice!”"Perfect” BONUS“Jeff, man it’s like 500 degrees out, take that scarf off” Jess groaned. “Uh, no I’m okay” Jeff replied awkwardly. “Well, I’m getting sick of it” Marcus stated, ripping it off Jeff’s neck before he could protest’The whole group silenced. Why did Jeff have to wear a v-neck today? “Oh look who got some last night” Bryce cheered. “Aww, look at our little Jeffrey growing up. I thought you didn’t do one time things” Justin teased. Jeff had turned a bright shade of red. “Damn dude, do we know the girl? Because she’s pretty hardcore” Monty chuckled, eyeing the marks that covered a large portion of his neck and shoulder. Jeff took a deep breath, playfully glaring at you from across courtyard. You caught his gaze, laughing and winked at him. God, he loved you.

            jeff atkins: skittles        Request: “please write more jeff atkins imagines”Pairing: Jeff Atkins x ReaderWarning(s): NoneWord Count: 373Gif: @titch-the-eskibro-banditA/N: Fair amount of my own headcannons. If you want to hear some of my headcannons, lemme know! [ Read pt 1 ] [ Read pt 2 ]It was Friday night. Jeff had picked you up from your house and cruised over to the Crestmont. He played his country music, mocking the deep accents. You had the window rolled down, your hair blowing in your face.Once you arrived, Jeff had bought tickets to the new thriller in town. You linked your arm to his, feeling his warmth.“Hey Clay,” Jeff fist bumped your brother. “She’s here, safe and sound.”Clay shook his head. He got the movie packet together, which consisted of two medium sodas, a large popcorn, red vines and-“Skittles?” Jeff looked at Clay. “I thought it was just red vines?”“Well, yeah,” Clay shrugged. “But y/n likes skittles. I won’t charge for that.”You gave your brother a small smile. “Thanks Clay.”“Of course,” he nodded. “Enjoy your movie.”Jeff held the large box in one arm, and even though he struggled, he still took your hand. Once you settled down in the middle of the theater, you ripped open the bag of skittles.You poured a few into your hand. You motioned your handful to Jeff.“You want?” You offered. Jeff chuckled, taking a few colors. He dropped them in all at once. Once he swallowed his sweets, he turned to face you.“What’s your least favorite skittles flavor?” He asked, not minding his volume at all.You widened your eyes at him. You folded your lips into your mouth. When he wouldn’t look away, you whispered to him your answer. He nodded, and took the bag of skittles. He took out all the colors that you claimed were not in your palate.You furrowed your brows. “What are you doing?” You whispered. His smirked, holding the solid color in his hand.“I’m getting rid of what you don’t like,” Jeff announced. He tossed the number of skittles in his mouth, squinting his eyes. “Apparently, I don’t like them either…” He coughed.You laughed into your hand, muffling your giggles. Jeff got to the point where he had to swallow the sugary treat. He sipped his cola, clearing his throat.“I will get rid of anything you don’t like, Y/N,” Jeff spoke, his voice raspy. “Unless I hate it too, then it’s up to Clay.”

            Too Soon - Jeff Atkins Imagine        Jeff Atkins x readerRequest:
Hi i was wondering if i could request 13 reasons why imagine where the reader and Jeff have been dating for a couple months or an year…maybe have smut like they made love and then where Jeff passes away and maybe have the reader visit the grave with clay and tony to tell Jeff..that he was a dad.WARNINGS: Fluff, smut, small swearing“Atkins!” I scream when I see my boyfriend in the hallway. I jump in his arms wrap my legs around his torso and kiss him as if I didn’t see him in months when in reality is was literally two periods ago. I’m cheesy like that. We’ve been dating for over a year now, but everyday feels like we started dating yesterday. He never seizes to amaze me. He surprises me with flowers and I still get anxious and excited like a little girl when we go out on dates. He still does things like climb through my window even though my parents basically forced a key on him. He even does things like come over at 2am when I joke about being scared. He’s just the best boyfriend in the world.“Hey baby” he laughs as he kisses me back. “You ready to go”“Yes, it’s Friday and I’ve never been happier” I slide my hand in his as we walk out the school building earning a ‘bye’ or ‘what up’ from people.As we walked to my house, Jeff kept telling me corny jokes and pick-up lines he found online last night trying to make me laugh.“Babe, knock knock?”“Not another one J.”“Baaabe knock knock, come on last one I promise.”“You said that three jokes ago” I whine.“Oh. Knock knock?”“Who’s there?” I sigh.“A broken pencil” he smiles.“A broken pencil who” I sigh, already knowing the joke.“Never mind it’s poin-”“Pointless” I say as I laugh dramatically. He looks at me seriously for interrupting his corny joke. “Sorry baby, love you!” I try to kiss him the rest of the way home as he pretends to be mad at me.  As we walk in, he stills pretend to be mad when he stomps into my room and close the door. He closes me out my room. My room.“Babe really” I laugh.“Do a knock knock joke then you can come in.”“No”“Yes”“Noo babe”“Well then I’m going to go take a nap”“No!” I roll my eyes as if he can see it. “Fine babe…knock knock”“Who’s there” he cooed.“Al.” I smirk.“Al who?” “Al strip for you if you open this door” I smirk biting my lip. As soon as I said that, the door swung open and I’m met with Jeff’s lips as he pulls me inside. He shuts the door and pushes me up against it. “No need to do that” he whispers in my ear. He starts kissing and sucking on my neck and pulls up the dress I’m wearing. He slides his hands under my underwear to my butt and pulls me to him.“J-Jeff” I moan. He looks at me and bit his lip as he throws the dress off, leaving me in just my bra and panties. He scans my body as I turn my head, feeling nervous all of a sudden. He moves my head to face him and I see such admiration in his eyes.“You’re the most gorgeous girl I’ve ever laid my eyes on.” When he said that I wanted nothing more than to feel him on me. I throw my arms around his neck and hungrily kiss him. He grabs my legs and I jump on him as he moves us to the bed. He hovers over me as he deepens the kiss. He puts his hand behind my neck to pull me closer to him. He rubs my thigh up and down as he slowly peppers kisses all over my neck and chest. He’s painfully teasing and I can’t take it.“Jeff” I whisper.“Yes y/n?”“I need you” he looks at me and simply smiles.He continues to kiss my neck as he unclasp my bra. He starts sucking my breast and massaging the other as I run my hands through his hair. He does the same to the other and I’m a moaning mess.“Jeff please” I moan.“We’re almost there baby” he whispers.He kisses down my stomach and thigh slowly, never breaking his stare from me. I whine again as he comes back and goes back to sweetly kissing me. I groan from the friction of my almost bare core against his jeans and wiggle for him to get the idea. He does and pulls off his jeans and I hastily pull off his shirt.“Someone is ready” he giggles. I roll my eyes and roughly palm his member through his boxers making him grunt.“Someone is hard” I mimic smirking. He tries to keep his groans in until I full on grab him and he does a full moan. Now he’s the frantic one as he rips my underwear off of me. Literally.“Jeff!” I scream.“Sorry baby, I’ll get you another one” he smirks. He slides his hands all over my body, making me shiver.“You like that?” he asks. I nod as he slips a finger in me and goes back to kissing. I  whimper from his touch and go for his underwear. I push them down and his member springs out. He kicks them off and slides two fingers in this time. I moan into his mouth as he goes at a fast pace. I let out more moans as I start to get close.“Jeff baby, I’m abou-” when I said that, Jeff pulled his fingers away and I frown. “I want to feel you cum, not with my fingers” he smirks.He grabs a condom out his wallet from his pocket and slide it on. He gives me a look for confirmation and I nod, just wanting to feel him already. He pushes his length into me. At first it hurt, but it always does when we have sex because of his huge size. The longer he’s in me, the more I get used to it. He pushes in slowly and draws out a little. I start to moan as I connect my lips with his. As he picks up his pace, I dig my nails into his back. He hooks my legs over his shoulder and I scream a little.“Je-OH My fuck!” he’s directly hitting my g-spot and I can’t even think. I moan louder as I grab the pillow under my head, arching my back. “Fuck princess! you feel good” he moans. “H-harder J-Jeff!” He goes harder and I start almost full on screaming. As we both are climaxing, Jeff pulls out and puts me on all fours. He pushes back in and grabs my breast from behind. I lean back as he kisses my neck while pounding into me. He moans into my ear as I hold the back of his neck. I can’t control my moans and screams and neither can he. They come out louder as he hits the right spot over and over again. As we get closer, I fall onto my hands and Jeff holds my waist. He roughly rubs me with his fingers as I scream to let go of my release.“J-JEFF!” I scream.He cums shortly after I do and collapse next to me. We lay there in a comfortable silence while I rest my head on his shoulder and his arm wrapped around me. Both still out of breath, he looks over to me.“Knock knock?”“Who’s there” I laugh. “I love”“I love who?” I say, letting him finish it this time for his sake.“I love you” He smiles as he kisses me.“My corny boyfriend” I laugh.*Tomorrow Night*“You guys have been inseparable all night my gosh” Jessica drunkenly laughs. Me and Jeff look at each other and chuckle, knowing exactly why. We have been at Jessica’s party for a while now and have been sitting on the couch with Jessica, Bryce, and Zach.“Leave them alone babe, that’s how we are” Justin laughs.“Oh, you get me flowers?” when Justin doesn’t answer, all of us start cracking up. “Well I’m going to get a beer, you guys want one?” Zach asks as he gets up. “Nah no thanks man, my girl will kill me cause I’m the driver tonight” I smile when he said that, happy that he cares about his well being. We continue talking to our group of friends and have a pretty good time.“Where is Clay and Hannah” I whisper in his ear.“Somewhere around here, probably upstairs, I did my meddling for the night and got them together.”“Aw how noble of you” I giggle, pinching his cheeks. “Thank you ma’am”.“See! look at them, they are perfect” Jessica playfully whines.“Shut up!” Justin say as he grabs her face and start full on making out. Everyone starts ewing and shooing them off the couch.“Get a room!”“Jess, your room is upstairs!”“Get it Foley!”Justin flips us all off, never breaking their kiss and we all laugh. Monty taps Jeff on the shoulder and screams over the loud music.“Yo bro you still doing the beer run!?”Jeff got up and nodded his head, “Yeah shit I almost forgot”I got up with him, frowning and grab his arm before he could go anywhere, “Babe do you have to go? I’m pretty sure there is enough beer, just not enough for every single person to get ass faced drunk.”He kissed my forehead and smiled, “I’ll be right back babe I promise”. I pick up my bag and turn towards him, “Okay then I’m coming with you”.“Baby, you have to watch out for Clay and Hannah remember, I’ll be back in 15 minutes then we can leave right after.”I sigh still not liking this. I know he didn’t drink anything, but I’m still nervous for him to be out this late. What if someone else out there is drunk driving? I tell myself its fine and nod my head.“Okay fine, just be careful J.”“I will baby, I love you.”“I love you too.” he gives me a peck on the lips and I hold onto his hand and let it slide out once he got to far to reach it. I watch him walk out the door and sit back down onto the couch, waiting for his return.*4 Weeks Later*Life is unfair. Life is so unfair. Why him? Why Jeff? Why my boyfriend. Such an amazing boyfriend. Is the best. Was the best. I stare down at his tombstone and couldn’t stop my tears from falling. So many tears. I found myself screaming at night. If I wasn’t screaming I was just silent. Completely silent. I mean was there for me to say? He’s gone. Jeff Atkins is gone. Never to hold me again, never to make me feel better, never to get me the flowers, never to throw rocks outside my window. I bend down and touch his stone. “I-I m-miss you so much” my voice cracks. “Why d-did you h-have to leave m-me?” I start crying harder. This is my first time being at his grave, due to the fear of seeing him. The fear of seeing reality of this situation. “Y-you would b-be so happy right now” I hiccup as I touch my stomach. I felt the little bump and smile through my tears.“Y-you would have told him knock knock jokes” I laugh to myself, “or her”.“Y-you would have t-taught baseball terms” I smile.“You would h-have been the perfect dad” I cried looking down at him, “the best”.I put the roses he always got me onto his grave and wiped my tears, even though they kept coming down. I kissed my finger and touched them against his stone that read Jeff AtkinsWorld’s greatest son world’s best companionEven a better dadGone but never forgotten.“I love you Jeff”I got up and continued crying as both Tony and Clay stood there respectfully and silent, waiting for me to finish. I smile lazily at them and hooked my arm into both of theirs as we walked out of the graveyard. I look back one more time and thought to myself ‘the love of my life might be gone, but he will forever live on in my heart’A/N - Omgg!! I cried making this ending. It was so sad to me. I hope you guys liked it and love you guys for all your support. Your imagines are not forgotten.

            13 Reasons Why Preference: PDA        Not my gifsOriginally posted by alyciadubnamcareyClay Jensen: Clay wasn’t big on PDA and honestly, neither were you. You two liked to save your affectionate moments for when you were in private, so your PDA would mostly be holding hands and a hug when one of you left the other. That is, until Clay got jealous– then all rules regarding PDA were out of the window, and he’d flat out make out with you in front of the person trying to flirt with you. Originally posted by zachdempseyAlex Standall:
You were much more into PDA than Alex. He’s a more private guy, but you loved to show your relationship off, so you’d usually be the one to initiate PDA. Alex didn’t mind when you did this, he’d always squeeze your hand when you grabbed his, or wrap his arms around you when you sat on his lap. He certainly would never deny you a kiss when you wanted one (which was always), but he the kisses were never too long or too intimate; he’d save those for the bedroom. Originally posted by 13-laraJeff Atkins:
Jeff would love PDA because he loved to show you off. You two would never be seen together without some kind of PDA. Jeff loved kissing you in front of other people, and his arm stayed around your waist at all times. Even when you tagged along to his tutoring sessions with Clay, he’d keep a hand on your knee or your feet touching under the table. Clay would always make fun of him for his constant need to touch you, but he couldn’t help it– he loved you, and he wanted the entire world to know that you were his. Originally posted by veronicsalodge Zach Dempsey:
Unexpectedly, Zach’s PDA would be limited only to when he was drunk. He didn’t want to be the stereotypical jock, who only thought about “getting some.” So for this reason, Zach was very careful about PDA. He wasn’t ashamed of you at all (the complete opposite, actually) so he’d steal an occasional kiss on the cheek or just holding you in the hallway for a minute between classes. But when he was drunk? A whole ‘nother story. He’d be all over you when he was drunk– kissing you constantly, pulling you into his lap, never ceasing to hold you in his arms. These moments were some of your favorites– when he let his walls down, poured love onto you, and let the entire school know how much he cared about you. Originally posted by despairingfeverJustin Foley: 
Justin would love PDA. You two would get in trouble at school all too often for “excessive public display of affection,” but honestly, neither of you cared. Justin hated being apart from you, so he’d always be sure to have an arm around your shoulders, his lips on yours, or at the very least, his hand resting on your knee. Sometimes he’d get a bit cheeky– a hand resting a little too high on your thigh, maybe– and that’s when you’d get in trouble. But he didn’t care, especially since the PDA helped ensure that no other guy in the school would even try to flirt with you, for fear of Justin finding out.

            Dating Zach Dempsey would include...        • Lots of basketball games, where’d you’d be on the side lines holding up a cheesy sign saying “# 7 on the field # 1 in my heart.”  • Him looking and winking just as he is about to make the game winning point!  • He’d run to you after a game through the crowd, just to get his winning kiss.

“Yes, but I’m your idiot, so it’s okay.” He says right before he kisses you.

“What’re you doing?” You said with a giggle, “You’re so weird.” 
He rolled his eyes, “is it bad that I love my girlfriend so much I can’t help but stare at her beauty?” 
You held out your spoon. “Oh shush and let me eat my ice cream in peace.” He leaned over and ate it as you gasped! “Zachary! How dare you?!”

“Zach, I love you. No one else” 
“But Jeff..” 
“He’s a friend, one of my very good friends and you need to stop being jealous about small things. You know i’d never leave you.” 
“I-I’m sorry.” 
You kissed his forehead. “I love you okay? Don’t forget that.” 
•you play video games with him, and sometimes he lets you win, just to see you smile and jump around. 
“OH MY GOD. I BEAT YOU.”

•He comes to you whenever he is sad, or upset about life. And the two of you cuddle and eat lots and lots of ice cream.

“I’m just saying it’s a shame, they’re so good.” 
“God, you’re so mean.” 
•He loves PDA when he’s drunk, but when he’s sober, he’d rather it be more personal, just between the two of you.

2Stay  ~Jeff Atkins x Reader~There’s something beautiful about the summer- they way it creates a new version of reality where music sounds better and happiness feels sweeter. Parties can give the same kind of feeling where nothing feels real, but all of it feels great. Well, until the next morning.This makes an end of the summer party the pinnacle of a new reality. Inhibitions run low and everything else is on overdrive. In a week they will all be students again, studying to ensure the best future possible. But for tonight they are 60% alcohol and 40% bad decisions. “Y/N!” Jess squeals with excitement, running towards the girl who just entered the room. She had been away visiting family abroad for the majority of the summer, and while the beaches had given a whole new meaning to the word ‘paradise’, this was where she was truly happiest. “Jess!” she returns the enthusiasm, hugging her best friend tightly. The warm breezes that blew in through her window every morning this past summer brought her comfort, but this was home.“I want in,” Justin grins, approaching the two and enveloping them between his arms. “God I’ve missed you guys,” she sighs contentedly.“You have so much third wheeling to catch up on,” Jess teases light heartedly. Her face twists up unpleasantly at the thought. She loves both Jess and Justin dearly, but she does not love the thought of third wheeling. “With all due respect, I think I’ll pass.”“Is that Y/N Y/L/N?!” a fourth voice enters the picture, causing the trio to part and turn towards the person walking towards them. Jeff Atkins. Baseball star and literal ray of sunshine with the face of an angel and the body of a Greek God. “Hey, Jeff,” she laughs, walking away from Jess and Justin to meet him halfway.“I haven’t seen you in forever,” Jeff grins warmly, brushing her arm with his hand. It’s a sweet gesture. He’s always been so sweet. “It’s only been like two months,” she mirrors his grin. It’s impossible not to smile back at someone who radiates warmth the way he does.“Feels like forever though. Especially since I was used to seeing you everyday at school. You look nice by the way,” he bumps her shoulder.“I missed you, too,” she chuckles, “I look like I always do.”“Exactly.”She bites her lips together before looking down shyly and letting them fall apart into a smile. Jeff Atkins was so genuinely good in a way that was uniquely him. “Jeff!” Troy yells from the outside patio, “Beer pong, now, c’mon man!”“Coming!” Jeff yells back to Troy, but turns back to her before walking away. “Come watch us play? You can practice cheering me on for baseball season,” his mouth twists into a smirk.“Who says I’m gonna come to your baseball games?” She challenges playfully, using quick wit to redeem herself from the shy smile.“Don’t break my heart, Y/N,” he pouts childishly, walking backward to join the boys for a game of beer pong but not breaking eye contact with her. He finally turns away from her to exit the house and join those outside, but not before mouthing a “pleaasssseeee” and sticking out his bottom lip.“I’ll be there in a second!” she yells so he can hear her over the music. His pout transforms into a grin before he disappears through the threshold, indicating that he heard her.“So how about a double date instead of third wheeling?” Justin and Jess approach her with Justin wiggling his eyebrows suggestively.“Oh shut up,” her face heats up at the thought, “He’s a nice guy. He’s friendly with everyone.”“Yeah, but he doesn’t flirt with everyone,” Jess interjects, crossing her arms over her chest vindictively. “He didn’t ask me to cheer for him,” Justin fakes offense, “Honestly I’m a little hurt.”“Fuck off, Justin,” she laughs loudly, putting her hands over her face.“You better get out there,” Justin presses, gesturing to the sliding door, “After all, it’s mine and Jess’s two month anniversary so an intense make-out session could happen at anytime.”“Bye!” she turns on her heels quickly, running away from her friends before they could make things awkward, or more awkward. ***Five cups of jungle juice and two games of beer pong later she’s sitting on a folding lawn chair watching Jeff singlehandedly win a third game of beer pong since Troy had wandered off and was bothering Hannah and Clay.After sinking another shot, Jeff notices where Troy had gone. A brief look of panic flashes across his face before he mutters a quick, “be right back!”, making a beeline for Troy. Jeff was just about as invested in Clay and Hannah as Clay was in Hannah. She wondered just how much better off the world would be if everyone had the same heart as Jeff. “Did you save the day?” she asks upon Jeff’s return. She’s quite drunk and seeing two of everything, including two Jeffs. How wonderful would that be? A world with two Jeff Atkins. Incredible.“I don’t know about that,” he chuckles modestly, “It’s up to Clay.”“Meanwhile that beer run is up to you, buddy” Troy points out, his words slurring together.“Later man,” Jeff replies, picking up a ping pong ball. “Because you definitely need more alcohol,” she rolls her eyes at Troy, a sick feeling blossoming in her stomach. “Don’t be a buzzkill, Y/N,” Troy retorts.“Hey, relax,” Jeff snaps at Troy, “you’ll get your beer.”The sick feeling in her stomach intensifies tenfold. She doesn’t want him to go, but she can’t beg him to stay. He’s not drunk, he would never jeopardize his life or anyone else’s so recklessly. But something about it still doesn’t feel right. He shouldn’t go. She stands up, wobbling slightly. She grabs the back of her lawn chair to steady herself before heading back for the house. The twisting in her stomach is ominous in a way that refuses to be ignored.“Where’re you going?” Jeff asks, his eyebrows knitting together.“I need another drink,” she mumbles, brushing past him. ***Three shots and a game of suck and blow later she’s feeling light and airy. All the anxiety from earlier has been replaced with a tingling feeling that reaches her feet. She’s quite hammered, and all the slip ups in suck and blow have her laughing and her sides aching. She’s starting to get lightheaded. “I’m gonna go get some air,” she gasps in-between fits of laughter.“Can you even walk?” Jess giggles.“I’ll crawl if I have to,” she shrugs, stumbling her way out the door.***There’s nothing like the refreshing sensation of cool air hitting your skin after being cooped up in a house full of drunks, especially when you’re drunk yourself. The feeling of a breeze on her face is intoxicating in its own right, so she continues to walk around the outside of the house until she reaches the front.There’s someone else at the front of the house, too. She can only see their back as they walk towards the row of cars, but she knows who it is. Suddenly she remembers why she felt the need to down three shots of vodka.“Atkins,” she calls out, stumbling a bit as she walks forward. He turns around at the sound of his name, smiling when he sees who it is. “Hey, you. Looks like you got that drink you wanted,” he laughs lightheartedly at her shaky balance. “You making that beer run?” she asks, wringing her hands together nervously.“Yeah. I’m not even a little buzzed, don’t worry,” he says soothingly. “Stay,” she says softly.“Huh?” he tilts his head to the side. She continues to walk forward until she’s standing right in front of him, her weight falling to the side enough to make her falter. He reaches out to steady her, keeping a firm grasp on her side. She places her hands on his chest to steady herself before locking her eyes on his.“Stay,” she repeats.“Y/N, it’s okay I’m completely fine I promise. I only had two beers like two hours ago,” he assures, his voice gentle.“I know, but it’s not like anybody needs anymore alcohol. I’m one of the more sober ones right now and that says a lot. Honestly I don’t even know how I made it out here on my own,” she sighs, “Just stay, please. ”He looks at her softly, his eyes studying the worry etched onto her face. She feels so delicate in his grasp, like a porcelain doll that could shatter with too much pressure. He has always been enamored with her.“Okay,” he moves his hands to hold her face, “I’ll stay.”She lets out a heavy breath, letting her forehead rest against his chest and wrapping her arms around him. Maybe she was worrying over nothing, maybe she wasn’t, but she’s unexplainably relieved at those words. “You gotta promise to watch me play baseball though,” he teases.“I’ll be there every game with a sign that has your name on it,” she laughs, tilting her chin up to look at him. “You gotta stop looking at me like that,” he shakes his head,“I might just fall in love with you.”“Don’t get my hopes up.”“Don’t leave for two months at a time,” he counters, grinning boyishly.“I’d stay right here forever if I could,” she tightens her arms around him.“I’d kiss you if you weren’t like 10 drinks deep right now,” he laughs, rubbing her back gingerly.“Let’s go inside. I need to get sober. Right now. Immediately,” she pulls away, grabbing his hand to tow him behind her. Their laughter echoes down the empty street as they run around to the back of the house. There’s something beautiful about the end of summer- the way things begin to feel more permanent. A simple request can change so much. All he had to do was stay. And he did.
