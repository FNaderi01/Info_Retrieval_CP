    Summary
      Christmastime was always special for Bruce and Selina. They first met around Christmas, discovered one another’s true identities, and made the bold choice to start their lives together around Christmas. Selina almost walked away. She was the one saying hours earlier “does this mean we have to start fighting?” The look on her face from then on broke Bruce’s heart. He wanted to make things work. He knew they could both be better for it.This is the first of a series of one sets based off the premise that Selina chose to go with Bruce and try to make a life with him. These will not be in chronological order but will all be interrelated.

    Summary
      Part two of a collection of mine called “The Batcat Fluff We Deserve” this is set post the 1991 film Batman Returns where the next two terrible movies after that don’t exist and the basic premise being that Selina decided to go with Bruce in the sewers that night. This is how their lives turned out. Enjoy! This is the day after the night in the sewers as Selina tries to adjust to the life she’s chosen and contemplates whether it’s really for her.

    Summary
      Part three of a collection of mine called “The Batcat Fluff We Deserve” this is set post the 1992 film Batman Returns where the next two terrible movies after that don’t exist and the basic premise being that Selina decided to go with Bruce in the sewers that night. This is how their lives turned out. Enjoy! This specific fic came to me last night while I was watching the first Batman and Bruce was not surprisingly absent from an event because he was off being Batman, so I thought what if Selina was relying on him to be at a function but he had to don a cape and be late causing her to take the reigns on the event?

This is how their lives turned out. Enjoy! This one is actually teeth-rotting fluff. I’m not making it up. Also it’s set hmmm maybe five months after the movie? Let’s go with that so it’s like May of the next year. Just a short little fic to help continue to fill in some of the foundation of their relationship!
