Selection criteria[edit]
DANIPS officers are recruited directly through the rigorous Civil Services Examination conducted by Union Public Service Commission every year.[3] Moreover, the cadre is augmented by promotion of non-gazetted officers to the DANIPS.
The Civil Services Examination has a three-stage competitive selection process. At stage one, there is an objective type examination called the preliminary exam. This is a qualifying examination. It consists of a General Studies paper and an aptitude test. Only the candidates who pass this can appear for the "Main Examination" which consists of seven + two papers (Two papers - English and regional language paper are only qualifying while seven papers carry marks). Each candidate has to select an optional subject (two papers) and to take four General Studies papers, an Essay, an English language paper and a regional language paper. This is followed by an interview.
Two-thirds of the strength is filled directly by DANIPS officers and the remaining are promoted from the non-gazetted police officers of the Union Territories.
Cadre strength[edit]
DANIPS officers form the backbone of the largest metropolitan police force in India, the Delhi Police. The cadre has a sanctioned strength of 434.[4] Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, is the cadre controlling authority for DANIPS. They are regulated by the Delhi Government on the recommendation of the respective Governor/Administrator/ Lieutenant Governor of that Union Territory.[5]
