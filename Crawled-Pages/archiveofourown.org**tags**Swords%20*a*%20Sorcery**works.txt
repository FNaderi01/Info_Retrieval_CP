    Summary
      A woman awakens in a strange and unfamiliar body to find herself in the dangerous realm of Eorzea, with no knowledge of her identity or how she got there. When she meets an oddly-familiar, heroic traveler teaching an obscure, mystical sword art, she joins him in a series of escapades and humorous misadventures to learn his unusual style of magic, help him solve a mystery from his past, and regain her memories.-Who will likely enjoy this story the most:Anyone who grooved to "The Guardians of the Galaxy Awesome Mix vol. 1", got most of the references in "Ready Player One", and was disappointed by "Pride and Prejudice and Zombies".Who will get the most authentic experience from it:Anyone who hasn't played FFXIV before and/or has a hazy memory when it comes to movies and other popular culture from the past 8 decades. If this is you, just go with it. Hope you're comfortable with recurring déjà vu.

    Summary
      When 8-year-old Catarina Claes splits her head open on a rock and regains her memories of her past life, she realizes that if someone doesn't fall in love with Maria Campbell 8 years from now, the world will end--and possibly by Catarina's own hands, at that.Armed with the knowledge of future events; a brand new, kinder, more eccentric personality; and hours upon hours of VN/Turn-Based RPG experience in Fortune Lover, she embarks on a years-long ploy to save herself and the world both from the wrath of the dreaded Doom Flag.

    Summary
      Sanguine: Optimistic, or, Blood-red.It was meant as a simple act of compassion, encouraging a bitter spirit to move on from the memories of a dark life and shameful death, and so be freed from the demi-plane that held him trapped. Exactly how he does that seems to be up for debate.Iswen, paladin of Kelemvor, accidentally brings Zaknafein Do’Urden back from the dead (about a century ahead of schedule for those following along at home). However he got here, wherever "here" is, he is determined to take the second chance she’s offered and carve out a better life for himself, even if that means living on the surface.(Updates monthly)

    Summary
      Know, o reader, that between the days when Mother Ocean swallowed the lofty towers of Atlantis in a deluge of salty spume, and the rise of mighty Ur birthed from between the fertile thighs of the Tigris and Euphrates, there was an age undreamed of. Hither came Cassilda of Aquilonia, a scholar, a lover, an adventurer, with burning curiosities and burning lusts, to break the mighty kings of the earth between her clasping thighs, fated to lie entwined in the arms of a goddess.

    Summary
      It's been ten years since the Iron Curtain fell from the heavens. Separated by miles of divine iron, the two kingdoms tolerate one another with passive apathy. Life is peaceful...for now. However, the flames of war are not so easily smothered. As an orphaned boy makes a fateful mistake one night, he's soon thrust into the newly kindled ashes of a strife over a decade in the making. Old names become spoken again, and a legend returns for wholly selfish reasons. Will the Iron Curtain hold, or will it rust and fade away like promises made in the past?

    Summary
      Life was considered peaceful in the world of Taomeria despite the dangerous monsters living in the shadows between the few bastions of civilization that exist between the seven tribes: Spirit Warriors, Phantom, Goliath, Phoenix, Aquarius, Hawk, and Valkyrie, but the discovery of some ruins in the region surrounding Cudnan Bluff resulted in tragedy as the Spirit Warriors were nearly eradicated had their blessings and protection removed and given a strict mandate if they were to be forgiven: Venture into the depths of the site: Nimua and destroy the relic hidden within.
