    Summary
      No -one believes Peter has an internship, excluding Mr Harrington. Everyone at SI loves the kiddo and all treat him as their boss, he has no boss and everyone (including Fury) answers to him. He is head of the Avengers, S.H.I.E.L.D  and anything SI related. Everyone there knows about him being the second spider superhero.
