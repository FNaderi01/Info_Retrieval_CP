    Summary
      They bow. Not like one of those pretentious bows like she would do at Yokai parties and not like the ones she would do with her brothers when they hosted tea parties. They bowed deeply, heads stopping at her stomach, one hand closing around their fists. This spoke of respect and honor. 
And that unnerved her a little bit. Why are they bowing so deeply?
“Thank you,” they said in unison. It’s unnerving to April and she felt the uneasiness coming from her brothers too. 
“Why are you thanking me?” She said finally, voice sounding foreign to her. 
“You saved my life?” Baby Leo said slowly, voice tinged with confusion. “That was an honorable thing to do?”
April blinked, “It shouldn’t be considered honorable for doing what any big sister would do,” she said. “That’s not honor, that’s just being a good older sibling.”
In which April, Sunita, Casey, and the turtles end up in the 2012 verse after a mishap with Leo's ōdachi and stay with the 2012 turtles until they can go home. They find out a lot of things that don't quite jive with them. Some things are the same, some things are different and they're not quite sure how to handle those differences.

    Summary
      It's been a 2 weeks since Splinter died and you'd think the brothers would be closer than ever. No one's sure what the others are thinking but it can't be anything good.Basically this is how I think each of them would cope with Splinter's death bc I feel like torturing myself LOL anyway yeah nd ill turn it into a little thing in the last chapter when they're all interacting again .3.

    Summary
      "Mikey here was just about to tell me what we could do to cheer Raph up while he's sick," Donnie says. "Mikey continue?"Now that Mikey had both of his older brothers attention, he grins. "I was thinking we make strawberry cookies!" He does his jazz hands as he says this and is met with looks of something that he can only put as disapproval. "What?""You do know that everytime that we have tried to make it-" Donnie starts. "We mess it up and Raph has to come in and save our butts from burning the cookies?" Leo finishes, "What would be different this time?"Mikey huffs, "We are doing this so we can cheer him up and to prove that we can do something on our own!" he says, "That's what got Raph sick in the first place!"Or rather, Raph gets sick after helping his brothers recover from the poisoned pizza puffs. Mikey, Donnie, and Leo take a shot at baking cookies for Raph while trying not to burn their kitchen down.

    Summary
      Halloween in New York, something everyone looked absolutely forward to."He will say" Raph began "I have no idea what is going on because they snuck out while I was asleep."And the turtles were absolutely no exception, after years of being underground these kids are ready to see the world."COOL DO WE NEED DISGUISES" Mikey yelled so loud Donatello had to cover his mouth almost immediately telling him to shush."Nope" Raphael said confidently "It's halloween all we need is ourselves, if anybody asks we just tell them that we're in our alien turtle costumes."That was actually a very good idea, even Leo agreed, "Okay fine, we just need a way to get out of here, and I know just the man hole" Leo said with his usual impish grin.

Neither are you and everyone else. I’m still alone with Draxum and his minions. No one’s coming to save me because I was stupid enough to get captured and no one wants such a worthless turtle like me.”In which Raph was kidnapped and tortured by Baron Draxum and his family has to deal with the aftermath of it.

    Summary
      After Mikey realizes Donnie's been acting pretty weird lately, he and his brothers set out to find out what's wrong. However, they had no idea what they were stepping into when they pulled the curtain to his room back, nor the emotional turmoil they would be stepping into. aka, Donnie thinks he's useless now that they all have no need for his inventions, despite what April's told him. Now, his brothers realize the fear that he's held since he's very first taken note of the mystic weapons and get to see just how terrifying everything has been from his mental standpoint.

    Summary
      "We're going to be okay.” His voice rang out over the rush of rain water through the drainage systems.   "How can you be so sure?" The future terrified you more than your enemies, for it was filled with countless possibilities, hope, and painful deaths.     He gently took your hand in his, a frown on his lips as he sighed deeply. He almost glared at your hand, tracing every line, vein, scar and mark, that was so prevalent in the fluorescent lights of the sewer tunnels. "The day I cry green tears, is the day we won't be okay," he finished with an ominous tone.     Your gaze snapped over to him, a frown on your lips- before you saw that stupid grin that was so blinding in the flickering light. You rolled your eyes as you pulled your hand from his, nudging against him. "Shut up.” You stated, a similar grin stretching across your face.     "You?" Chortled the mutant, nudging his face against yours as she laughed and shoved him away.     "I said shut up!" You blushed, rolling your eyes.     He only kept on grinning, pecking your temple as you both fell into peaceful silence, not fearing what was to come. You both would face it together, future defined or not.

    Summary
      The turtle trio has always been just that; a trio. It all changes when an exotic animal trafficking is intercepted and they find another mutant turtle, the worst feral mutant case the three have ever encountered in their two years of slowly disintegrating the exotic animal blackmarket. Raphael is a bit of a fixer upper-- incapable of communication, aggressive and terrified of a life larger than a four by four cage. Adjusting him to domestic life is going to be a mission all on its own. The fact that a gun toting maniac who desperately wants Raphael back is on their tails is a completely different hurdle.

    Summary
      You smashed the light blue pills between your hands, smearing the powder across your splotchy red face and neck. The storm howled outside of the abandoned crumbling apartment, screaming and banging against the vibrating concrete walls. A determination glowed in your vacant eyes, though you felt nothing. Who were you to end an oppression that had been going on for far, far too long? Who were you to stand up to a man who had destroyed the lives of thousands?"I won't let you go out there alone." Raphael glowered at you, chewing on the nub of an aglow cigarette, ash tumbling from the tip. He clutched a handful of pills in the palm of his hand, glancing at the boarded up windows with the red stained plastic holding back the toxic gas of the storm.He opened his mouth to protest or swear; as you swung the butt of your gun across his face. He dropped to the ground, little blue pills tumbling across the sand covered floor. You carefully picked each up one by one, popping them all into your mouth. With that, you stepped over his body into the brewing poisonous sand storm, willing yourself to not look back.
