                 Mini Bio
                I am a 39 year old LCSW and IBCLC from the Garden State. I am married to David. We welcomed our first child, Elliot Joseph, on July 27, 2005, and our second, Isaac Robert, on August 20, 2008. Isaac was born at home. I am bisexual and polyamorous. Harry Potter will always be my first and best fandom, and Harry/Draco my OTP, but I also read Dr.Who, Glee, Avengers, Sherlock, and House slash. be sorted @ nimbo.net
