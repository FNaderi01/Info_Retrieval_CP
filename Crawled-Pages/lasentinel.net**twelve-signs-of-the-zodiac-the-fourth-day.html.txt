“Twelve Signs of the Zodiac”  “The Fourth Day”            
				By Dr. Jeanette Parker                
	                	                Published September 5, 2019
		Dr. Jeanette Parker 
“Yeah, man, I follow my horoscope every day.” “That’s right girlfriend. I buy it at the grocery store.” Is it okay to live by horoscope predictions? Here’s the thing. Walking down the street is not wrong; but, it’s what you do on the street. Some people live by following horoscopes. Some stop in and want palm reading and fortunes from the soothsayers and accept their interpretations (both not good).
Remember the “witch of Endor?” King Saul lost his kingship and his life when he went to the witch who purportedly could call up “familiar spirits;” requesting her to bring the prophet Samuel from the dead, even though he required his subjects to not visit witches.
The Bible has a “theme” throughout from beginning to end…no worshiping idols. God Almighty hates putting bad habits and lifestyles in His place. When the stars and the lights were created in the heavens (the fourth day), they were created for distinct and specific purposes: “divide the day from the night, give light upon the earth; they were set for SIGNS and for SEASONS and for DAYS and YEARS,” not for worship. Start thinking you’re more and greater than who you really are and that you’re a star; think on these things.
        ADVERTISEMENT        
Who numbered and named the stars. “There are twelve signs of the Zodiac, called “the stars” (Gen. 37.9) Eleven of these bowed down to Joseph (twelfth). Zodiac means the degrees or steps, which mark the stages of the sun’s path through the heavens, corresponding with the twelve months. God named the stars (Ps. 147.4). Most of the names of the stars have been lost over time. Over 100 are preserved through Arabic and Hebrew and are used by astronomers today. Very likely their meaning is unknown to the astronomers.
Job 9:9; 38,31; cites Arcturus, Orion and Pleiades. These names and the twelve“signs”go back to the foundation of the world. Josephus (renowned Hebrew historian) assures that Bible astronomy was invented by Adam, Seth, and Enoch. Astrology usage is corrupted, perverted with horoscopes and other cultic use. The primitive truth based on biblical facts (for those who believe the Bible) has been corrupted and discredited by non-believers. Our written scriptures began with Moses about 1490 B.C. For more than 2,500 years, the revelation of the hope (coming of Messiah) which God gave was preserved in the naming of the stars and their grouping in Signs and Constellations which were first designed and named; then, the pictures were drawn around them. Therefore, the truth was enshrined and written in the heavens. No human hand could touch it. When the written word and “The Word” came, there was no longer need for the more ancient writing in the heavens. The original teaching gradually faded away and the heathen, out of the smattering they had heard by tradition, evolved their cosmogonies (creating their own understanding of the universe) and mythologies (stories, not facts-nonfiction) Companion Bible “THE STARS ALSO”
