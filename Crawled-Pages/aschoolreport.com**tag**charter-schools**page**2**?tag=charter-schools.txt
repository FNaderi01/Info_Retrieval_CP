									Commentary: How California’s legislation targeting public charter schools shows that blue states can oppress black people too

									Analysis: Charter schools yield 53% greater return on investment than traditional public schools
										Charter schools are the object of intense national debate. They shouldn’t be. The data show that public charters are a good investment.

									Californians hold split views on charter schools, but most are in favor of them as options for low-income children, survey finds
										Californians are divided in their general views on charter schools, according to a new statewide survey.

									Commentary: Instead of calling for a charter pause, Los Angeles needs to leave labels behind and put students first
										Los Angeles faces many serious educational challenges that require immediate solutions, including a declining student population, inadequate funding and an expensive housing market that makes it difficult for families to stay in L.A. These are all real issues that require careful planning to solve. Unfortunately, we fear these problems will take a backseat to the...

										*Updated Jan. 30 Hours after about 3,500 charter school supporters rallied at Los Angeles Unified’s headquarters, the school board approved a resolution Tuesday calling for a moratorium on new charters.

									‘A call to action’: School board vote on supporting a charter moratorium leaves a lot unanswered but presents an opportunity for inclusive talk and real change, advocates say
										Today’s L.A.

									Commentary: A blanket ban on new charters makes little sense. We need more, not less, of what works
										There’s a simple and hard truth to public education in Los Angeles: education access in our city has never been equitable.
