Where the Sidewalk Ends is a 1974 children's poetry collection written and illustrated by Shel Silverstein. It was published by Harper and Row Publishers. The book's poems address many common childhood concerns and also present purely fanciful stories and imagination inspiring images. Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association list the book as one of its "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children."[1] Controversial because of profanity and subject matter, the book was banned in many libraries and schools.[2][3]
A 30th Anniversary Edition of the book appeared in 2004, and two audio editions (1983 and 2000) are also available.
