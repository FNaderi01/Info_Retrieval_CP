    Summary
      “Famine or Raymond as he was going by now knew that there was something different about his wife Allison.” Or it’s the second season of The Umbrella Academy but the the four horse  people of the apocalypse in it. Sorry that the summary is bad the actual story is better.

    Summary
      In on universe Sam and Dean Winchester grow up together, hunting monsters and other kinds of supernatural creatures with there father. But not in this one. In this universe Sam and Dean grow up separately. Sam is kidnapped by Azazel when he was a baby and is raised in hell. Dean still lives with John but without Sam. I’m sorry about the bad summary, I promise that story is better.

    Summary
      “At first Sirius did not know exactly what he was looking at. He knew that there’re was a person lying on the floor unconscious but still alive, who was soaking wet. It wasn’t until he got closer the the person that he released who it was. “Regulus?” Sirius says in disbelief.” The second wizarding war the looming over the Wizarding community, even though the Ministry refuses to acknowledge this. With this uncertainty over them the order of the Phoenix is left even more confused when Regulus Black shows up not looking a day over 18.Sorry about the bad summary, I suck at writing them, I promise that the actual story is a lot better.

    Summary
      “ So he was trying to see them using the force. So far he was not succeeding. He didn’t know if it was because he was not doing it right or if it was because they were dead. He hoped that it was the first one. Finn took a deep breath and gave it one more try, this was the last member of his former squadron that he had not tried yet.He concentrated really hard, then he saw her FN-2009. Her light brown hair was longer then it had been when they were in the first order together and it was covering her face slightly. But he could still tell it was her, he’d grown up with her of course he knew what her face looked like.“ Finn, Poe, Rose meet up with Nellie a former storm trooper from Finn’s squadron and they go on adventures. Sorry that the summary is bad, I suck at writing them. But the actual story is a lot better.

    Summary
      The party thinks that this summer they are going to be able to kick back, relax and hang out at the starcourt mall. But when El gets a vision from Kali telling her that Brenner is back and that he’s kidnapping the experiments. This revaluation along with the return of the upside down and the mind flayer leads the group on mission against time to stop Brenner and the Mind Flayer. Along with bringing secrets long since hidden to light. One thing is for sure one summer can change everything.This is basically what I think season 3 should have been like, and I figured that since we are sadly not getting season 4 for a while I might as well write it down and post it. I know that the summary isn’t the best but I promise it’s a lot better then the summary.

This year, Tina is determined to make it work.Takes place pre-canon (chapters 1-4) and post canon (chapters 5-7). All the post canon takes place after my fic Can't Get it Up if the Android's Breathing but it's not necessary to read this.

    Summary
      He turned his head and slowly opened his eyes, needing a few minutes to adjust. It had been a long time since he had last blinked away any dust from his eyelashes.A trickle of water splashed over his legs and it left his pants, remarkably, soaked. His clothes were actually getting damp from the liquid, and he could even perceive the gradual change from solid muscle to frigid, trembling limbs.  Oh no. This couldn't be happening.Merlin, he thought. He was actually alive.
