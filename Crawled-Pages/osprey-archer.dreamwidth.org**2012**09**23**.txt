Title: BlackmailFandom: Downton AbbeyPairings: Branson/Sybil, (oh God please forgive me) Branson/Thomas Rating: PGBeta: asakiyumeDisclaimer: If it were mine, it would probably be the Sybil 'n' Branson ('n' Gwen) show. Prompt: hc_bingo, blackmail. Summary: Thomas needs a ride into Ripon to take advantage of a business opportunity. And he knows just how to get Branson to drive him there...Thomas unfolded the paper, eyes on Branson – watching for a reaction – but Branson, puzzled, didn’t react till Thomas read, “My dearest Sybil – ”Then Branson flinched.Also on AO3, here.( Blackmail )
