The Education Exchange · Ep. 117 – Nov. 4, 2019 – School Choice and Blaine Amendments in Montana
			Richard Komer, a former Senior Litigation Attorney at the Institute for Justice, joins Paul E. Peterson to discuss Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, a case which could declare the Blaine Amendments in 38 state constitutions unconstitutional.
Komer is defending plaintiffs, including Kendra Espinoza, who received a tax credit scholarship to attend a religious school.
In the Fall 2019 issue of Education Next, Joshua Dunn analyzed the Espinoza case in “Answered Prayer? Montana case could prompt last judgment for Blaine Amendments.”
