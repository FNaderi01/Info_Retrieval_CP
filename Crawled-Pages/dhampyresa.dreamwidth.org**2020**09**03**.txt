I have become a parody of myselfSep. 3rd, 2020 01:22 am
... I just spend a not insignificant amount of time being mad at Cicero for being Wrong On The Internet and writing my fave OOCOk more seriously his characterisation of Scipio in Somnium Scipionis is BadBasically I refuse to believe Scipio would talk about the razing of Carthage like it's a good thing ("Within these two years you will destroy it as Consul; and that title, which so far you bear as an inheritance from me, shall be won for you by your own achievement." MY LEFT FOOT in this house we do not respect genocidaires) If Scipio had wanted to delenda himself a Carthago he could have! But he didn't! And even if he had he wouldn't have done it by comitting fucking genocideAlso I hate Cicero's overly long-winded writing style.I cannot believe this needs saying but: I like verbs, ok.( I also like memes )What could possibly make it worse? Why to have two characters with THE EXACT SAME NAME, of course! He chose to refer to Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus Africanus Minor and Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus Maior both as Scipio Africanus which is technically not inaccurate I GUESS but a maddeningly confusing way to go (and yes if you were wondering it is also confusing and The Worst in French)Why, Cicero? WHY?!
