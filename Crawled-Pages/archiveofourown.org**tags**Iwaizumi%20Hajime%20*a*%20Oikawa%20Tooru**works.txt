    Summary
      It wasn't the actual pain that he dreaded the most. No. It was the silence before. The slow creaking of the door as the man entered his cell. The black of the brand slowly turning to a bright orange. The fear that today was the day he would break and tell them where Daichi was hiding.

    Summary
      Emptiness. As if he was falling within himself. Berating himself. Hating himself. Did that even make sense ?Oikawa Tooru was a nobody. He would’ve been handsome, if he actually tried to comb his hair.He would’ve been popular, if he made an effort to join the volleyball team.He would’ve been admired, if he showed off his grades.But Oikawa Tooru was a nobody, and for some reason, he refused to believe that he could be more.(AU where Oikawa never joined the volleyball team, never met Iwaizumi and is just an urban legend serving balls with his cousin in the local gym.)

    Summary
      “Iwa-chan. Please. I’m sorry. How can I make this right?”  “You can't. Not this time. You made your decision. And I can’t sit around and hope for a change that won’t come. Sign the papers, Oikawa.” The line went dead before Oikawa had a chance to argue any further. Tears began to stream down Oikawa’s cheeks as he slowly lowered the phone from his face. He’d ruined everything. Iwaizumi was his life, but he had made it so that this childhood friend of his always felt second best. It was understandable why he saw things that way, too. Oikawa wasn’t exactly a ‘giving’ husband, and he knew that Iwaizumi was unhappy. But he chose to ignore that for years in favour of playing volleyball. That was wrong of him, and he saw that now, but it took divorce papers for him to see it, and that was unacceptable.

    Summary
      (USHIJIMA X OC)They say that after making one thousand paper cranes you can make a wish and it will come true...---- Akiyama Umeko was a third year student at Shiratorizawa with one goal, to make one thousand paper cranes. This was her last year and she wanted to complete her goal. Umeko didn't really have much interest in anything other than the creative arts so it was only natural she didn't know much about volleyball. She had no reason to go to the gym, no reason to talk to the members of the club and certainly no reason to meet the captain of the team. However, a series of totally unplanned cliche events changed that.Soon she found herself very involved with the team and especially it's captain.

    Summary
      “So, you think this is the trip they give up and finally admit they are holding out for each other?” Kuroo sank down into the sand, handing Kenma an ice pop and nodding towards the two men splashing in the water.Akaashi sighed, “Oikawa is so good at reading others, except for with him. As much as I want to win the bet, this J-drama has been going on for too long.”“Mmm, well I think it is just you, me, and Kageyma left,” Kenma said, putting down his Switch in order to eat his popsicle. Kuroo leaned in to put his head on Kenma’s, sighing.“You think they will be mad when they find out?” The three laughed, “But what about Shoyo and Tobio? They know about that bet” Kenma shrugged, tilting up into Kuroo. “Maybe we will be lucky and finally put all the bets to rest this summer” Kuroo spoke into Kenma’s hair. --Or, the story of Iawoi finally getting together... maybe.

      Oikawa Hayami thinks she's all set for her third year at Nekoma High School. Fleeing to Tokyo from Miyagi in order to escape her past, she succeeded for two years without batting an eyelash.
But when her basketball club gets shut down and she's forced to become the manager of the boys volleyball team, she realizes that not everything (and everyone) in her life is bad... and that she can slowly learn how to trust people again without hurting others all the while.
And its all thanks to Kuroo Tetsurou.

    Summary
      While Kenma talks to a very animated Shouyou, I look back at Kuroo. He's staring at me with that usual stalker grin, menacingly stroking behind his cat's ears. I shake my head, and step towards him."Kuroo-san," I say in greeting."Kageyama-kun," he replies. "Nice glasses."

Certainly, most of them not seeing each other after a decade, will they be able to remend their relationships before their wedding day?

    Summary
      "I'm glad the cat is okay... We should find its owner! It isn't a stray, it has a collar! And it's friendly," Shouyou says, before turning to me as if remembering something. "Should we find somewhere to patch you up first, though?"I open my mouth to reply."I see you've found my cat," says a familiar voice behind me.
