    Summary
      (OC x OIKAWA)“I’m resigning from the Volleyball Club.” Yana Iwaizumi used to love playing volleyball, but not anymore. She joined a team  as soon as she was old enough to play competitively. Unfortunately, for better or for worse they were always in the top three strongest schools.After a sudden school transfer to Aoba Johsai she vowed to never have anything to do with the Volleyball Club or it's incredibly popular captain and main setter, Oikawa. That's a little hard to do, especially when your cousin is the vice captain of the team and Oikawa's best friend.

Then one day Fon comes for help...AU from the Teeth and Claws series.Crossposted from FF.net

    Summary
      Skull didn't want to start again, but he's glad he did. A new start allowed him to embrace his Metamorphmagus abilities, his political power, and make true friends. Also featuring confused magical Arcobaleno, because when a timeline collapses, wrapping your magic around your friends leads to hilarious results.
