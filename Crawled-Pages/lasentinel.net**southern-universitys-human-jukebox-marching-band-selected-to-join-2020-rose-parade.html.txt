Southern University Marching Band ‘Human Jukebox’ Selected to Join 2020 Rose Parade            
	                	                Published April 25, 2019
The Southern University Marching Band better known as the “Human Jukebox,” is one of 20 marching bands selected to join the Pasadena Tournament of Roses 131st Rose Parade presented by Honda, themed “The Power of Hope.”

They proudly represent Louisiana and are among the world renowned HBCU bands.
Thousands of performers will enjoy the experience of a lifetime when they march down Colorado Blvd. on January 1, 2020, each with their own unique story.
