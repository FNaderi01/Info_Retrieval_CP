                                                    i think itâ€™s weird how weâ€™re all just dipping into each others realities and even things that are tangible/factual can be processed and perceived so differently depending on your inner world. but maybe thatâ€™s why art/love is so important to humanity, and so symptomatic of it. itâ€™s essentially two people screaming at each other over a busy high way: this is how it is for me. how is it for you?
                                                         haha.....jk........unless?? ðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ª
                                                         i don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing mayb it's just the way it is like.....
                                                         we r social creatures but we go through so much alone. the only one that understands that voice in our head is us hm.....
                                                         so much is shaped by what we cant control. just the fact that we want to know how others see this lifetime is a comfort

                                                    stagnancy is really the most discouraging thing about depression. itâ€™s like you let one aspect of your life slip and suddenly youâ€™re a million miles behind everyone else and you canâ€™t remember how to exist in a way that curates progress
                                                         being stunted by financial issues and childhood trauma is one thing but adding my inadequacies as an adult on top of that
                                                         makes me feel like everything is genuinely impossible
                                                         good thing nothing matters buf this moment? why can't i live it though. why are simple tasks so hard

                                                    canâ€™t believe im going to die one day. thereâ€™s going to come a time where everything has passed and all i can do is succumb. i wonder what my thoughts will be in that moment. i genuinely canâ€™t fathom it. itâ€™s a level of helplessness everyone experiences but no one can share. i have to dye my hair imminently
                                                         like im always thinking about this in some part of my head it's crazey that it's going to happen
                                                         it's more certain than anything even this room im in death is like .......so inevitable. it's not even about relinquishing control
                                                         it's just about knowing it's coming and living with it looming around us all. ya if i don't find a distraction i'll go mad luvs

                                                                        fairycosmos

                                                         and by that i mean. slightly traumatized ! lol
                                                         listen ik they love me on some level and they tried but they didn't haaaaaaave to have kids as dysfunctional alcoholics
                                                         could've saved us all a lot of heartache

                                                    hereâ€™s something that sux to learn but that i think is true. if u build who you are around your depression and you turn it into a staple of your personality (even subconsciously) then any form of help/advice is going to feel like an attack on your character instead of a viable coping mechanism for a mental condition
                                                         it's like.......yes depression takes over sometimes but it's not all that u are........i think ppl including me get enamoured w their own
                                                         sadness. a lot of ppl i know have been through phases where they romanticise it or hang onto it bc they want to seem interesting and it's..
                                                         just so counterproductive. it's hard to divorce your identity from the pain when you've lived w it for so long but whats the alternative
                                                         i still haven't accomplished it fully but i dont want 2 pigeonhole myself like that anymore

                                                    any song that is solely about money or that shits on broke peopleâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦yawn
                                                         boring. congrats on having no creativity and nothin to say. celebrities flexing is just sooo telling and exhausting
                                                         but yeah keep trying to convince the masses that money is unimportant/to be humble. u couldn't be more transparent. dumb cunts
                                                         there's a difference between supporting yourself n turning into a cartoon villain with ur fuckin pride and greed. it's well liked celebs too
