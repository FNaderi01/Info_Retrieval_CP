But when her adopted sister/only friend starts ditching her to hang out with her new boyfriend Vanya needs some new friends. Enter Five, the slightly odd boy that lives down the street, who seems more than welcome to her friendship. Add on that weird things keep happening to Vanya and the world just seems too damn loud.

    Summary
      “You stay home all day and occasionally go outside with one of us. Come on, Five. Even I can see you really need a hobby.” He paused, “Like, really, really need a hobby.”The apocalypse is over, everyone is happy (or as happy as they can be), and the siblings all agree that Five really needs a hobby.(spoiler alert, he finds one) Or alternatively, me trying to fit Five Whump, wholesome sibling bonding, and ranting about music all into one fic. The only plot (so far) is following Five through his journey of finding and settling with a hobby.

    Summary
      They all turned back to the portal, the couple now glitching between the portal until they finally fell, looking young and kinda familiar. The girl fell to the ground first with her legs open, the boy fell on top of her, his lower half nestled between her open legs. Both groaned in pain, and with a twin grunt from both of them, mumbled something about it not being the 'right moment for this'"... Am I seeing little number Five and Seven or have I done too many drugs this evening?"(Original work Started: June 27th 2020Original word completed: September 14 2020)UNDER EDITING

    Summary
      This is not a ship fic. This is anti-Allison/Luther.Since meeting Raymond, something had shifted deep inside her. A realisation that her and Luther had never truly been in love- on her part, it had been a desperate plea for any kind of affection. On his part, he’d been under her control all this time. She had expected her wish to fade away over time, especially during the years they’d spent apart, but had arrived at her father’s funeral to find Luther couldn’t move on. He still looked at her as if she was the entire world. Without even realising it, Allison had been holding him hostage for… how many years now? Looking at him now, (how different he looked to when she’d last seen him), she couldn’t help wondering what Luther would be like if she’d never made her wish.There was no doubt in her mind that he would be happier.

    Summary
      Even to the least observant of them, it was obvious that she had spent a lot of time on this drawing and been very careful when it came to colouring it in. Eight different figures featured in the drawing, dressed in classic Academy uniforms, and were sporting typical superhero stances. Helpfully, each figure had been marked by a number but without them, it was still obvious who was meant to be who. The scribbled Number Six brought tears to Klaus’s eyes. At the top of the picture, the words “Umbrella Academy saves the day!” had been printed. “Who’s the one on the end?” Five asked, leaning forward to get a better look.“It’s me!” Claire announced, pleased, “In the uniform. I’m Number Eight!”

    Summary
      Looking down at her, he wondered something he hadn’t been able to stop thinking about for 10 months. Would she have powers? He hoped not. It’s not like anyone had any experience with this kind of thing. Was it genetic like a disease? That seemed like an accurate way to describe powers after all, an affliction. Hopefully she’d have a power like the others, an optional one. One she’d have to choose to yield. Not something she would be constantly bombarded with, either dying from it or having to drown it out with dangerous chemicals like he and Klaus. The thought made him shudder.
