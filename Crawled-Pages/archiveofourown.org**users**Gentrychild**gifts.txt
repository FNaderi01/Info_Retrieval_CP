    Summary
      Immagina un mondo dove il tuo quirk determina la tua strada e il tuo valore.Un mondo che non ha posto per un ragazzo quirkless.Nonostante ciò, Izuku è determinato a diventare un eroe.Finché non si rende conto che nessuno glielo permetterà.Così crea accidentalmente un’utile organizzazione (criminale).E (non così) accidentalmente ruba One for All.Potrebbe contenere Izuku che diventa tecnicamente un villain ma sempre aiutando le persone, All Might che corre in giro come un pollo senza testa per trovare il suo quirk rubato, e All for One che si rifiuta di andarsene.

    Summary
      Based on @Gentrychild 's sentient AFO quirk AU which I find absolutely hilarious and overall just love.Izuku just wants to get through one day without Hoard and Ichhirou throwing a tantrum, but considering he lives with two sentient quirks in his head who are literally formed from apposing ideologies he shouldn't really be expecting much of anything.

    Summary
      After the quirk assessment test, Izuku Midoriya is expelled from UA. After this he takes the only logical course of action: Attend UA anyway! And hide from Eraserhead like his life depends on it (which it might).Meanwhile the rest of UA need to decide out what to do with this reverse-truancy.Hijinks ensue.

    Summary
      Set in Gentrychild's Fugitive AU.The heroes have lost, and now All For One rules over Japan. Most heroes have been captured and de-quirked, and those who haven't live on the run or seek to escape the country. This includes even fledgling heroes, such as the UA class of 1-A, who struggle to keep their freedom in these harsh times.Deku has been captured to keep the others out of his All For One's hands, and now Izuku awaits whatever grim fate his villainous father has planned for him.Not even he is strong enough to endure what comes next.

    Summary
      “The, the warper. At the USJ, the one who split us up. The one who, who almost killed you.” The kid’s voice was thick with tears, but not unexpected. Shirakumo hadn’t told anyone else, after all. “I recognized his voice.”
“What?” All Might sounded as shocked as could be expected. Shouta opened his eyes, could see enormous tension across those bony shoulders. Midoriya was sobbing, burying his face in the older hero's chest. 
“That was my dad!” The detective was clearly rattled, and by the stiffness of his spine, the sudden coughing fit that broke out, so was All Might. “Mom said he was a businessman! Not a villain!”
