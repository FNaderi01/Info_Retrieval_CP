Hello!Jan. 14th, 2019 10:52 pm
This Dreamwidth account was initially created, pre fandom starting to leave Tumblr, for making posts on i_read_what, a book reviewing community run by kalinara, and focused around reviewing books we read when we were younger, and seeing what we think of them now. My current contributions to that are so far turning out to be Copperfyre Wants Everyone To Know That Rats Are Being Vilified In Children's Books, which is, I suspect, something of a niche topic. Post fandom starting to leave Tumblr, well... probably that is what I will continue to use this account for. I do have a Tumblr at copperfire, but I've never said all that much there, either! My main achievement in interneting was managing to fall in with some friendly people via Legends of Tomorrow, and so far managing to keep in touch with them. (I admit that I am not very good at doing anything on the internet and in fandom other than lurking, I am somewhat shy and always leery about what the correct etiquette is, no matter the platform.)Other than that my Dreamwidthing so far has been limited to reading other people's posts about fandom, which has been very interesting, but maybe I will embrace this chance to talk into the void about... something. We shall see!
