    Summary
      Instead of getting Pikachu on his first day as a Pokémon trainer, Ash Ketchum finds himself Aura-bonded with a Riolu one innocuous night. This little detail sets off ripples of change that completely shake up his journey to greatness. While being a Pokémon Master has a nice ring to it, being an Aura Guardian throws open a completely different set of experiences that will shape this adolescent into a man of power feared by those who wish to bring harm to the world.This is Ash's story, of how he became the greatest Aura Guardian since Sir Aaron, his tribulations travelling the world, and finding people who he would share his heart with forever.

    Summary
      A thrown-aside comment on the ethics of Mega Evolution and Z-Moves by a well-known journalist, blossomed into whole nations throwing the blame at each other for misusing those special evolution/moves. Which thenceforth sparked the first international war in centuries.Kanto, Johto, and Kalos formed the UKJK. Sinnoh, Hoenn, and Unova formed the AHSU. Alola and Galar formed the UGAA.[10/2020] New title, new description, and fixed chapter 1 so it flows better.
