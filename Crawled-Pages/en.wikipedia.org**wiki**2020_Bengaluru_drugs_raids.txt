		On 10 August 2020, members of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) made simultaneous drug raids in Mumbai and Bengaluru relating to an alleged international MDMA drugs racket.[1] Based on evidence collected during the raids, the NCB made arrests of 3 other individuals on 21 August. According to police, one of the accused had a diary allegedly containing the names of 15 celebrities: including reality stars, musicians, Sandalwood actors and models, who the accused claimed were regular customers.[2] Other searches were made at properties allegedly belonging to major Sandalwood stars. In light of the busts, Kannada filmmaker Indrajit Lankesh, brother of Gauri Lankesh, alleged 15 members of the Sandalwood were involved in the drugs racket, and accordingly gave a statement to police.[3] So far six people have been arrested in connection with the case, including two Sandalwood actors: Ragini Dwivedi and Sanjjana, and Viren Khanna, a celebrity party organizer,[4][5] at whose house a police uniform was allegedly found.[6] Other children of politicians and other VIPs are also sought by the police in connection with the case,[7] including Aditya Alva, the son of former minister Jeevaraj Alva who allegedly rented out his property for parties at which drugs were consumed.[6] An FIR was registered against 12 people allegedly involved in the scandal, including Jayaprakash, a film producer, Dwivedi, Sanjjana, and Alva.[8][6] They are suspected of buying drugs from Loum Pepper Samba, an alleged drug peddler from Senegal.[9]
The story has gained significant media attention and has led to statements from superstars such as Yash and Sivarajkumar.[10] The story has also taken a political turn, as both the ruling BJP and opposition Congress and JD (S) claimed each party was involved with the scandal. The BJP in particular sought to distance itself from Dwivedi, who, according to the party, "voluntarily" campaigned in the 2019 Karnataka by-elections for the BJP.[11]
