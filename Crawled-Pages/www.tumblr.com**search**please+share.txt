hey pals! my boyfriend was in the ICU recently where he almost died because his pharmacy REFUSED to give him his insulin AGAIN because he was a few days late on insurance payments. They put his medicine on hold even after receiving the payments. He almost went in to a diabetic coma, stayed in the ICU for two days, which gave us a hefty medical bill. We are struggling to pay for not only our rent, pets and my heart medications but now his insulin and a ridiculous medical bill.I’m asking for help so we can afford our monthly rent &amp; help with his medical bill so we can actually buy his insulin this time and avoid another ICU visit.thank you for reading/reblogging/donating! everything helps! I also recommend doing your own bit of research on the big pharm and how disgustingly criminal they are.paypal.me/JellyPawsvenmo: @AshBearBeans

            Take Your Gatekeeping and Shove It.        So, this past weekend, I took my 11-year-old daughter to SuperCon to meet her favorite actor (and favorite Doctor), Peter Capaldi. She wore a little blue TARDIS-decorated dress and some Doctor Who pins, and she nearly cried with joy when Capaldi greeted her for the photo op. He was a consummate gentleman and such a sweet and enthusiastic person. An hour or so after the wonderful photo op experience, she and I were sitting at a table in the food court area.  A burly, older man plopped down nearby.  He looked at my little girl’s outfit, smiled, and said, “Do you even KNOW anything about Doctor Who?”WTF, dude?I was too stunned for a second to even respond, so he started right in with the ‘quizzing.’“Who are the Doctor’s biggest enemies, and what planet does he come from?” this stranger asked.Now I had moved past shocked and right into indignant/angry/protective mode.“I don’t want her to be quizzed on something she loves, because I don’t want her thinking she has to prove ANYthing in order to be a fan,“ I told him.Looking at my daughter, I said “You don’t owe strangers explanations or information, ok?“  She said OK and looked relieved.Still he pressed on, patronizing grin and all: “Oh, I just want to be sure parents are raising their kids right.” Then he turned to my daughter again and asked “Who was the first Doctor, then?”I cut him off right there. “No. I don’t want her quizzed. At all.” Dude blinked in disbelief, sighed, and left about a minute later.“Thanks,” my daughter said. “He was making me feel awkward.”I held her hand and looked into her eyes. “Some men think they can have power over you by making you prove yourself. You never have to do it. They’re just insecure and pitiful, so they want to make you feel like it, too.  It’s not only about fan stuff, and it’s not always just men, but be careful not to fall into that trap, ok?”That crap isn’t harmless fun. It sets up a pattern of approval-seeking, self-justification, self-doubt, and fear of exclusion that is very dangerous for children (particularly girls). Fuck that.TL;DR:  Do NOT come at me, my little girl, or anyone in my vicinity with your condescending, gatekeeping bullshit.  The next time, I won’t make the mistake of even TRYING to be polite.Originally posted by tum-binha

            Reminder not to mock British people struggling in the summer heat        Our houses are built to keep the heat in because we live in cold-and-windy-land 9 months of the year, we have average like 70-90% humidity in the summer (depending where in the UK you live), and people literally die from the heat/humidity combination, especially tiny babies and old peopleIf you still think us not dealing with the heat is funny, fuck you

            Back To School Tips Master Post!        I had a few people asking me to do a back to school tips/ how to do well in school post so here it is. I’m a sophomore in college and an honors student so I plan on sharing the things that have helped me succeed. Even though these tips are things I use now in college, most of them I also used in high school so it can be applied there as well. Organization                                                                                                           The most beneficial thing you can do is stay organized.Get a planner.- I bought mine this year at Walgreens for around $7 but it has a plastic cover so all paper ones are even cheaper. A planner is good for keeping track of when everything is due. When I get my syllabi for my classes I go through them and write down the due dates of homework, essays, tests, etc, on the day they are due. You can color code your classes or just write the class next to the assignment. This way you can look at a whole week and see everything you have due for all of your classes in one place. It’s also easier to add in things or make changes if your professor decides to due so.Use a white board- I know white boards can be expensive, so if you can’t afford one, expo markers will write on laminated paper which you can get for around $4 on Amazon. I use this to keep on my wall and write the next really important date for each class. So I have all my classes listed on the board and let’s say my next big date in Psych is a test. I’d write that date on the board, then after the test, I’d erase it and write the next important date. These dates should be in your planner as well but it’s nice to have them right in front of you at all times so you don’t turn to the next week in your planner and realize you have a test on Monday. Buy durable folders- If you’re going to be using your folders all year make sure they’ll last all year. You want to lose any of your assignments. I get plastic folders at Office Depot for $0.39 a piece. I chose a color for each class and write the class at the top in sharpie and I’m good to go!Notebooks too!- You’re going to be taking a lot of notes so make sure to keep a notebook for each class as well. Mine were $3 each at Office Depot but they have a plastic cover so if you need to save some money get the paper covers because you most likely wont reuse a notebook.Get a pack of loose leaf paper- Sometimes you have to turn things in and if you’re like me then you hate tearing it out of your notebook. But if you don’t have a problem with that then don’t worry about it!Use some sort of bag/backpack- This will help you not lose anything plus you can put water, snacks, etc in it as well!Study Tips                                                                                                               Tests are often the biggest portion of your grade so knowing the best ways to study will help you out the most. Figure out what type of learner you are- This can greatly improve your study skills. There are visual learners; these people learn best with charts, graphs, and anything that show a visual relationship between information. So if you’re this type of person, to help study you could make charts, graphs, tables, draws arrows between points of information, or watch videos. Anything to help you see it. There are also auditory learners; these people learn best when hearing the information. So the best way for these people to study is to recite information out loud, or if your course has an audio book to listen to it. You could also have a friend read information to you and you say it as well. Some people are reading/writing learners; they do best when reading the text and writing down important points/taking notes. This is the type of learner I am so to help me study, I write out my own flashcards, I copy power points into my notes, and as I read my chapters I write the important information.  Something else that is good for these kind of learners is to make little quizzes for yourself. There are also kinesthetic learners; they learn best with more hands on activities. This can be hard to do especially with some subjects. If you can physically do what you’re studying then do it. If not, make a game out of it. For example, ask yourself questions and if you get it right take a shot at a basketball hoop or a soccer goal (if you don’t have these things use a paper ball and your trashcan or anything you can substitute. Figuring out which learner you are will greatly improve how you study.Don’t wait until right before a test- Cramming your brain with all the information a few days before a test will not help you remember and only stress you out. This is called Massed Practice and is proven to be a waste of time and information is not retained well. Study a little everyday or every other day. This is called the Spacing Effect and is proven to improve retention and recall of information. So it is best to do short sessions of study over a long period of time rather than a long session all at once.Find a good place to study- If you like quiet places and your house/dorm is too loud go to a library or outside if it’ s a nice day.  If you like a lot of background noise play some music or go to a coffee shop.Overall Tips                                                                                                            These tips are still really important but I don’t have enough that fit together to make another header.Work on what’s due first- Some people think it’s always best to work on the important things first but that’s not always the case. If your essay is due in two weeks and you have an assignment due in a few days then finish the assignment first. You’ll still have plenty of time for your essay. I suggest doing all your work but if something happens to where you just can’t then yes do the more important thing because it’ll be a bigger part of your grade.Writing Centers- A lot of colleges/universities have writing centers.  If you’re not the best at writing or just need some help you can make an appointment at the writing center where someone highly qualified in writing will read your paper/essay and help you with grammar, punctuation, idea flow, overall organization etc. I highly suggest checking to see if your school has one of these.Check your email/Blackboard/whatever your professor uses- This is where they may add extra assignments/ cancel class and not mention it in class. It’s always important to check.Try to relax- I know it can be hard, especially for students with depression, anxiety, and other mental/physical illnesses but it’s important to always take a moment and calm down. Take breaks from your work and do something you enjoy for at least a few minutes everyday. If you need a nap, take a nap. just set an alarm to pick back up on your work later.Don’t worry about being perfect- This is still something I’m working on myself but getting better at. Last semester I got a B for the first time since my sophomore year of high school and it bothered me to no end. But, I told myself I did my best, and as a person with bad social anxiety I’m okay with my B in public speaking. So for anyone else who feels like they have to keep their 4.0 all 4 years, don’ t panic if you don’t. There’s nothing wrong with not being perfect, almost no one graduates college with a 4.0. Always do your best, but don’t put too much pressure on yourself. I cannot stress this enough.Take classes you enjoy- Hopefully you’re in a major that you enjoy so you wont hate your classes too much but it’s still important to try to take a fun class every once in awhile. If you like art, take an art class. Then, you’re still doing work but also doing something you like.Get a tutor- If you’re not doing as well in a class as you would like, don’t be afraid to get a tutor. Most universities offer tutors who are students that would love to help you and wont be judgmental at all. There’s nothing wrong with getting a little extra help and tutors are often people who have already passed the class with an A so they’ll be very good resources.Take care of yourself- Overall, make sure you’re eating well and drinking water throughout the day. Sometimes it’s impossible, but try to get enough sleep. If you go out to party watch out for yourself and others. Practice self care and if things get too stressful and you need help don’t be afraid to ask.I know this post is very long, but I wanted to share everything I could for anyone who wanted help. If I think of anything else I’ll definitely add it later. I hope everyone has a great semester and school year! Good luck to everyone!

2Hi guys. This is a real emergency for me. I know I’m always asking for help but I’m not sure what else I can do at this point. I need $250 to keep my utilities on. Both my electric and water are going to be shut off next week. Our electric is $700 and water is $70. But I think $200 should be enough to keep the electric on and $50 for the water. Normally I don’t need help with my utilities. I live with my brother who works part time as a senior care giver. But he’s missed work for 2 weeks because he has to do re training and cpr re certification. Hes not going to get a check in time enough to pay our cut off notices. I would greatly appreciate any help at all. My cash app is $SophiaChester cash.me/app/LWDLGPG My paypal is Sophiachester@hotmail.com

            Invincible- a “special” story.        (Trigger warning- use of the word r*tard, mention of the Paris terrorist attacks)I am 6 years old, sitting in my 1st-grade classroom.I am proud today.I am not proud many days. This is new. This is something big.I learnt to spell a word, all by myself.I turn around and tell my teacher,“ I learnt to spell team last night! T-E-A-M team!”She frowns at me.“Maggie, time is T-I-M-E. You spelt team”“I know, Mrs.D! T-E-A-M team!”She shakes her head.“Class, tell Maggie how to spell time”As I turn around, a boy kicks the back of my chair.He whispers to me,“Stupid”I am angry. I said team which is T-E-A-M not time no because that is T-I-M-E time and I said team and I know I did but they don’t.So I believe him.I am 8 years old, standing in the gym.My gym teacher puts me up at the green line, the other 3rd graders behind me on the blue. He guides my hands to hit the ball. I miss, my classmates laugh at me. He pats my head and leads me to the bench.I notice how he doesn’t help any of the other kids, how they stay on the blue, how they don’t miss and hit the volleyball perfectly.He asks me if I want to try again.I shake my head.I am upset. No one else goes up in front and no one else needs help and no one else misses the ball every time and no one else goes to special time in the resource room and no one else is ‘different’.Just me.A girl whispers in my ear.“Idiot”I walk away.I am 10 years old, in the middle of the hallway.I tell my 5th-grade teacher that I was diagnosed with ADHD and Dyspraxia over the weekend.He nods.At the end of the period, my work is not done ( i was having a panic attack in the bathroom. I think my father is going to die because he is in Paris and there were bad people with bombs in Paris last week and now he is going to get blown up or shot because this is what 2015 is now)My teacher tells the classroom“many of you did not hand in your work. you will all have detention”He sees me put my hand up.“it does not matter that you have ADHD, Margaret. Do your work”When I leave the classroom to go to my speech therapy, i hear the whispers and mocks of my peers for the millionth time.“Baby”“Gay”“W-w-what are you going to do, w-w-wetard? gonna go cry? ”I do.I am newly 12 years old, sitting beside a boy who won’t leave me alone.My middle schooler instincts are telling me to punch him.I don’t- I can’t make a fist with my stupid fucking fingers.“Your writing is so messy, even a baby can write better than you. Are you disabled? You look like you are”I am.I don’t say that.I’ve stopped talking- I have barely talked since that day in 1st grade, when I learnt I was ‘stupid’.I know my handwriting looks like two chickens did the cha cha slide across the paper.I know that I’ll never be able to fly a plane, Or fire a gun,Or say big words without stuttering. It seems the world whispers to me,“Dumbass”I am 14 years old. This time, however, I’m on my bed.Many things have changed.I can say team (And spell it too)I can hit a volleyball (Not well, but I can try)My dad is not dead (I just said goodnight to him)I can make a fist (I have been kickboxing for 2 years)I am talking again ( I have found out that I do have things to say)I have friends (I have many. In fact, I had two sleepovers last week)I have a girlfriend (Those kids were right about one thing.)I am sitting on my bed and I am typing what you are reading.I am not a stupid, idiotic, retarded dumbass.I never was.It didn’t take much for me to realize that- it took a kind person and a math equation and a character on Doctor Who and a computer.I am neurodivergent.I still go to the special class. I still attend therapy. I am not bullied anymore- it just went away.Or maybe it didn’t.I don’t notice.I don’t care.I am so very very smart and I know it.I whisper to myself,“Invincible“I am.

Guys, I really, really, can’t stress this enough. my posts haven’t been getting any attention and the people JUST turned off our water today so me and my mom are left without any! We’re both disabled and without food too, so this makes it harder for us to get by unless we pay off our WATER BILL. We need almost all the help we can get because for the past few days, we’ve been doing nothing but struggling! I don’t know how much we’d need, but PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE! help us out! I hate having to ask for help, but everything has been going nothing but awful for us! we haven’t ate in 4 days and I’m starving too. ANY donation counts at this point as long as it helps!Mom’s cash.app is/ $GiveMeMoney77004we don’t use paypal anymore and this is our only way! My dogs need to eat too as they’ve only had water before it was cut off…

Hello Tumblr people, My birthday is on Thursday, October 08. Everyone had been so kind to me this past weeks because of you I was able to fixed my brother’s tablet and I was able to buy a touchscreen phone for my part time job.

I’m a kid at heart and I really love making kids happy. Please help me be the happiest on my special day. Thank you all so much! ❤paypal.me/marieklaar
