    Summary
      He’d been trying unsuccessfully to track down Malia and Lydia before he had to meet Scott, and then the Jeep hadn’t wanted to start again, and he just hoped that the goddamn rain wasn’t a further metaphor for this fucked up day, because he was already past his limit.       Scott came out of the clinic and Stiles didn’t know how he always looked so pulled together and calm with everything that was going on. It was one of life’s real mysteries, way beyond werewolves and the murder doctors.        “Hey, he said to his best friend, “sorry I couldn’t get the jeep to start again. It’s barely holding on and I couldn’t get ahold of Malia or Lydia.” His voice trailed off as Scott stepped into the light, and there was a look in Scott’s face, something he’d never seen there before.                “Scott?” He said, though what exactly he was questioning he wasn’t sure, but the look left him unsettled and on edge.        Scott didn’t say anything, he just tilted his head up slightly and raised his hand, a gleam of something catching Stiles’s eye before he could see that it was a familiar wrench.

    Summary
      Joe is building her degree on the premise that werewolves, witches, ghosts - all those things that go bump in the night – aren’t real. She can cite numerous sources on how all folklore stems from a human need to explain the unexplainable. When she chooses the animal attacks happening in her own hometown as a case study, she gets sucked down the rabbit hole of what is actually going on in Beacon Hills. Her cousin thinks he’s a werewolf, this other guy claims to be her mate, and she is just trying to make her next deadline without dying in the process.

    Summary
      The Ragnulf’s are one of the oldest lines of werewolves known. A gift from ancient times was given to the line. Though not all of the line will experience it. There are some who will experience a Pull. This Pull leads them to their true mate, a soulmate. The problem is, just because the wolf finds their true mate does not mean that they are the same for that person.

    Summary
      Derek’s goal, since he was twelve years old, is to become emancipated like his older sister. However, mowing lawns and cleaning pools isn’t as effective as he had hoped, so he applies for a job at  Kitchen Fresh, the bakery run by the sheriff’s wife. In the span of one night, he is offered an interview, breaks his foot, and has his carefully constructed tower of lies and secrets torn down around him.
Now, while Derek is closer to his goal, he finds himself adrift in a sea of agony and confusion, where the whole town has turned against him, and old and new enemies are around every corner. Through it all, he has to learn how he can be both broken and beautiful.

    Summary
      “Is this really necessary?” he asked sullenly, wincing. Peter imagined it was one of the babies nudging him in the bladder. “It’s… I barely even know these people.”Peter kissed his neck soothingly. Sure, maybe Stiles didn’t think getting fucked by all the Alphas among their closest friends and family until his water broke was a good idea now, but he knew his little omega would be grateful once he was so drenched in pheromones that he barely noticed actually giving birth.Yeah, Water Breaking Parties were an old tradition, but that didn’t mean they weren’t useful.

    Summary
      I have a lot of ideas, but I can’t write. This is how I share my ideas with you. Maybe someone likes one of the ideas and writes a real story out of it. Uploading will come with varying frequency. As I attack an idea I write and put it on.In most of the ideas I’m going to write, Derek will have a 90% chance at the bottom. And there’s a 75% chance that cheating is an important part of the stories. Especially Derek cheats on Stiles.

    Summary
      Theo Raeken disappeared after his plan to steal the powers of the Beast of Gévaudan failed. Seven months later, Scott is preparing to face off against a new threat when he finds Theo shackled and caged in a hunter’s secret laboratory. He soon realizes that Theo’s memories are broken. He can’t remember who he is, but he recognizes Scott and knows that he’ll be safe with him. Despite the threat he knows Theo still poses, Scott can’t resist trying to help his once-friend. As Theo starts to grow attached to his place in Scott’s life, disturbing flashes haunt him. He begins to fear the inevitable truth of his past, and the darkness that may very well still lurk within him.

    Summary
      A segurança nacional está em crise. O FBI já não está mais dando conta de tantos casos. O sistema carcerário está em crise, a criminalidade apenas cresce no país, e apenas mais casos aparecem, enquanto que o número de casos resolvidos diminui. Desesperado, o governo decide dar início a uma antiga iniciativa criada por um agente, onde os melhores agentes da cede de Nova York iriam agir, juntamente com..."Agentes especiais", para tentar reduzir a criminalidade no país e por ordem no sistema carcerário. Derek fora um dos agentes designados para fazer parte da iniciativa, assim como seu parceiro Scott e seu tio Peter. O problema é que Derek teria que trabalhar com alguém que ele odeia desde a adolescência. Ele acaba descobrindo coisas a respeito do passado. Coisas que mudariam completamente sua vida.
