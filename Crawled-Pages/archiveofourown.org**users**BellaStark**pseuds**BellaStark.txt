    Summary
      Intimacy had been something they’d had to grow into when they’d married six moons ago. Although they’d never been close as children, it had been an adjustment going from believing they were half-siblings to learning they were cousins to becoming man and wife in a relatively short span of time.Sansa could still recall the stilted atmosphere surrounding them at their wedding feast. The lords and ladies had been unsure how bawdy jests might be received by their king and queen nor certain of the depth of the pair’s affection for one another. Most considered it a purely political match made after the war. But, there was affection between them and desire as well. Not many knew that though. They had not spoken of it to anyone, not even to each other. Perhaps that was the trouble...***Or How Jon and Sansa get married and start having really good sex but still need to learn how to talk to each other!***
