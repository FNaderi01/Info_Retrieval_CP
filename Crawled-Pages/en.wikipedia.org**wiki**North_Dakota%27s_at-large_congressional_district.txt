History[edit]
The district was first created when North Dakota achieved statehood on November 2, 1889, electing a single member. Following the 1900 Census the state was allocated two seats, both of whom were elected from an at large district. Following the 1910 Census a third seat was gained, with the legislature drawing three separate districts. The third district was eliminated after the 1930 Census. After the third seat was lost, North Dakota returned to electing two members at-large (statewide).
Following the 1960 Census two separate districts were created. In 1970, the second district was eliminated following the 1970 Census and a single at-large district was created. Since 1972, North Dakota has retained a single congressional district.
