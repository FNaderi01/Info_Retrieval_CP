With the 2020 Tokyo Summer Games around the corner, the United States National Olympic and Paralympic teams celebrated their achievements through the Team USA Awards presented by Dow. Olympic gold medalist wrestler and 2015 Male Olympic Athlete of the Year Jordan Burroughs was the host of the award show.
“We don’t get to do this often,” Burroughs said. “For me to be here on such a larger platform, incredible stage surrounded by a lot of my contemporaries, it’s a great time.”
While the night was full of awards, the event brought together Team USA for an evening of fun before many go on to compete this summer.

“Winning a gold medal was just a culmination of you career,” said women’s water polo goalkeeper Ashleigh Johnson. “It’s such a huge goal and when you accomplish it with your best friends, it’s really cool.”

Inglewood native swimmer Jamal Hill also attended; Tokyo 2020 will be his first Paralympics. Hill swims the 50m and 100m freestyle, coming in first in the 2018 U.S. Paralympics Swimming Para National Championships in both events.

The Team USA awards crowns the man, woman, and team of the year in both the Paralympics and the Olympics. Coach of the Year honors were given to paratriathlon coach Wesley Johnson for the Paralympic category and archery coach KiSik Lee in the Olympic category.
