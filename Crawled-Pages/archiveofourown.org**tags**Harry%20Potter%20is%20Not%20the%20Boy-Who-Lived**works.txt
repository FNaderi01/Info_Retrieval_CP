    Summary
      Death's touch was an accident. He had just wanted to see his master. He was bending over the crib, the baby wiggled and Death noted that his diaper was coming undone. Unthinkingly, he pressed one cold finger against the strip, pasting it back together, and Hadrian James Potter's entire destiny became undone.

    Summary
      It's really quite an unnecessary question, at this point. Still, a Demon, an Angel, and a Chosen One all find themselves wondering why a school is so adamant in trying to kill its students. They return, either way, to a year chock full of overlarge snakes, relative incompetence, and too many complications with paperwork. It's as normal as ever.

    Summary
      Harry has lived many different lives since becoming the Master of Death. Some were filled with mystery and excitement while others were plain and boring. In his new life, he was reborn as the sister to the BWL as Charlotte Lily Potter.                 
    But due to Dumbledore and his manipulations, James and Lily gave up Charlotte to Sirius and Remus to only raise Edward. Sirius was shocked and disgusted by his friends so he and Remus left Britain to live in France with Charlotte, having blood adopting her and renaming her Pandora Charlotte Black. 
    They go back to England for the Triwizard Tournament and that's where this story begins.

    Summary
      "The life of spies is to know, not be known."— George Herbert.
"You know what must be done, Harry," Dumbledore said, his eyes dull."I do," Harry said. He looked over to his family. Mark was only a fourth year and Rose a first year. Was he ready to leave them behind for a life of suffering?Then he saw his parents, standing before his grandfather's grave and rage filled him. The Dark Lord had to die, and if Harry could help in his defeat, he had to."Take me to Voldemort," he said to Snape. "I'm ready to be a spy."
