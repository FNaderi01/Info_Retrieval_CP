    Summary
      Heyo! October is finally here and I'm here to participate in the Kinktober writing challenge. These will all be Bakugou ships because I legit can't ship any other characters. I hope you guys enjoy this wonderfully smutty work. Also, a quick note, I might forget some tags, so I'll be gradually adding them as I progress into more ships and kinks into this work.(Discontinued, but you can still read this as a one-shot book with a few Katsuki ships)

    Summary
      Bakugou is deaf, has been since he was a kid. He doesn't remember much about how he had exactly lost his hearing, all Bakugou could remember was the sounds of screaming was sharply cut off by the sound of ringing until everything went silent. He didn't hate being deaf but what he did dislike was not being able to hear Kirishima say ‘I love you’ with a smile on his gorgeous face.

    Summary
      Even if he wanted to focus on the shitty-ass film and the droning banter of the others, it’s not like Katsuki could while Kirishima was right fucking there. The searing heat of Kirishima pressing up against his side was suffocating. He was surrounded by the familiar musk of sweat and faint wood smoke—it was all he could breathe and it short-circuited his body until all he could think, hear, see was Eijirou Kirishima. But it didn’t end there (God simply wouldn’t let Katsuki have a normal heartbeat today, the fucker), and he felt a rustle next to him where Kirishima was seated.And then another.And then there was a fucking head on his shoulder. Eijirou Kirishima’s head, to be specific.
