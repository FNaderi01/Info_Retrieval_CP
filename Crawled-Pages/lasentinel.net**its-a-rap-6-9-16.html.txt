It’s a Rap 6.9.16            
				By Shonassee Shaver, Contributing Writer shonassee@lasentinel.net

		R&amp;B singer-songwriter Vivian Green
Vivian Green is back with a new album and music video for single ‘GROWN FOLKS MUSIC (WORK)’
Vivian Green brought fans the Gold selling emotive album A Love Story, is back with her fifth studio album Vivid, produced by Kwamé Holland (Mary J Blige, Christina Aguilera, Keyshia Cole and Fantasia) the album showcases Green’s ability to deliver feel-good upbeat records as well as the ballads for which she has become known for. “Work” has a different sound from her debut single “Emotional Rollercoaster.” The songstress turns it up with the release of new music video directed by famed photographer Derek Blanks as a colorful border surrounds the screen, Ms. Green shows off her dance moves to the upbeat track. She also brings back the looks of the 70’s and 80’s by channeling Donna Summer and the skating rinks of the past in between dance breaks,” according to vibe.com. The stand-out first single “Get Right Back To My Baby” received over 1.4 million Youtube views while peaking at #4 on urban radio, featuring a sample from Maze ft. Frankie Beverly’s classic “Before I Let Go.” “This album is fresh and spirited, sassy and funny at times,” she states.  It’s different from my other albums because of the energy; but very much still me.” In the ever-changing music business Vivian Green has stayed afloat delivering classy, heartfelt, and often therapeutic music for her fans. Vivid will assuredly continue her legacy in music. “Some fans want me to deliver brokenhearted music, and perhaps I will in the future if I’m in that space. What I can and will always do is produce music that is from my heart,” reports eurweb.com.
Singer-songwriter and record producer Maxwell
Maxwell gets busy with the new SUMMERS Album, upcoming duet EP with Alicia Keys and more!
        ADVERTISEMENT        
R&amp;B crooner, Maxwell has been serenading and belting out neo soul-ful lyrics since the 90s, his first album, Maxwell’s Urban Hang Suite in 1996 introduced a mellow, groove-based sound with elements of funk, jazz, smooth soul and quiet storm. Hot singles, “Till the Cops Come Knockin,” “Ascension (Don’t Ever Wonder)” and “Sumthin’ Sumthin” were produced off the debut making him one of many neo-soul artists on the rise. His fourth studio album BLACKsummers’night in 2009 went platinum, produced four singles that garnered Billboard chart success and earned him two Grammy Awards. He follows up with the success of the album with a sequel, SUMMERS or blackSUMMERS’night with featured track “Lake by the Ocean” released this past April, a regular on radio air waves. The song is currently #1 on the Urban AC chart with the lyric video nearing a million views, according to eurweb.com. “The album’s pretty much about the last day of summer, so I felt like it was a good idea to release it at the end of the summer,” Maxwell told billboard.com. “It has that bittersweet feel to it. I don’t like things to be too happy. It’s when you go back to school, summer’s over then you kind of have that wonderful week where you get crazy. “For me one of the ways God has been so good is I work with the people who are the best on some level. I know a lot of people weren’t expecting SUMMERS  to be what it was, just like a lot of people weren’t expecting Embrya to be what it was. People will listen to what I’ve been a part of and see what I’ve done. Not wanting to stay in the same music zone, he states, “even though some people go, “oh yeah I wish you’d done another ‘Urban Hang Suite,’ I’d rather that than, “oh you did another ‘Urban Hang Suite.’ Maxwell is teaming up with Alicia Keys for a duet EP, the duo came together for song “Fire We Make” in 2012.  “I’ve been working with Keys, we toured together and she was an opening act for me, and she was a labelmate. Thank God she ended where she wound up going.” “We’re definitely working on an EP that’s sort of Marvin Gaye/Tammi Terrrell. We got a thing musically.”  Maxwell will be headlining with other mega artists for the 2016 Essence Music Festival. Performing singles new album, the singer is looking forward to the festival, “It is unbelievable to be a headliner and it’s a shock to me that it even still happens. I’m amazed by it because I don’t necessarily go out of my way to make records for people, for radio and all that.” Maxwell will be gearing up for a North American summer tour in support of blackSummers’ night, which begins on June 18 in Tacoma, Washington and winds down in Jacksonville, FL, on August 7. ‘SUMMERS’ will be available digitally and physically July 1.

Actress and singer-songwriter Alicia Keys
Alicia Keys releases new Summer Hit “IN COMMON”
Shying away from the forefront of the music scene with motherhood, playing the artist and love interest ‘Skye Summers’ opposite Jamal Lyon in the second season of Empire and becoming one of the latest judges on Season 11 of The Voice, Alicia Keys returns center stage with ‘hip’ new single, “In Common.” Releasing “28 Thousand Days” last July, she is back for the summer, dropping her newest track with an eclectic music video. “In Common” will be featured off her her upcoming untitled sixth studio album. Written by Keys, Illangelo(The Weeknd), Tayla Parks(Rihanna) and Billy Walsh, and produced by Illangelo, the song departs from her R&amp;B sound of romantic and inspiring up-tempo and ballads, but having a mixture of tropical dancehall rhythm, a Latin and Afrobeat instrumental, and a EDM sound. The song reflects a dysfunctional love story, and how the partners are similar, despite their faults.  Released last month, the video was shot in black and white and embodied simplicity with Key’s singing her lyrics with various dancers freestyling contortionist body movements. “This video is about celebrating our individuality, and how in the brilliance of our uniqueness, the magic of it all is at the core, we are all the same,” Keys says in a statement. “We want the same things. We all want to experience love, the freedom to be our truest selves, to love whomever we want and to be accepted and celebrated for all of our nuances and so called imperfections that make us, us.” She continues to take her stance on social awareness, launching a #NoMakeup Movement, posing make up free in Fault Magazine. She influences women to relinquish the pressure of having to look a certain way. She peened a letter to publication lennyletter.com, HBO’s GIRLS Jennifer Konner and Lena Dunham feminist online newsletter, stating to Huffingtonpost.com, “Not my face, not my mind, not my soul, not my thoughts, not my dreams, not my struggles, not my emotional growth. Nothing,” she said. “I swear it is the strongest, most empowered, most free and most honestly beautiful that I have ever felt,” she said of the experience. “In Common” is available for digital download.
