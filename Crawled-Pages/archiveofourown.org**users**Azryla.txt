    Summary
      So what if her savior turned out to be a chain smoking, functional alcoholic conman with worse demons that hers? He’d housed and protected her, encouraged and nurtured her, and yes, even loved her through her worst times. He’d shown her more kindness than anyone else she’d met since her life fell apart. They aren’t blood, but that doesn’t mean they are not family.
AU diverging from Legends season 3, in which John went back for Nora in the asylum, managed to free her from Mallus and unofficially adopted her. Nearly 4 years later, Nora's about to graduate high school and John's struggling with the fact that his foster daughter's all grown up.
