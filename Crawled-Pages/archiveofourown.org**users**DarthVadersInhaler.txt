    Summary
      The rise and fall of the Minyard-Josten Rivalry.   Usually when Neil starts shit in a post-game press interview, he does it on purpose. This time, he really just meant for it to be a joke.
  “How do you feel about the possibility of ending up on a team with a former Fox teammate?” is the next question.
  “Great,” Neil answers, sincere. “I would love to play with Matt or Kevin again.”
  “What about Minyard? Would you sign with Atlanta?”
  Neil says, “Andrew? He’s a nightmare.”
  He knows it’s a joke. His team knows it’s a joke. Andrew will know it’s a joke.
  The press does not seem to know that it’s a joke.

    Summary
      “Take his helmet off” Aaron instructs, when Andrew clearly isn’t responding. Neil hesitates. Part of him knows he has to, that its a necessary evil. The other part of him doesn’t want to do it without knowing that Andrew is cognizant enough to recognise Neil’s touch. He shucks off his gloves and unsnaps his wrist-guards first, careful to unclip Andrew’s helmet with a delicacy not often afforded on the court and slips it off slowly enough that he feels it right in his chest when Andrew’s head lolls back against the cold floor. “Someone get his jersey out of the way, the bastard got him in the stomach”“No” Neil snarls, not recognising his own voice.Aaron reaches forward and Neil smacks his arm away. “Josten, will you fucking-”“Neil”
