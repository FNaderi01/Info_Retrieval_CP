                "I can resist everything except temptation." - Oscar Wilde"I could have missed the pain, but I'd have had to miss the dance." - Garth Brooks"The only important thing in a book is the meaning that it has for you." - W. Somserset Maugham“Books are the plane, and the train, and the road. They are the destination, and the journey. They are home.” - Anna Quindlen“Books are the quietest and most constant of friends; they are the most accessible and wisest of counsellors, and the most patient of teachers.” - Charles William Elliot
