      The second Siren swam in, reeking of alcohol, Kappa immediately knew something was wrong.‚ÄúHeyyyyy Kappaaaaa‚Äù slurred Siren, followed by hiccup.‚ÄúWhy are you drunk?‚Äù questioned Kappa worriedly, as he watched Siren stumble closer to his cell.‚ÄúBecause I was drinkingggg dummy!‚Äù replied Siren, as he burst into giggles.Kappa sighed, knowing he wouldn‚Äôt get a straight answer out of Siren. Instead, he brought Siren closer to the cell door, as he wrapped an arm around Siren‚Äôs lean figure.Siren leaning into Kappa‚Äôs touch, whispered ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really cuteee.‚Äù

    Summary
      Avatar AU where everything is the same except the war never happened. Sozin was gonna use the comet to start the war but Roku visited him in a dream and was like 'you better not or I swear you'll regret it'. Plot; When one of Ozai's children runs away with knowledge that could wreck everything he has in store, Ozai hires some of the best benders in the world to go after him. The group includes the Avatar(who recently was freed from an iceberg he'd been stuck in for a 100 years and now lives with the rest of the monks up in the temples), The Blind Bandit(The best earthbender there is), The worlds best waterbending prodigy(Her brother insisted he come along as well, and he wasn't bad with a sword). Ozai sends his daughter to lead the team. However, when they find Zuko and learn of Ozai's secret plan, they all grudgingly band together to take him down and put one of the fire nation siblings on the throne.  (Sorry for the awful description, the story will be much better I swear)
