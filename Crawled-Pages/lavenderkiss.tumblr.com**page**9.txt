                        akamaruu:one of my favourite things in the world is casual intimacy. a small hand on your back when you’re in crowded streets. a gentle kick from where they’re sitting across the table. a head on the shoulder, a hand in your hand, a squeeze on the arm as they’re walking past you. and i think maybe love isn’t made up of grand gestures or explosive displays but that it’s made up of the little things. the little things that say i’m here and i care for you and that your life has intertwined so deeply into mine that that there’s no need to think, because casual intimacy comes easy

                        seashellronan:the reason we are so obsessed with romance and why we consume it at every opportunity is because we’re looking for proof!!!!! we’re desperate for it!!! we just want to know it’s real but we never believe it not fully!!! we see two people madly in love and we swoon but that little voice in our head is always there saying it won’t last!!! by we i mean me this is an autobiographical post
