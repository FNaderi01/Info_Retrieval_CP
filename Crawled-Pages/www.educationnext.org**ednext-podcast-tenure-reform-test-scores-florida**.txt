EdNext Podcast · Ep. 126 – May 30, 2018: Tenure Reform and Test Scores in Florida
			In 2011, a Florida law eliminated tenure for teachers hired on or after July 1, 2011. A new study looks at the impact of that change on student achievement in the state.
Celeste Carruthers, an associate professor in the Haslam College of Business at the University of Tennessee, joins EdNext Editor-in-chief Marty West to discuss the new study, “Did Tenure Reform in Florida Affect Student Test Scores?,” which she co-authored with David Figlio and Tim Sass.
The EdNext Podcast is available on Apple Podcasts, Google Play, Soundcloud, Stitcher and here every Wednesday.
