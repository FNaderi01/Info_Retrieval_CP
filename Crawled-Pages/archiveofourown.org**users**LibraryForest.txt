    Summary
      Helping your sister take care of her new twins is vexing. Figuring out a stable and robust system of government for Narnia that will outlast your death is even more vexing, but you can't properly manage the former task without eventually facing the latter. AU, no White Stag.

Dovahkiin?
A new facet is brought to the fore as forces beyond reality clash, and a wayward hero finds herself in a world far older than her own, and yet similar in some ways.
Setting forth to find her way back home, this unknown hero must face new foes and make new allies, lest she too fall prey to the machinations of those who crave her death... or worse.

    Summary
      “Belos gave me a choice. He told me to get rid of Luz, one way or another. And I did. Now everyone’s back in the realm they belong in, nobody got hurt and Luz is forever out of danger. It’s best for everyone involved that way.”“Keep telling yourself that, Lily.” Eda glared daggers at her sister. “Oh, and solid job on locking your own protégée out of the Boiling Isles, by the way.”“What are you talking about?”“Amity went through the door after Luz,” Emira chimed in. Her voice was scarily monotone. “Now she’s trapped on the other side of the portal you just destroyed.”—Summer has come to an end, which means Luz is forced to return from ‘summer camp’ and resume her regular life back at home with her mom. When she leaves, she promises she’ll be back soon.Unable to overcome her fear of telling Luz how she feels about her before she steps through the door, Amity finally finds the courage to do it when the door closes behind Luz and makes the rash decision to follow her.Then something goes wrong, and now Amity is stuck in Luz’s realm with her crush, far away from everything she’s ever known.Getting back home might prove more difficult than she’d originally hoped...

    Summary
  “So few?”
  “You mean us?” Claude asked, gesturing to the other members of his—their—house. “You’re looking at the cream of the crop, Teach.”
Being strong takes more than skill with a blade. It takes love, vulnerability, respect. It takes a family, it takes friends. It takes a herd.They were the few, the Deer. When the world looked down on Leicester, they stood firm. The band of misfits would show everyone their tenacity.It all may have started at Garreg Mach, but it would echo throughout Fódlan.A Canon Compliant Retelling~
