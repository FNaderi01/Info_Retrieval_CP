    Summary
      The vicomte has lost his wife and subsequently everything else. A recluse hiding within the rooms of his dead father’s house, he resigns himself to alcohol and does his best to blunt the residual pain. Months of numbness pass before he thinks that the opera ghost might like to hear the news of Christine’s death. He’s not the only one who thinks so: he receives a note from Madame Giry that, just like him, the opera ghost is wasting away, dying below the streets of Paris. Giry tasks the vicomte with retrieving the dying ghost to save his life, but the vicomte has other plans: to put the wretched creature out of its misery once and for all.It does get happy.

      Three months after he turned 22, Raoul made the brash decision to leave all he's known behind and went into business of running an Opera with incompetent fools.He's the proud Stage Papa of 36 talented people, best friend to a stage manager with crippling anxiety, casually courting a sociopathic murder addicted "ghost," and just doing his best to save the Opera Populaire from any sordid thing that comes their wayand if you don't like all that he do, you can suck a duck . . .Raoul: It's not always doom and gloom at the Opera. Sometimes it's weird, fun, and unusual. Sometimes.

    Summary
      “You’re insane,” Erik murmured as he took her hand and kissed her fingers.“Says the man who bought a whole theater,” Christine quipped.  “What I’m saying is, we all cope in our own way.  Why do you think I’m sewing masks?”Erik rolled onto his back with a soft grunt.  “You have unaccountable fixations.”
