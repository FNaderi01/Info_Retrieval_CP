        CENTRAL SUPPORT GROUP (CSG)
        Each of the three Central Support Group comprises armed-capable officers who are deployed regionally, often at short notice, to support Force operations when extra resources are needed. The CSGs are based at Aldershot, Bicester and Menwith Hill. They work inter-operably with the MDP Operational Support Unit, and other units such as dog teams. CSG Officers are highly trained. They carry out a wide range of important duties - including armed escorts, public order policing, searches with dog teams, and high-profile armed policing of nuclear defence assets.
