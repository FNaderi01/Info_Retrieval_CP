    Summary
      Kinktober 2020, #6: "Public Use"There was a time honored tradition of sharing an Omega. Where an Omega would share their Heat with all the Alphas in the Pack - it was said to cement the bonds as the Omega would trust the Alphas of the Pack to care for and protect them, to make them stop hurting and tend to them, and the Alphas would bond in that they had to share, to keep from fighting, to work together to tend something so precious to them. And though you worried - you were the only Omega in the Pack, after all - you trusted them. The girls would be there if anyone got out of hand, and so would some of the men who wouldn’t be participating. And, though many books liked to portray it as such, it wasn’t some thrashing, writhing orgy - no, though an Alpha or two might share the Omega at the same time, they would never put the Omega at risk in such a way, would be careful and give the Omega a break between turns. You’d be taken on and off over the days of your Heat with maybe even hours of rest between goes - it sounded almost pleasant, really, at least to a Heating Omega.

    Summary
      When Ginny Sinclair finds notes and sketches of some ancient rock carvings in an old journal written by her great-grandfather, she decides to spend her vacation searching for a couple of these carvings in some sort of Indiana Jones-type adventure. It starts out well enough, until she wakes up from an accident in the year 1899. She quickly realizes that her crazy great-grandfather may have been onto something with his scrawled ramblings about time-travel. With a little help from a kind stranger, she sets out to find him and, hopefully, find her way back home.
Eventual Arthur/Ginny. Canon-typical violence, language, and situations. Follows some of the storyline, and Arthur manages to avoid TB.

    Summary
      Arthur has spent so long preparing to die, now he must reconcile with finding a new life after two years recovering from his illness. Charlotte Balfour has learned to survive on her own. But after defending her home from drunk Murfree Brood intruders, Charlotte finds herself in need of help again from an old friend and finds herself thinking less and less of Cal.______________Slow burn romance. Arthur settles down but finds that his life as a retired outlaw is not as tame as he thought while he deals with old enemies, new roles and the struggle to be a good man. As the years pass, Arthur will run into old friends (giving us those scenes we all wanted to see in the game) and old enemies. An on-going work. New chapter every few weeks.

    Summary
      He hadn’t recognized Kieran when Dutch had first pointed him out. Hadn’t connected the gruesome sight with the quiet, anxious little slip of a man until Mary-Beth had screamed. Though, to be fair, he’d been up on the second story of the house, and there hadn’t been much of Kieran to recognize. Under the blood, his face looked like a dried up bowl of Pearson’s worst stew. The blue jacket and poncy little necktie he’d worn had been gone, and the white shirt beneath had been stained red with blood. And, of course, he hadn’t ridden back into camp on his beloved Branwen. Nothing about the… thing atop the strange horse was recognizable as Kieran.
