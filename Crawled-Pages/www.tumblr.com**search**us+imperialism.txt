makes me CRAZY how well atla illustrates all the different ways countries can be affected by colonization and imperialism…the air nomads wiped out in a relatively brief military campaign. the southern water tribe slowly worn down and violated over the course of decades. the northern water tribe completely isolating and turning to strict tradition in the face of a horrifying enemy. the decentralized earth kingdom being affected in varying ways, with some areas completely untouched but terrified that they’ll be next, some areas in an uneasy peace with the fire nation in exchange for economic domination, and some areas completely taken over. and just the ways that these kind of interplay…like the trauma katara and sokka have as people who live relatively safe from invasion, but with the threat of another raid always on the horizon, terrified that the next one will wipe them out for good, is completely different from the trauma aang has, as someone who lost everything and didnt witness the brutality, only its aftermath, and that’s completely different from the trauma that suki has, with kyoshi out of the war but constantly training in preparation for an invasion, and thats completely different from the trauma haru has, as an earthbender in an actively occupied village. and theres so much more too like theres all these complex and nuanced situations and none are objectively better or worse than the other but it shows exactly how many tools imperialism uses to demoralize and defeat those its directed against

anonymous asked:Don't turn this into a 'war for oil' thing. Assad also sat in his comfy chair as women and children were attacked with chemical weapons. The allied bombing is restricted to military sites, not civilian.Do these look like “military sites” to you, Anon? Cause they sure as hell look civilian to me.Do these…… people…… live in…… “military sites”, Anon?This literally just happened. It’s 6AM in Damascus right now. As the sun rises and reporters and military personnel begin relaying information as to the reality on the ground to the wider world, we will get a larger, more accurate picture.But I ask again: do these look like “military sites”?Remember all those years ago, seems like a lifetime now, when Gaddafi dropped the USD and instead attempted to create a pan-African economy based on oil and gold in Africa, and then he was murdered by a coalition of western nations providing air support for Islamist terrorists? And then how Assad, in an attempt to deal with Syria’s rampant hyperinflation, dropped the USD as well, and then, all of a sudden, western coalition aircraft were bombing Syria and Islamist terrorists were occupying vast swathes of land?This is not difficult. The truth is obvious to those who spend even half a second considering the evidence.The people of Syria are weary after 7 years of war, and today they’ve woken up to Daesh attacking southern Damascus as coalition aircraft bomb cities throughout the country. And you tell me “the bombing is restricted to military sites”? No. Just no.
