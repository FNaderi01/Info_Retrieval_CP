History[edit]
The Pontifical Council was established by Pope Paul VI on 15 July 1971 and was based in the Palazzo San Callisto, on Piazza San Callisto, Rome.
Effective 1 January 2017, the work of the Council was assumed by the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development, into which it was merged by Pope Francis.[1]
Description[edit]
The name of the pontifical council means "one heart", which Paul VI explained in 1972: "So we were able to give your ecclesial action for aid the name of one heart, a heart that beats in rhythm with the heart of Christ, whose pity for the hungry multitudes reaches them even in their spiritual hunger".[2]
Its mission was "the care of the Catholic Church for the needy, thereby encouraging human fellowship and making manifest the charity of Christ", and it undertook this mission by carrying out humanitarian relief operations following disasters, fostering charity and encouraging cooperation and coordination of other Catholic organizations.
