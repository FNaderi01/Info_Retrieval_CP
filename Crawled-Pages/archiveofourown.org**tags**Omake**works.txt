    Summary
      Stands shown so far in the world of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Shadowed Suspicion, as well as their powers and, well.  Me goofing around in Champions Online to get 'pictures' of said Stands, or attempting to draw them myself.  Note: Not the best art in the world.

      "This," Tobirama told the grave. "Is your fault. A time traveler! It should be you dealing with this Hashirama, you'd at least find it amusing."He studiously ignored how it was him that started playing with Time-Space ninjutsu first. It was his brother's fault.Somehow.."You!" Kama growled.Sakumo blinked at the, now, eighteen year old. "Me?""I got a page in the bingo book," the teen said, apropos of nothing. "Do you know what they call me? The 'White Fang’s Blood-Soaked Shadow’."

    Summary
      He would kill anyone to keep her safe. It’s always struck her as unfair; if he were to die saving her, then the honor—the privilege—of killing him herself would be taken from her. And that simply won’t do. If she lost that, lost out in seeing something other than amusement, than blood lust, bleeding from his eyes while he bleeds to death for all he’s done—well, then she would have nothing.
