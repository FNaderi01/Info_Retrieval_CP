    Summary
      Inosuke has a lot of talents. Hunting, fishing, skinning animals and creating fires. He knows which berries are tasty and which ones killed weaker animals. What plants made your skin all itchy upon touching them. He's the best at everything involving nature and survival.So, who cares if he can't write? Zenitsu's pretty handwriting won't save him from a beating. "It's just teasing." Tanjiro insists but he’s sure teasing in the way Tanjiro described it to him shouldn’t twist his heart like this. "Don't take it to heart.""Whatever!" He growls, turning away to stomp off in a fit of temper. Writing was a waste of time! What use is the ability to write a bunch of letters if he can’t read them? But the words don't make it out.He doesn’t want stupid Bonitsu to make fun of him again.Inosuke doesn't know when Zenitsu got the power to hurt him with words but he knows he hates the way he feels when he's being called an idiot. So, he keeps his mouth shut, hoping to take his secret to the grave. He won't give Kenitsu another reason to talk down on him. Because no matter what he insists on, Inosuke isn't dumb. He isn't.It works until Zenitsu brings it back up.
