The words were spoken so softly, Regulus struggled to hear them above the roar of the crowd, and yet he managed to catch the only words that had been spoken by his new husband. Regulus believed him to, he believed that it would be hard to try and love the man he had been forced into marriage with.

    Summary
      Hiei's life is turned upside down when a faulty condom leaves him pregnant with Kurama's baby. But the changes and challenges a pregnancy brings are only the tip of the iceberg; old family secrets, the rest of the gang's surprising behavior, and a horrible shock all threaten the foundation of the expecting couple's world. Hiei finds that life has only one constant: nothing ever stays the same. And in a world where everything else seems to be spiraling out of his control, his little one might be the one thing he can hold on to...Chapter 23: Hiei, Kurama, and Yusuke come up with a way to deal with "belly-grabbers"; Kuwabara gets roped into a hula concert; Shizuru and Botan tie the knot in a sort of hybrid demon/human wedding, with Yukina and Keiko as attendants.

    Summary
      Inspired by; Castle on the Hill by Ed Sheeran.~~~~~Anastasia huffed, a smirk twitching at her lips as she gestured towards a classroom down the hall. “Especially because I did detention in there at least once a week. I can’t even tell you how many times I was brought to look at these pictures by teachers I’d irritated and told I’d never see my face up there if I didn’t start conforming and stop pretending I couldn’t understand English anytime somebody said something I didn’t like or assigned work I didn’t feel like doing.”“You still pretend you don’t understand English whenever somebody says something you don’t like or asks you to do something you don’t feel like doing.” She chuckled. “You did it this morning when I asked you why, at your age, you still thought cheesecake was an appropriate breakfast food.”Anastasia blinked at her and when she spoke, she purposely thickened her accent and did her best to look clueless to what she’d just said. “I don’t understand.”All the blood in Kamilah’s body rose to her cheeks and an amused sigh escaped from the back of her throat. “You have no business being this adorable. Stop it at once.”“Either make me or spank me.”

    Summary
      Jinyoung was unable to overcome writer's block. He had his own revenge story to work on in real life. The author created for himself a plot in which hatred and love shared the same road, the same body, the same address, and the same name, Mark Tuan. A supposed suicide note that encouraged Jinyoung to take justice in his own hands, ended up leading him to a web of violence, intrigues, crime and passion.

    Summary
      This story delves into the mystery of where the HELL Maya Fey and Miles Edgeworth were when Phoenix Wright's world collapsed around him post disbarment and WHY they weren't at his side during Phoenix's darkest hour for those long seven years. Join Phoenix, Maya, Miles, Franziska and the rest of your favourite Ace Attorney characters for nearly a decade and experience with them both their laughter and tears, as they discover life's bittersweet truths: sometimes love isn't enough to mean happily ever after, all the money in the world can't necessarily fix all tragedies, justice doesn't always prevail, and broken hearts heal...but can they ever truly mend? Follows the Ace Attorney Timeline for the most part and goes through AJ to Post DD. Slight spoilers for all games. This is the final installment of the Turnabout Lawful Love Trilogy and takes place right where Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman ended. The story starts pre-Apollo Justice, right before Phoenix's disbarment. Official part 3 of the Turnabout Lawful Love Trilogy.

      Inspired by; Tell Me by Johnny Jewel ft. Saoirse Ronan.~~~~~“We’re jumping into the ocean whilst fully clothed, come on,” Adrian said without elaborating on why anyone would do such a thing.“Awesome!,” Anastasia laughed as she looped an arm through hers. It never ceased to amaze her how excited her wife was to do simple things like this, she really had no business being this adorable. It was simply fact.“It was Lily’s idea,” Serafine shrugged. Far be it from her to veto a stupid plan.Kamilah scoffed and looked down at her perfectly tailored suit. When she spoke, her words were really more of an irritated grumble, “I am wearing Armani haute couture.”“Who peed in your Cheerios?,” Lily pouted.She sighed and moved her mouth to Anastasia’s ear and whispered, “This is exactly why you should’ve let me bring my daggers. She has somehow drank twelve cocktails in the past hour and now wants to drown herself and us in the process... this seems like a knives situation.”

    Summary
      If you have found this story and not read the first installment or the second, please do so.  The existing plot points, characters and establishment of their lives will matter.  We are entering a time in Queen's history that contains many triumphs but will soon lead to a road of tragedy and loss.  The band is at the top of their game as they begin recording their next album.  But the strain of 10 years together is starting to show.  Creative tension and the need to keep up with the pace of a rock &amp; roll lifestyle will begin to create problems.  A new darkness is emerging in the world that will have an enormous impact on all their lives.  It will threaten everything that matters and cause each of them to react in ways they could never imagine.  Will the group survive all the turmoil?  Will Brian and Roger survive the stresses placed on their relationship?  And - what will be the final thing that makes Brian and Roger willing to reveal their most sacred secret to the world?  I hope you will join me for a dramatic journey through the 80's...one filled with love, laughter, tears, mistakes, forgiveness and remembering what matters most...friends will be friends...right til the end.
