    Summary
      “... Where am I?” Yibo asks. He’s almost afraid to hear the answer.  The first man scoffs. “You must have gotten drunk and can’t even remember where you are!” he says scornfully. “Youth these days, absolutely no manners. We’re in Gusu, of course.”What? “Gusu?” Yibo repeats faintly. “That can’t be right.” or: You ever pine after someone so hard that you just need to be punted across universes to get your feelings straightened out? Well, Yibo has.

    Summary
  Framed by the soft morning light, sleek hair swept back and pale blue robes not even slightly rumpled, he looks almost inhuman.
  He looks like the last person who should be knocking on Wei Wuxian’s door.
In which Wei Wuxian is a curse worker secretly searching for a lost dragon, Lan Wangji is his new assistant, and the two things may not be entirely unrelated.
