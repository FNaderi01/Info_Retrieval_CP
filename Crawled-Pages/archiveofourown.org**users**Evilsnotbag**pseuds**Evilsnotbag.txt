  Summary
    In this AU Lilith is a teacher at Hexside as well as the leader of the Emperor's Coven.This starts off with two stories that can be stand alone. From part three and onward it's more of an actual series and I would recommend reading the parts in order, for context.What is it about? Found family, a serious amount of angst and a big helping of hurt/comfort. Periods and body pains (fibromyalgia) are recurring themes. Also dysfunctional family relationships, including but not limited to the Blight family. Lumity is the endgame here. Slowest of slowburns.Edit: I started writing this series thinking Eda was the older sister, and I'm keeping it that way in this AU... since it's already an AU.

    Summary
      Geralt of Rivia labours under the burden of a deadly curse - which Jaskier can easily help him to break, it's just terribly embarrassing to ask him.Considering that "First Time Bottoming" is one of the tags.(Takes place at an indeterminate point after the unpleasantness on the mountain, but before any other major narrative events arise.)

    Summary
      “Belos gave me a choice. He told me to get rid of Luz, one way or another. And I did. Now everyone’s back in the realm they belong in, nobody got hurt and Luz is forever out of danger. It’s best for everyone involved that way.”“Keep telling yourself that, Lily.” Eda glared daggers at her sister. “Oh, and solid job on locking your own protégée out of the Boiling Isles, by the way.”“What are you talking about?”“Amity went through the door after Luz,” Emira chimed in. Her voice was scarily monotone. “Now she’s trapped on the other side of the portal you just destroyed.”—Summer has come to an end, which means Luz is forced to return from ‘summer camp’ and resume her regular life back at home with her mom. When she leaves, she promises she’ll be back soon.Unable to overcome her fear of telling Luz how she feels about her before she steps through the door, Amity finally finds the courage to do it when the door closes behind Luz and makes the rash decision to follow her.Then something goes wrong, and now Amity is stuck in Luz’s realm with her crush, far away from everything she’s ever known.Getting back home might prove more difficult than she’d originally hoped...
