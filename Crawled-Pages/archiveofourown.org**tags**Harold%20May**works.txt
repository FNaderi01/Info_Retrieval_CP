    Summary
      If you have found this story and not read the first installment or the second, please do so.  The existing plot points, characters and establishment of their lives will matter.  We are entering a time in Queen's history that contains many triumphs but will soon lead to a road of tragedy and loss.  The band is at the top of their game as they begin recording their next album.  But the strain of 10 years together is starting to show.  Creative tension and the need to keep up with the pace of a rock &amp; roll lifestyle will begin to create problems.  A new darkness is emerging in the world that will have an enormous impact on all their lives.  It will threaten everything that matters and cause each of them to react in ways they could never imagine.  Will the group survive all the turmoil?  Will Brian and Roger survive the stresses placed on their relationship?  And - what will be the final thing that makes Brian and Roger willing to reveal their most sacred secret to the world?  I hope you will join me for a dramatic journey through the 80's...one filled with love, laughter, tears, mistakes, forgiveness and remembering what matters most...friends will be friends...right til the end.

    Summary
      This is a sequel to - You've Got To Hide Your Love Away.  This new story picks up in early 1975 and continues the love story of two aspiring musicians who found love together under unusual circumstances.  I encourage you to read the first story to fully enjoy this sequel due to original characters, character development and existing plotlines.   Brian and Roger fell in love and have stayed together against all odds.  They struggled through the hardships of forming their band and seeing it rise to success.  1975 holds the promise of real fame and fortune.  It has been hard to hide their love away from the public.  Can they keep it private or will the pressures of fame and fortune drive them apart?  They are preparing to return to America in hopes of completing a tour. Everything is looking up for the band and these two as a new year begins.  Their professional career is taking off and the world is at their feet but their personal lives soon get hit by something completely unexpected.  Brian and Roger try to cope with a surprising addition to their lives.  Roger can't deal with the changes in his life and Brian finds himself questioning everything he thought about who they are together.  Can their relationship survive?

      A nigh unsinkable ship, she was called. Touted by the newspapers as, for certain. White Star had outdone itself with this beauty and she sets out into a fog that breaks round Southampton into a blue and sunny morn, across the upper Atlantic and onward towards America, bringing hopes for new lives with her.Brian May is one who hopes - tentatively - that he shall go on and be better, though leaving home ain't easy. He's got a good friend who helps him, though. And there are certain to be some surprises in store aboard the majestic RMS Titanic. On a ship of dreams, anything can happen.
