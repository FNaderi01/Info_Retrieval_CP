            Third Time’s The Charm - Prologue        Author’s Note (it’s going to be long, I am so sorry): I’ve had this story brewing in my mind for a little over a year, but it wasn’t until I was DM’ing in January with @sassy-sassenach over a post (that is relevant to this story!) that we were both fangirling over that I thought: hm. Maybe I could write this? So, a thank you to her for encouraging me and thinking of me during this initial writing process!A few more thank you’s to some people who have the patience of saints and the willingness to sit through hours of me talking about this story:@smashing-teacups, who graciously offers her experience in the medical field to help my plots and who lets me fire away random words at her when I was thinking of this title.@suzannevvale​ and @balfey​ for letting me spill out countless ideas for these two soulmates to y’all and for being the best encouragers.@ladyviolethummingbird, for her routine check-ins on me and my story. They mean so much, more than you’ll know!and @desperationandgin, for your fantastic encouragement.This is a story that is so near and dear to my heart, and I hope it finds a place among the wonderful fic in the Outlander community for you readers to enjoy. The story continues below the cut. Here we go!Third Time’s The Charm: Jamie and Claire are reunited in 1764 after nearly 18 years apart. They make the decision to settle down in Edinburgh, and life gives them another chance at a dream long denied to them. (AO3)June 1766His body felt every bit of his forty-five years of age as he gracelessly chased the squealing toddler around his shop. Ever since she had learned to walk just before her first birthday, her tiny yet chubby legs propelled her everywhere she desired to go. His clothes were covered in soot after a long day of printing, but that didn’t stop him from trying to make her laugh as loudly as possible, even though he knew her mother would have words for him for getting the tiny mischief-maker’s dress dirty.“Mo chuisle, a leannan, I’m coming for ye!”She shrieked in delight at his teasing and her running proved futile as he scooped her up in his arms. He kissed her relentlessly on her cheeks, realizing that although her dark curly hair would likely hide any trace of his failure to clean up before taking her into his arms, her dirt-covered face would nevertheless give him away.He heard a sudden gasp from above, and his eyes immediately locked with those of a young woman standing on the balcony overlooking his printing press. With fiery red hair peaking out underneath the hood of a plum cloak, her eyes conveyed a haunting sense of familiarity that he struggled to rationalize.Realizing it was no longer just him and the wee spitfire, he cleared his throat and adopted a somewhat professional demeanor. “Good evenin’, can I help ye, mistress?” He adjusted his grip on the bairn, who currently had her arms wrapped tightly around his neck as if holding on for dear life, and propped her on his hip. As he walked up the stairs towards the visitor, his mind began to fight against the frighteningly supernatural sense that overwhelmed his thought process:  You know this lass.“I—” she started, seemingly unable to decide how she wanted continue her sentence. “I….it’s you two that I’m looking for.”Confused by the stranger’s direct statement and the unusual accent formulating her words, he briefly glanced down at the whisky eyes innocently staring back at him before focusing back on the woman.“I’m sorry, mistress, but ye’ve caught me by surprise. I’m no’ sure what ye mean.”“Are you Jamie Fraser?”Now at a closer distance, he studied the blue in her familiar eyes as her gaze met his, its steadiness undermined by the lass’s wringing hands.“Aye,” he confirmed along with a nod, further unsettled by this visitor’s acknowledgment of his name. “Are ye in need of somethin’ from me?”The confidence in her stare vanished as she took a step back. Her clearly evident nerves began to take a toll on his own heart rate, but he didn’t want to further scare the poor young woman. She looks so much like my mother, he fleetingly thought, hoping that the eerily similar physical comparison adequately explained why goosebumps had slowly traveled down his arms from the moment he saw her.“Have ye a message for me, lass?” January 1764, two and a half years earlier “Pardon?” I nervously blurted out, reaching my hand to gently touch the shoulder of the delivery boy that looked as if he might know about Jamie’s whereabouts. “I’m looking for a printer. Mr. Malcolm. Alexander Malcolm?”“Aye!” he answered, his eyes reflecting his immediate shift from confusion to recognition. “He’s located at the end of Carfax Close, which’ll be the first on yer left.”With that quick confirmation, my heart froze. I realized that I had long been preparing myself for the likelihood that I’d reach a dead end in my quest to find Jamie — that my hope of finding him would never truly materialize, but would instead remain within the four corners of the copy of the printed poem firmly grasped in my hands.After thanking the boy and watching him walk away, I took a deep breath to steady myself. It seemed almost pointless to do so at this juncture, as my racing heartbeat and shaking hands indicated that I wouldn’t be leaving this stage of adrenaline anytime soon. I grabbed my glasses from my coat pocket and placed them on the tip of my nose, fondly remembering that Brianna had been the one to pick these out for me and my tiring eyes a few years ago.                                               ———————-Frank had died in a car accident ten years after Jamie sent me back through the stones. Ironically, I was on the clock at the local hospital on the same night he was brought into our emergency room. As I left a final check-in with a patient whose surgery had thankfully produced no complications, I heard a soft “Claire” come from Joe, my dear friend and colleague. The fact that he called me by my Christian name and not the playful Lady Jane nickname that he had based solely on my apparently posh accent was the first warning sign. The second stemmed from the tone in which he said my name — the same tone that we, as young doctors, learned to adopt when communicating tragic news to worried loved ones.“It’s Frank,” Joe continued. “He was brought here after paramedics discovered him at the scene. It was a car accident. He— he was dead on arrival. I’m so, so sorry, Claire.”I still remember nothing between the moment after Joe broke the news to me and the realization of finding myself sitting in a cold, narrow, echo-filled room with white-tiled walls and a standard linoleum-patterned floor. Sitting next to a body, laid out on a metal stretcher, that once held my first husband’s charm, intelligence, disdain, resentment, and grief-filled and eventually unrequited love for me.As I carefully studied Frank’s face for what I knew would be the last time, I grew paralyzed by a wave of conflicting emotions. A sense of love for him that had undeniably evolved over the past thirteen years, beginning the moment I first traveled through the stones during our second honeymoon in Scotland. It was a love that was no longer romantic, but instead nostalgic and supported by a foundation of likely undeserved gratitude towards him. A deeply-rooted pang of guilt for never completely re-immersing myself in the reality of Claire &amp; Frank  — a guilt that stemmed from the belief that, in my inability to irreversibly shut the door on the most powerful thing I had ever experienced, I let both Jamie and Frank down. A heart-shattering realization that Brianna’s tenth birthday would be her last with the man she lovingly knew as her father.However, the feeling that came the most naturally at that moment was the one I would deny the quickest. A feeling that would stay buried, never to be recognized again. Relief. Frank’s passing released the verbal muzzle he had placed on me when we started our new life together. I had lived a decade without uttering a single word or phrase that could reasonably be traced back to Jamie Fraser. I had tried to apply the same rigor of mental training I developed in medical school to the inevitably futile task of wiping my memory clean of any treasured memories of my life with Jamie. I had remained complicit in the heartbreaking lie regarding Brianna’s parentage. I had fulfilled every requirement of Frank’s cruel conditions, and now I was free.                                         ————————Seven years after Frank’s passing, I was back in 1764, glancing down at the paper in my hands and skimming the already-memorized words printed by one Alexander Malcolm. A. Malcolm, Jamie’s pseudonym in Edinburgh — a discovery made by Roger Wakefield, a young historian that Brianna and I met during a week in Scotland that changed both of our lives. Shortly after her fifteenth birthday, I took Brianna to Inverness and told her everything about her father. Jamie Fraser. The man who destroyed his own heart for our protection. The proud Highlander who, until a month ago, I believed had died on the battlefields in Culloden.Brianna and I had carefully rebuilt our collective history over the two years following that fateful trip, a process filled with questions she asked that I never hesitated to answer. We slowly accepted Jamie’s fate as part of our own familial narrative, but the curious Mr. Wakefield never did. He kept researching, kept venturing down promising paths — which is how I found myself, on Christmas Eve in 1965, with unimpeachable proof that Jamie was still alive. He had beaten death in battle and in prison. He was a free man, working as a printer for the main newspaper in town, The Edinburgh Advertiser.This earth-shattering discovery resulted in a month-long campaign of constant encouragement from Brianna for me to go back and find Jamie. The thought had undeniably crossed my mind the second it registered that Jamie was alive in his own time, but I never seriously considered the possibility of returning to him until my daughter — our daughter — began making the ultimate push. Joe and Gail unconditionally vowed to take care of Brianna, both of them having been let in on the secret of my strange journey back in time (which included a blunt observation from Joe himself: I always knew Brianna had so much of you and so little of Frank).Brianna never failed to remind me that she would miss me. That bittersweet tinge was constantly present in her voice, even when she would quip about how she was “all grown up” — how she wanted me around, but didn’t need me like she did when she was younger. But she always ended each remark with the same conclusion: Jamie gave you to me, now I’m giving you back to him. And you get to tell him everything about me. At the end of January 1966, I made the journey two-hundred-and-two years back in time, carrying nothing but a small and hidden arsenal of modern-day treasures and necessities that I could never leave behind.She weighed heavily on my mind as I turned onto Carfax Close. Our beautiful daughter, the perfect creation of my and Jamie’s lives. Brianna was the one reassurance that my years with Jamie were true and undoubtedly mine. I brought pictures of her with me, tucked safely in one of my many pockets, and I prayed that Jamie would want to see them. I had no idea what his life looked like now, but I hoped that I was still enough for him.At the heart of Carfax Close, I spotted a wrought iron sign dangling in front of a tall wooden staircase that led to the shop’s entrance. A. Malcolm, Printer, Edinburgh Advertiser. My heartbeat quickly traveled up into my eardrums as I stretched out my hand and gently touched the black letters of the name. Jamie’s name.A. Malcolm. Alexander Malcolm.Removing my hand, I forced myself up the stairwell before the frayed thread of courage keeping my will together had the chance to snap. Once I reached the shop entrance, I removed my glasses and nervously patted down my wild curls one more time before shoving open the heavy oak door.                                          ————————“Christ!”Jamie yelled in frustration as he fought with his incredibly stubborn printing press. He had arrived just after dawn to begin his daily routine of printing several hundred copies of advertisements and essays for The Edinburgh Advertiser. However, he hadn’t accounted enough time for the lever to his main press deciding to jam; so he sent Geordie, his assistant, off to find some tools. The lad had been gone for more than an hour when Jamie finally heard the entrance doorbells chime, and he sighed in much-welcomed relief.“Took ye long enough, now get down here if ye would and help me.”When he heard neither a verbal confirmation nor the man’s usual speedy footsteps approaching, Jamie took a moment to stretch out the temporary hunchback he had developed in the battle with the lever jam. Satisfied with the melody of cracks that rippled down his aching back, he began to kneel down when he heard the words that would irrevocably change his life once again.“It isn’t Geordie.”No, he thought. That can’t be her. I’m imaginin’ her voice. I’m goin’ mad.“It’s me.” A pause. “Claire.”Oh, Christ.With his back turned away from the visitor, he shut his eyes tightly and took a few calming breaths. Keep it together. This is just another one of yer dreams. Ye’ll make it through. Just turn around. Nobody will be there, and ye can get back to reality.“Jamie?”Real or not, that pleading voice was forever a siren call to him, and he mentally prepared himself for heartbreak as he turned around. What he saw rendered him speechless.A Dhia, she was so beautiful.Her dark brown curls framed the same delicate glass face that he had fallen in love with almost twenty years ago. The golden eyes that he knew all too well contained the same combination of nervousness and hope that was reflected in her half-smile. They were both frozen at the root, neither of them wanting to budge out of fear that their eyes were truly deceiving them.Never breaking eye contact with him, Claire — or, at this point, a dangerously real vision of her — slowly descended the stairs and approached him. As she drew closer, Jamie saw the faint lines framing her eyes and mouth, reflecting a life undoubtedly hard-fought. She stopped about five feet away from him, having reached a self-imposed physical barrier, and he quickly realized that he hadn’t said a single word since setting his eyes on her.Swallowing one more time, as if to physically remove the ball of nerves constricting his voice, the corners of his mouth lifted slightly.“Sassenach, is it truly you?”Seemingly rendered speechless herself, Claire’s smile reached its full wattage as she moved closer and covered his left hand with both of hers. Her hands sought the silver-tinted “C” scar she had imprinted on him as a reminder that their life together was truly theirs. Her watery eyes followed the movements of her thumbs, gently tracing the scar, back and forth. Flinching as though an electric spark had passed between them, any notion in Jamie’s mind that Claire was merely a vision induced by long days with little sleep immediately shattered.“You’re real,” he whispered. “God in heaven, you’re real.”“So are you,” Claire softly uttered in response as she met his eyes, tears escaping her own. “I—I thought you were dead.”Jamie pulled her hard against him as they collapsed onto each other. They were both shaking, and neither could have said how long they sat there on the soot-covered floor, tears of longing spilling down both of their faces. Eighteen years apart had not erased the familiarity and rightness of having Claire in his arms, and Jamie found himself silently praying Gaelic pleas as he drew her closer to him —  Lord, thank ye for bringing her back to me. Please dinna let this be for a moment, but instead for forever. I canna live without her.“Don’t be afraid,” Claire whispered softly against his chest, likely sensing the irrational fear in his tight grip. Those words harkened Jamie back to their wedding night, the rush of memories culminating in his strange response of a mix between a choke and laugh.Stroking her cheek, he rested his head on top of hers, finishing that soothing reassurance he had told her all those years ago.“There’s the two of us now.”Next chapter

The HushA/N apparently some of you weren’t entirely satisfied with the ending of ‘The Delivery Room, and ‘ a baby cries’ so this wee vignette and drawing are for you. 😀In the dark of the night, Jamie sits back down in the wicker bedroom chair, and continues his whispers to the wee one in his arms.‘Ah, now where were we, mo nighean? Before you so rudely interrupted me with your squalling… Ye’re all dry now, so no more noise, aye? Your mother’s sleeping. Ah, yes, I was saying that ye were a bit of a surprise. It’s true. But so welcome. ‘ He places the swiftest of kisses on her head ‘We didna expect to conceive  on the honeymoon. But well, in all the excitement, pills were forgotten! ‘ The baby settles and seems to sigh in agreement.‘Aye, my wee prawn. That’s right. Get comfortable. Ye are, you ken.  All shades of red and pink, and wrinkled t’boot.’ He laughs lightly, careful not to joggle the small body held so carefully within his hands. ‘Your mother’s very fond of prawns. And of throwing them too.’ He smiles at the memory.‘You know of course already that ye have the best mother in the world. You’ve had nine months to get to know her, aye? Claire…. ‘ He chokes up, pauses while he wrestles with his emotions, all the while gently stroking his newborn daughter’s bright auburn hair, marvelling at its softness. He can’t tell whether she’s actually fallen asleep again, though her eyes are closed. ‘Claire, she loves you so so much, mo chuisle. As do I’The baby suddenly wriggles and whimpers. ‘So you’re still listening then?’More struggles.‘Aye, Wee Red, I know you’re fussing, but your Ma, she needs her rest now. She’s had quite a day of it. Yes, I ken you have too. But you’re going to have t’just make do with your Da.’ He can’t help but grin as he pronounces the last word, still hardly believing that he is holding his own child, this perfect mix of him and Claire, their love made flesh. He leans down and very gently presses his lips to his daughter’s forehead, softly, lingeringly.At this tender contact, the baby opens her eyes. Jamie knows that she is already very familiar with his voice, its bass tones. He has been telling tales of old Scotland to the bump for months. But she is still unused to his touch. His bonny bairn. His mouth twitches. All these names he has for her already. She continues to stare solemnly up at him, trying to focus.The weight of her in his hands, this warm body, so delicate, and yet so strong, infinitely precious. It seems so extraordinary that just hours ago, he had only known her as a curve within Claire, a series of movements and kicks, and now here she is. The smallest parcel of snuffles, sighs and light soughs. And the smell.  A milky sweetness that is already ingrained within his psyche. And he can’t stop looking at her. He is enchanted by the smallest details. Her perfect wee fingers. The hint of translucency within her ears. The length of her lashes. She is a miracle of life. Within the absolute quiet of the bedroom, he almost imagines he can hear her heartbeat. He can certainly feel her breathing, a series of tiny vibrations, though he canna really see it, so slight is the rise and fall of her chest.He involuntarily clasps her tighter. To love her and protect her with his very life is now his raison d’être.She’s already survived so much. The scare at 4 ½ months when Claire had had significant bleeding. Then again at 7 months, at which point she was put on bed rest for the remainder of the pregnancy. But she was strong, his wee girl, so braw, and determined. ‘Like your Ma’ he whispers into her hair.He pulls back and strokes her cheek again, and then her brow, and watches in fascination how her eyes close again, and within moments, he feels just the tiniest change in her breathing, as she falls back to the sweetest slumber, held safe in her father’s embrace.His Faith.

I spent it with Jamie’s family, creating traditions that I never thought I’d have and early on the morning of Christmas, Jamie proposed. Since then we’d gotten married, moved into our first home together and found out we were expecting. Not only expecting a child I never thought we’d have, but we were due to adopt a two year old boy in two weeks. Things were moving along so fast that it was easy to forget to stop and cherish the moments as they passed. Just last week, Jamie and I found out the sex of our baby and I’ll never forget the look on Jamie’s face.  Keep reading

5x07 Missing MomentA/N: I tried hard not to do this, but I was a little saddened we didn’t really get any Bree and Jamie stuff. Technically, Jamie’s birthday is May 1 and the Battle of Alamance happened on May 16, 1771. So there’s a two-week period where Jamie and Claire could have been at the camp. IDK if the show did or didn’t follow the timeline because we’re really not made aware of what the timeline is. So this is under the impression they were there for a while. It’s my own way of making the timeline clear. Also this is dedicated to @happytoobserve who helped spur this idea. This also goes out to @walkinginland who gave me a bit of feedback when I asked her. This is un-beta’d, so you’ve been warmed. XO.He watched the two of them from the entrance of the tent. For years he had been in the cave, dreaming of the very scene in front of his eyes. Their daughter must have said something funny, for Claire tossed her head back and laughed. It was carefree and spontaneous. Her hair fell back and traced down her shoulders, her cheeks flushing red. The sound of her laugh was like music to his ears. She was his daily reminder for why he had to do what he always had to- she was the reason he had the life that he did. The family he had- they had come from her. For a minute he could almost forget where he was. He had once longed for the day when he’d be with his family, lunch being served, and land that needed to be tended to. He had pictured Claire cooking, the best that she could, and serving him his stew. He had dreamt of having his children surround him, his grandchildren on his knee. He had that life now, yet sometimes those desires came with duties, things he’d happily oblige to do, even lay down his own life for.He’d never wished the life of a soldier upon Claire, yet she went where he did. And now, their daughter, their son-in-law, were following along with him. Though he couldn’t hear them, Claire must have retorted something funny back to their daughter, for it was Bree’s turn to let out a belly laugh. Claire said that Brianna was all the pieces that a Fraser consisted of-and she was. There was no denying who had fathered Bree. He let himself wonder for a moment how Frank could look and be reminded, daily, of the man Claire had left behind, and raise his child. He’d never know nor understand, but all he could do was be thankful. He had trusted Frank with his two most precious Earthly gifts, and the fact they were before him- alive and whole, well, he had prayed to Dougal earlier. He’d have to say a prayer of thankfulness to Frank Randall later. Keep reading

Tales From Fraser’s Ridge | Part 28 “Merry Christmas” a/n: I hope you all enjoy this special edition of TFFR – it’s a bit different but still on the ridge ;) thank you so much @julesbeauchamp for making this special and beautiful moodboard for this chapter! Missing MomentsScotland - 1952“Merry Christmas Mama!” Bree shouted at the top of her lungs as she proceeded to jump up and down on our bed. “Well, Merry Christmas to you darling,” I smiled as I came slowly awake to my very excited four year old. “Can we open presents Mama?” She suddenly plopped down between us, her red hair flying around her little cheeks. “Pweeaseeee?”“Aye, we can mo chuisle,” Jamie grinned and gave her head a pat. Bree let out an excited squeal and rolled off the bed with a thump. She was wild, always bumping into things and bruising her skin. It was a good thing I was a doctor, with a husband like Jamie and a daughter that took after him.  Keep reading

            Selkie Night        Yeah hi so you know how I was apologizing like six hours ago about how I hadn’t had any writing for you lately? well then this happened because i can’t phucken sleep dudes ahhhhhANYWAy it’s okay because I got this written in like three hours. and i actually kind of love it??? dude i mentioned my selkie Chase headcanon ONCE (1nce) today and then this sidelines me out of nowhere. i’ve literally never planned to write anything about this it was just like “hehe what if Chsae…. were SELKIE” but anyway here it is and it kind of rocks my socks off I love it. as a side note, I did take some liberties with selkie lore. don’t know what the most common beliefs are, these are just based on the stories I know of. I think most selkie stories are about falling in love with humans, but in this one Chase and Stacy are both selkie.trigger warning for some mild suicidal ideation, okay? but don’t even think about fussing at me about the nudity in this fic it could not possibly be less sexual. There is an abrupt start tho lolllAnd HEY -I hope you enjoy :) Thanks for reading, my friend.He tears off his clothes as he runs,
pulling his shirt over his head, tugging his pants off mid-stride,
stripping until, by the time his bare feet are pounding against wet
sand instead of dry, he is naked except for the coat he carries.	The wind rushes across his head,
stroking back his downy hair warmly, and the sandy earth beneath his
feet is calling to him – stay, stay, brother, child, on this
side of the water, where the men make their homes, and the tide keeps
its distance. Here you have made your dwelling for so many years.
Here you have spoken, loved, eaten, drank. Here you must stay.	No,
no. It doesn’t matter. Nothing matters but them.	“Stacy!”
he screams, as his feet find the harsh plastic of the dock. “Stacy!
Sorcha! A chuisle mo
chroí!”	He
runs, runs, runs towards the end of the dock, runs towards the
roiling black waves of the ocean, pulling his coat over his
shoulders. Ah, its weight on his back! Its warmth! How long has it
been? Tears streak his face like stars the night sky, and then he is
at the end of the dock, and he does not stop, he does not pause, does
not allow himself even a moment of doubt before he leaps, graceful as
a swan, and his body curves beautifully into a dive he has performed
a thousand times before, and when he plunges hands-first into the
frigid expanse of the great dark water, he is no longer a man.	Ah,
to be a seal again!	For a
moment, Chase can only dive on, deeper into the water, the suddenness
of the transformation leaving him, as always, momentarily numb,
momentarily taken over, the thoughts of a man doing their best to
drift out of his head. He twitches his long whiskers and swims down
through the water, now comfortably cool against his smooth, heavy
skin and fat, and no longer so dark with eyes as dark to match. His
black-and-white-dappled body cuts easily through the waves, carrying
him farther, farther out to sea, away from the noise and the light
and the smell of men, away from the other part of himself. Ah, he
drifts. He drifts.	He is
far away now. Far away from men. As if he is not one of them. Keep reading

anonymous asked:Waiting for the next chapter of The Oath ☺️☺️Coming on Wednesday, but here’s a sneak peek!The Oath - Chapter 10 sneak peek! “Are you coming to the ultrasound tomorrow?” Claire said as she sat down her plate on the coffee table. “Aye,” he smiled, his hands resting on her ankles. “Tis at ten a.m. right?”“Yes,” Claire nodded, jumping a bit as she felt a push from inside her stomach. “Oooo,” she moaned lightly. “What is it?” Jamie looked over at her, concern clear across his face. “Just a kick, don’t worry,” she smiled in assurance. “Would you like to feel?”“Aye, I would.” Claire lifted her feet off his lap so that he could move closer and he gently laid his hand over her bump, pausing as he waited to feel something. His face broke out into a thousands different emotions when in the next minute, he felt a nudge against his hand. “A leannan,” Jamie grinned, rubbing his hand over Claire’s stomach. “Mo chuisle.”

            You Will Always Have Me        This takes place between chapters 16 and 17 of my recently completed WW2 AU Vergangenheit  After her little brother has been acting strangely all day, Brianna finds him in the old tree house and tries to banish his fears about the futureSeptember 1945 Brianna finds William sat in a corner of the remains of the old tree house, hands clutched around his knees, his head buried in his lap so that only a peep of fiery auburn curls are visible. The evening light is dim and dusky, the dying sun pooling against the crumbling corners of ash and elm.  The whorls of old wood are caught in a fire of dappled gold and brown against the shadows, the structure of the house still sound enough to enclose them from the wider world for a time.
