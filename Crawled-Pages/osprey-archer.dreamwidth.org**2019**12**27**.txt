Always Be My MaybeDec. 27th, 2019 09:51 am
MY FRIENDS, I finally watched Nahnatchka Khan’s Always Be My Maybe, and I would be kicking myself for not watching it sooner except that that I’m too glad to have finally watched it to be kicking myself for anything. I can’t remember the last time I laughed so hard at a movie. The chemistry between Sasha and Marcus (Ali Wong and Randall Park) is phenomenal, not just romantically but in terms of banter; would 100% watch a series of films that’s just the two of them sparking off each other like a modern-day Nick and Nora Charles. And this struck me as one of the few films that I’ve seen that really captures the Millennial style of speaking, so it felt like watching a couple of my friends have a movie-length conversation (or, you know, the good parts version: less ums and ahs, more scintillating wit). The secondary characters were also vivid, like Sasha’s friend/restaurant manager Veronica (Sasha is a celebrity chef, jetting around the country opening new restaurants), or the members of Marcus’s band Hello Peril (yes, I know), who have been playing together for sixteen years - and you can feel the weight of that history even though we don’t see very much of the band. And of course Keanu Reeves as an over-the-top version of himself (at least, I’m assuming it’s over the top??) brings down the house. But at the same time, I think this is the one stumbling point in the movie - not Keanu himself, but the fact that his scenes are so high-powered that the movie loses some of its impetus after that. Sasha and Marcus get together, and then… the movie drifts a bit, and then they have one last argument, and then they pull it all together for the finale. Also, there are some amazing food scenes.
