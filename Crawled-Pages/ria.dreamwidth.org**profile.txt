                about meWell, he sits down with a grin. "Why little Alice, where've you been?Not so little, not so Alice, now, are you?"As he sips my untouched drink, I say, "I can't be who I think."He says, "You are, and you're not, and I am too.Are we figments of our gin? Are we long-lost orphaned kin?Or the mad descendants of a writer's pen?No one's sane behind their mask. Ask what you really want to ask."- The Girl that's Never Been, Michelle Dockrey [lyrics]Hi, I'm Ria.  I exist.  Apparently.I'm in my twenties.  I like to sleep a lot, buy too many books, and write.  I'm currently working on a book about a teen werewolf whose life turns upside down in a short space of time.  I spend too much money and things catch my eye far too easily.♣ Layout by thefulcrum♣ Tukiji Nao moodtheme made by jiatra in obsessiveiconsProfile codes &amp; images by coloriages
