    Summary
      A canon divergence from part 1 of this series and of UA season 1; this will make more sense if you read up to Chapter 9 of part 1.After season 1 of UA, Five mistakenly jumps into a universe where witches and wizards exist. Where they bring the GoT characters into their world, and then make them react to Hamilton and various other things. I suck at summaries alright, sue me.

    Summary
      General Hux tries to search for “kyber” on the holonet but it is mistyped as “kylux”. He is scarred for life and determined to destroy the strange planet of Tumblr that has produced such atrocities. He finds an unlikely ally in Rey, who isn’t too happy to find out about Reylo either. (She only just moved in with Rose.) Rose is reluctant to promote censorship despite her concerns for her girlfriend, but when Hux introduces her to “Roux/GingerRose” she is out for blood.But others concerned about the fate of their own blogs and entertainment convince them to leave the site mostly intact but ban “adult content”. The journey to another galaxy far away to announce their demands and enforce them is a struggle, but after all Hux has planet-destroying weaponry and Rey has a lightsaber and Force-choking powers. Rose has attitude and a taser. The odd, backward planet of “Earth” shall bow to the combined might of the First Order and the Resistance.Gratuitous social and political commentary, inspired by the Great Tumblr Purge of 2018.Because “female-presenting nipples” sounds exactly like something Hux would say with a sneer.

    Summary
      Alexander Hamilton had always known he was going to do great things or die trying. Still, he didn’t expect to get plays made in his name. Or to be kidnapped by a mad witch from the future and made to watch said play with no chance of escape. Yet, there he was.(Discontinued)

    Summary
      It's a remake on this: https://archiveofourown.org/works/16392719?view_full_work=true but I think I'll actually finish this one lmao. A select few of characters react to fanfiction. The fanfiction can be real events in this universe, or it could be fake. If it's fake, the host (read to know who that is) will state that before the fanfic starts. The fanfics will be in bold!
