	  These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.   That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved.  
Then the Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page's authors.
The goal is to fix all broken links on the web.

		Collection: Wikipedia Near Real Time (from IRC)
	  This is a collection of web page captures from links added to, or changed on, Wikipedia pages. The idea is to bring a reliability to Wikipedia outlinks so that if the pages referenced by Wikipedia articles are changed, or go away, a reader can permanently find what was originally referred to.
This is part of the Internet Archive's attempt to rid the web of broken links.

13 Jun 2018
  A prominent Chinese-born academic has lost an appeal against Singapore’s decision to expel him for allegedly being an “agent of influence” for a foreign government, the interior ministry said on Wednesday.
Huang Jing – a US citizen who worked at leading postgraduate school the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy – and his wife were stripped of their Singapore permanent residency status on August 4.
Authorities accused him of working as “an agent of influence of a foreign country”, and trying to use his prominent position to influence Singapore’s foreign policy.
His wife was accused of being aware of his activities.
They did not say which government he was accused of working for but the scholar has written extensively on China and regularly contributed to state-run media.
What Singapore is saying by expelling China hand Huang Jing
Huang and his wife appealed the government’s move but the Ministry of Home Affairs said on Wednesday it had rejected their challenge.
Huang told the South China Morning Post he was not surprised that the appeal was rejected.
“I will go back to North Virginia for a rest before planning the next step,” he said.
The pair “will have to leave Singapore within a stipulated grace period”, a ministry statement said, adding both will be permanently banned from coming back to the city state.
It did not say how long the grace period was.
Chinese-American professor and his wife to be expelled from Singapore
After news broke of the Singapore government’s decision to revoke his permanent residency status, Huang told the Post the allegations against him were “nonsense”.
Huang’s case comes at a time Singapore and China’s historically warm ties are being tested.
There were tensions earlier this year when Hong Kong seized nine Singapore armoured troop carriers as they returned to the city state after conducting military exercises in Taiwan.
