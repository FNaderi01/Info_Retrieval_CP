    Summary
      Asami's eyes widened as he came face to face with the misfortunate captive. What surprised him though, wasn't the godlike beauty the other presented, nor that he was in heat.What happened to come as a shock to them all was the fact that he was reacting to him. But while the shock faded away, it gave way to possesiveness and his eyes narrowed, a growl sounding from his throat.Mate!

    Summary
      Updated summary:For almost his entire existence, Akihito had no voice in the choices in his life, including his entanglement with Asami.Akihito thought for too long what his life would be like if he wasn't in a relationship with Asami, if he could even call what they had a "relationship."Until Akihito finally decides he's done with others running over his life. He was taking back control over himself, starting with making his thoughts on Asami into reality.Or, where Akihito decides to leave Asami and make a BAMF out of himself.

    Summary
      貓科人類 + 娛圈設定。主角是米飛模特。(麻秋只是副的，出場機會不多)貓科人類設定來自左京亞也老師的《黑貓男友系列》，基本上就是獸人。(順便安利一下攻君好帥好帥，攻君的哥哥&amp;侄子好可愛)地球上有0.01%的人有貓科基因，平常人模人樣的，興奮起來/做得起勁時班紋、爪子、尾巴和耳朵會冒出來，也可以完全獸化。也有基因不完全導致只能半獸化，和普通人類混血所以連耳朵尾巴都沒有的等等。最重要的是獸化後衣服會掉下來，變回人型之後就是光著的囉，很符合物理定律對不對？ 不過除了這個設定和都是娛圈相關之外，本文和《黑貓男友》沒什麼關係，所以就不打黑貓tag啦 (話說我也找不到黑貓的tag...)

    Summary
      I am alone. I was alone. Then I found others like me.We stopped caring about people who didn't like us. We had gone through a time when others tried to be like us. We were part of something bigger, better, stronger, more powerful. No one could stop us. Then one day we disappeared and too this day no one knows where we are. What happened to us. All they're left with is lives saved and killed. We became regular, falsed normal. But none of us would ever forget, left in memory we will always remember, we will always be connected through what we left behind. A bond far stronger than family more thicker than blood. Though perhaps we suppose, we aren't ready to let go yet. Maybe we never will. Maybe he never will either.Akihito’s left behind that life, as did everyone else he new. But a new threat brings them all back together again. This time they’re here to stay. (A/N: Sorry if the summery sucks!😣)

    Summary
  „Wirst du zurückkehren?“Eine einfache Frage und doch weicht ein unwilliger Laut aus meiner ausgedörrten Kehle. Die Antwort ist nein. Ich werde nicht zurückkehren. Ich lasse mich nicht erpressen. Ich habe mich für das Hierbleiben entschieden. 
 Asami ist kein beliebter Mann. Menschen hassen ihn für seine Taten. Er kann damit leben, nicht jedoch, wenn es Akihito ist, der den Preis dafür bezahlt.
