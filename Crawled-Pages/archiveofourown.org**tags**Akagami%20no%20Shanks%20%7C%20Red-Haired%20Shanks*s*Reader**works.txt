    Summary
      Devlin is a hyperactive, happy-go-lucky pirate who grew up with Portgas D. Ace and Monkey D. Luffy.  Orphaned at a young age, Monkey D. Garp took her in and raised her alongside his grandsons.  While Luffy dreams of becoming the Pirate King and Ace dreams of finding the One Piece for Whitebeard, Devlin dreams of one day joining the crew of her childhood crush Red-Haired Shanks, who promised her that if she can defeat him in battle one day she can join his crew.  Join her as she travels the Grand Line in search of adventure and Shanks.  She'll make new friends and meet up with old ones.  Including Ace, who has been in love with the hyperactive blonde girl since they were little.  Will Devlin develop feelings for her once best friend and give up her dream of joining Shanks' crew?  Or will she continue to chase after the elusive Red-Haired Shanks in a foolhardy attempt to defeat the powerful Yonko and earn his love?
