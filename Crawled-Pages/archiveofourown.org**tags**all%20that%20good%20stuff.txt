    Summary
      Its the new year, high schoolers are going back to school and life is going on normally. Except Ciel Phantomhive realizes something weird about his Dance and Music teacher. Maybe it was the black hair or red eyes. Or maybe it was the fact that he made his heart race out of his little chest. Who knows? So curious and frustrated about the reason, Ciel in his own little way investigates his teacher, Mr. Michaelis...BUT will his friends get in the way? Will the fact that he's only 15 ruin everything that he slowly wants? I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE KUROSHITSUJI CHARACTERS AND I KNOW I'M NOT DOING THEY'RE REAL AGE. (Really they're only a year older and stuff) THIS IS JUST A WORK OF FICTION AND STUFF. AND BE WARNED, UNDERAGED SMUT SHALL BE IN HERE :D

    Summary
      In a small crevice of California, there is a school. But this is no ordinary school, no. This is a special school, for those who have trouble at traditional schools. Aliens, misfits, and those with powers alike. All are welcome, but few know of this school. Some are put there because they were bullied. Some are there because they're just different. Some are there because they are truly special, or truly different, or truly horrid. This is a place where a boy with electric-based telekinetic powers can fall in love at first sight with his new classmate, who is hiding parts of his neck and head, allowing no one to see. This is a place where best friends can stay friends, or become something much more.Yes, this is truly a place. A place where anyone and everyone is welcome.Some truly strange things are bound to happen, so just read on... (Btw, the first chapter is just me explaining my headcanons for the characters, but you can skip that if you want.)

    Summary
  Fuck Niall, honestly.  Fuck him for telling Zayn about this – he of all people should know that despite his leather-jacket-and-cigarette façade, underneath it all Zayn is just a hopeless romantic.  And when dealing with hopeless romantics you can’t go serving mysterious, hunky, salt-water-washed strangers up on a silver platter.  You just can’t.
It's a simple concept, really: Take a photo, then leave a photo.  But, like most simple things, Zayn manages to make it much more complicated.  So by the time Zayn meets Liam for the first time, he's been carrying a picture of him around in his pocket for nearly five months.
