                                By Education Next

            Josh Goodman of the Harvard Kennedy School sits down with Paul E. Peterson to discuss a new master’s degree in computer science offered by Georgia Tech. The computer science department, one of the top 10 programs in the country, has set up a flexible, online program for working adults that charges only 1/6 of what an in-person master’s degree costs.
Read the full paper about the program by Josh Goodman, Julia Melkers, and Amanda Pallais.
