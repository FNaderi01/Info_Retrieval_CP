    Summary
  "Life is all memory, except for the one present moment that goes by you so quickly you hardly catch it going."
  ~Tennessee Williams
The hosts have awakened and Westworld is a free-for-all.A woman with a fragmented memory awakens in the mesa to the sight of a blood bath. On a quest to get to safety, more and more of her memory unspools from the knotted mess of fear that fuels her survival instincts. A man with the saddest near-black eyes seems to be rooted to her most vivid memories.Meanwhile, in another point in time, the young and brilliant Joy Esperanza feels listless about her future. Her occupation brings with it moral questions she isn't ready to answer while her family juggles the threat of an unavoidable tragedy waiting to strike between each breath. As everything begins to spiral out of her control, Logan Delos, as dastardly charming as the Devil himself, walks into her office.At the heart of it all stands Robert Ford and the genesis of his most beloved host: Maeve.

    Summary
      They're point technology, beautiful machines capable of unimaginable things. Artificial intelligence made for pleasure, amusement, or satisfying the unspeakable needs of mankind. They're nothing but soulless shells of what we couldn't be. So perfect, so unreachable, so empty.And yet,  she was the most virtuous being I've ever met in my life."These violent delights have violent ends. And in their triumph die, like fire and powder. Which, as they kiss, consume." - William Shakespeare.

    Summary
      Just a self-indulgent fic (or series) of canon-divergent takes at moments between dolores and william, with lots of passion and angst.Mainly I want to explore dolores remembering William, when he finds her again.  Or her remembering his older self when she sees him at the park, or when she sees him in the real world outside of the park.  Ideas along that line.Comments are always appreciated!  Y'all are too lovely.

It's William's first time back in the park after his tragic loss and he is surely going to take it all out on Dolores. Here's what really happened in the barn that night. Warnings: Pure smut, non-con, murder, violence.(I know my timelines are likely off, but go with it :P)
