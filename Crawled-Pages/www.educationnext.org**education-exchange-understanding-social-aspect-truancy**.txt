                                By Education Next

            Schools are paying increasing attention to the problem of truancy, and many states are including an indicator measuring chronic absenteeism in their accountability plans for the Every Student Succeeds Act.
In this episode, Paul E. Peterson talks with Peter Bergman about  the phenomenon of joint absences, when students have a peer with whom they systematically skip class.
Peter Bergman, Assistant Professor of Economics and Education at Teachers College, Columbia University, is the co-author, with Magdalena Bennett, of “Better Together? Social Networks in Truancy and the Targeting of Treatment.”
