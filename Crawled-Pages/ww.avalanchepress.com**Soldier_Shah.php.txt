                 Iran 
                    in the Age of the Raj
                    By David Meyler
                    August 2012
                   Iran in the latter half of the 18th century 
                    lived under the shadow of Nader Shah (and 
                    in some respects still does to this day). 
                    He was born Nader Qoli on October 22, 1688, 
                    a member of Turkic Afshar tribe. He rose to 
                    become a beg � lord or chieftain � 
                    of the Afshars, as well as one of the empire�s 
                    most skilled generals under the reign of the 
                    last of the Safavid shahs.
                          Nader Shah, by David Meyler.
                  In 1719, Mahmoud Ghilzai led an Afghan army 
                    into Iran, and in 1722 deposed 
                    the ruling Shah Sultan Husayn and had himself 
                    made emperor. This was one of the lowest points 
                    in the long history of Iran. His reign did 
                    not last, however, and in 1725 Mahmoud was 
                    assassinated by his own men, and a cousin, 
                    Ashraf, was crowned, marrying a Safavid princess 
                    in an attempt to give himself some legitimacy.
                  Nader Qoli Beg initially served with the 
                    Afghans in a campaign against the Ozbegs, 
                    but when Ashraf withheld his promised payment, 
                    he joined a revolt in 1727 with 5,000 men, 
                    in support of the Safavid heir, Tamasp II. 
                    Nader defeated the Afghans and drove them 
                    out of Khorasan. Ashraf attempted to flee, 
                    after massacring 3,000 Persians in Isfahan, 
                    but was hunted down and killed.
                  While Nader was busy in the east, Tamasp 
                    II invaded Ottoman Turkey to build up a military 
                    reputation for himself. By 1732, the shah 
                    had managed to lose Armenia and Georgia to 
                    the Turks. Nader was enraged and had the shah 
                    deposed, and replaced by Tamasp�s infant 
                    son, under the name Shah Abbas III. This clearly 
                    showed who the real power was.
                    Immediately, Nader struck back at the Ottomans 
                    and regained all the territory lost by Tamasp. 
                    Abbas died, apparently of natural causes, 
                    in 1736, and Nader, dropping all pretense, 
                    had himself crowned shah.
                  In 1738, Nader Shah launched what is likely 
                    his greatest military campaign. He invaded 
                    Afghanistan through Kandahar and captured 
                    Kabul and later Bukhara. Nader then hit Moghul 
                    India, captured and sacked Delhi, and slaughtered 
                    30,000 of its citizens. He returned to Iran 
                    with much of the Moghul treasure horde, including 
                    the famed Peacock Throne and the Koh-i Noor 
                    diamond. Nader then, in 1743, resumed the 
                    war against Turkey scoring more victories, 
                    and picking up some territory at the expense 
                    of the Russian Empire. He also built a fleet 
                    in the Persian Gulf and conquered Oman.
                  Time of Troubles
                  Nader�s domestic policy was one of 
                    increasing paranoia and cruelty. Tamasp II 
                    and his two surviving sons were murdered in 
                    1740. Nader had his own son blinded and executed 
                    many Persian nobles out of largely imaginary 
                    fears of insurrection. He also made a failed 
                    attempt to make Sunni Islam the state religion, 
                    alienating many of his Shia supporters. Finally, 
                    in 1747, while on campaign in Kurdistan, a 
                    group of his own officers attempted to assassinate 
                    him at dawn. �Better we make breakfast 
                    of him before he makes supper of us,� 
                    was their credo. The 61-year-old shah, while 
                    caught by surprise, managed to kill two of 
                    his attackers before he was overcome and killed.
                  Sometimes called the Second Alexander, the 
                    Napoleon of Iran or the last of the great 
                    Asian conquerors, Nader had expanded Iran�s 
                    boundaries to their greatest extent since 
                    the Sassanids in early medieval times. But 
                    it was not to last. Succeeded by Adil Shah, 
                    his nephew, the new emperor promptly had all 
                    of Nader�s sons and grandsons executed, 
                    save one, the 14-year-old Rukh. Adil was soon 
                    deposed by his brother, who was them deposed 
                    and murdered by his own troops. Adil was also 
                    eliminated at this time. Rukh was then made 
                    shah, deposed and blinded, then reinstated, 
                    deposed and reinstated once again.
                  In short, the empire fell into anarchy, with 
                    each of the various provincial governors ruling 
                    their own petty kingdoms. Only in the south 
                    was the warlord Karim Khan, 1753-1779, able 
                    to maintain a core territory, what is historically 
                    termed the Zand dynasty.
                  Qajar Revival
                  Upon the death of Karim, Agha Mohammad Khan, 
                    a leader of the Turkic Qajar tribe from Azerbaijan, 
                    began an attempt to reunite the empire. At 
                    the age of six Mohammad had been castrated 
                    on the orders of Adil Shah to prevent him 
                    from becoming a political rival � it 
                    didn�t work and it did not prevent Mohammad 
                    Khan from establishing a dynasty. He had been 
                    held captive for 16 years in Shiraz but managed 
                    to finally escape in 1779.
                  In a long series of campaigns, Mohammad Khan 
                    overcame all his rivals. The last of Zand 
                    dynasty, Lotf�Ali Khan, was defeated 
                    in 1794. He established the new capital at 
                    Tehran, then a small provincial town of 15,000. 
                    In 1796 Agha Mohammad led a successful expedition 
                    against the Christian Kingdom of Georgia, 
                    which was then reincorporated into Iran (raising 
                    Russian ire). He conquered Khorasan, the last 
                    centre of resistance to his authority; there 
                    the ruler Shah Rukh (the blind, non-dancing grandson of 
                    Nader Shah) was tortured to death. Mohammad 
                    Khan was formally crowned shah in 1796, but 
                    he did not long enjoy his hard won victory. 
                    The following year, he was assassinated and 
                    was succeeded by his nephew Fath Ali Shah.

                  War with Russia
                  Fath Ali ruled to 1834 and finally reestablished 
                    a degree of stability. With the aid of the 
                    able Mirza Assadolah Khan, Minister of War 
                    and the Crown Prince Abbas (or Abbas Mirza, 
                    mirza means prince � that�s the 
                    leader counter Abbas M. in Soldier Emperor), 
                    a new army based on the Napoleonic model was 
                    created. Pressure from Russia advancing into 
                    the Caucasus led to the first Russo-Persian 
                    War (1806-1813). The Russian forces generally 
                    prevailed thanks to superior artillery. Still, 
                    Abbas Mirza, using the terrain and superior 
                    tactics, managed to win a number of victories 
                    to stave off total defeat. The Treaty of Golestan, 
                    however, confirmed the earlier Russian annexation 
                    of the kingdom of Georgia, as well seeing 
                    the loss of parts of the northern Caucasus.
                  The nation began to open itself up more to 
                    European influence, and while Abbas Mirza 
                    sent Iranians abroad to study European technology, 
                    British advisors were brought into the country 
                    to further reform the army (followed by the 
                    French and Austrians in later decades). The 
                    Ottomans were stunned by the performance of 
                    the new Iranian army at the battle of Ezeroum 
                    in 1821, which confirmed the existing boundaries 
                    between the two empires.
                  Fath Ali Shah, however, then overstepped 
                    himself, leading to the second Russo-Persian 
                    War 1826-28. While the Iranian army under 
                    Abbas Mirza had proved itself a dominant regional 
                    force, it was still no match for a major power 
                    like Russia, which was able to field a much 
                    larger and better-equipped army. At the Treaty 
                    of Turkomanchai, Iran ceded much of its northern 
                    territories, the entire area north of the 
                    Aras River (comprising present-day Armenia 
                    and the Republic of Azerbaijan), and had to 
                    pay Moscow a huge war indemnity.
                  The Great Game
                  Fath Ali died in 1834 and was succeeded by 
                    his grandson Mohammad Shah. He attempted twice 
                    without success to recapture Herat, an ancient 
                    province of the Iranian empire, but long since 
                    part of Afghanistan. Here, Iran was dangerously 
                    getting drawn into the �Great Game.� 
                    Mohammad Shah was pro-Russian, and while the 
                    Afghan forces on their own were no match for 
                    the Iranian army, the Afghans had British 
                    backing (at least, while fighting the Persians).
                   Mohammad Shah died in 1848, with his son 
                    Naser-ed-Din, taking the throne. He ruled 
                    for most of the remainder of the century. 
                    Iranian designs on Herat did not end, leading 
                    to an all-out war with British India in 1856-57. 
                    There was one battle of note, the Battle of 
                    Khosab on February 8, 1856. The British won 
                    a clear tactical victory using a large square 
                    formation to beat off the Iranian cavalry. 
                    But the fighting was not as one-sided as one 
                    is led to believe from British sources, and 
                    while the British had better firearms and 
                    artillery, there were gross administrative 
                    and supply deficiencies (as was also seen 
                    in the Crimean War) that forced a British 
                    retreat.
                   Still, the defeats against Russia and Britain 
                    proved demoralizing, and Iran, while undergoing 
                    something of a cultural revival under Qajar 
                    rule, increasingly fell under the sphere of 
                    influence of its two powerful neighbours. 
                    In the political chaos following the assassination 
                    of the aging shah in 1896, Iran became a virtual 
                    colony of the Europeans, divided into a Russian 
                    and a British sphere of interest. It would 
                    not be until the 1920s, following the double 
                    cataclysms of the First World War and Russian 
                    Revolutions, before the country again gained 
                    a measure of independence. 
                  Variant: East Meets West 
                   Soldier Raj and Soldier Emperor 
                    already have provisions for linking their 
                    maps. This variant adds an overland option 
                    when playing linked scenarios. 
                  The 
                    area missing between the two maps was not 
                    great, so I made a small map overlay to add 
                    eastern Persia. While not entirely to scale, 
                    it serves as a link between the two maps. 
                    The rules for inter-map movement remain unchanged, 
                    but units can also now move overland (this 
                    opens another option to intervene in Central 
                    Asia, especially for Russia). 
                  Three new Persian land areas are added to 
                    the Soldier Emperor map: 
                   Khorasan (Fortifications 2, Money 
                    1, Manpower 1), with a mountain route connecting 
                    to Baku, a land route to Azerbaijan and mountain 
                    route to Fars. Khorasan also connects to the 
                    Soldier Raj map with a mountain route to Afghanistan.
                   Fars (Fortification 2, Money 1, Manpower 
                    2), with a mountain connection to Azerbaijan, 
                    a mountain connection to Khorasan and a land 
                    route to Baluchistan.
                   Baluchistan (Fortification 2, Money 
                    1, Manpower 1), with a land route to Fars. 
                    Bauchistan also connects to the Soldier 
                    Raj map with a land route to Baroda. 
                   The map overlay joins the southeast portion 
                    of the Soldier Emperor map with the 
                    northwest frontier of Soldier Raj. 
                    Persian forces remain unchanged.
