					Ryan Murphy is rounding out the cast for Ratched, his new Netflix series starring Sarah Paulson as a younger version of the diabolical Nurse Ratched, and it’s quite a list.
Joining Paulson will be Sharon Stone, Cynthia Nixon, Finn Wittrock, Jon Jon Briones, Charlie Carver, Judy Davis, Harriet Harris, Hunter Parrish, Amanda Plummer, and Corey Stoll. Ryan announced the new cast Monday on Instagram.
“[A] true murderers’ row of talent,” Murphy wrote in his post. “So many of these actors are supremely talented folks who Sarah and I have both longed to work with.”
Ratched is an origins story, beginning in 1947, which will follow Ratched’s (Paulson) journey and evolution from nurse to full-fledged monster. The series will track her murderous progression through the mental health care system.
Ratched scored a two-season, 18-episode, straight-to-series order at Netflix in September 2017. The film’s producer Michael Douglas is set to executive produce alongside Murphy.

The Ratched Principal Players, in alphabetical order: JON JON BRIONES, CHARLIE CARVER, JUDY DAVIS, HARRIET HARRIS, CYNTHIA NIXON, HUNTER PARRISH, AMANDA PLUMMER, COREY STOLL, SHARON STONE AND FINN WITTROCK.
