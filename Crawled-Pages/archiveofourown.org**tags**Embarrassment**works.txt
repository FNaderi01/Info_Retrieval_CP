    Summary
      The Complete Cases Of Sherlock Holmes And John Watson. All 366 cases plus assorted interludes, hiatuses, codas &amp;c. 
1900-1901. Into a new century but the adventures still continue for the dynamic duo. There are dead schoolboys, a dying clubman, an elephant with no legs, a dirt-digging journalist, a disgusting lizard (no, not Mr. Randall Holmes this time), a dodgy wager, a doomed landowner, a devious beneficiary and a dissimulating female. Things are much as normal then – but a surprise is lurking for one of the dynamic duo and it will involve a vampire of all things.

    Summary
      "Shouta knew it started with Hizashi. About a year after they started dating Shouta had noticed Hizashi was more and more tired with the pressure of all three of his jobs. So he woke up early, a difficult feat on its own, and went across town to buy Hizashi's favorite coffee. It was overpriced and tasted horrible in Shouta's opinion but Hizashi loved it. Hizashi was flustered and rushing around the apartment when Shouta opened the door. Shouta was holding a single large cup of coffee, warming his chilled hands. "Aizawa discovers his love language is gift giving and figures out how to show his affection to his husband, Student, *cough* son*cough*, and close friend.

    Graphic Depictions Of Violence Rape/Non-ConDuff McKagan/Izzy StradlinDuff McKagan Izzy Stradlin Axl Rose Slash | Saul HudsonAlternate Universe Alternate Universe - Science Fiction Slavery Lots of Sex Communication Failure violence (mainly past) they are all idiots Consent Issues lots of consent issues prejudices Stockholm Syndrome really really bad sex be prepared to feel lots of second hand embarrassment while reading this
    Summary
      Izzy is content with his life. He has his ship, his crew, his business of running cargo between planets, and there is enough empty space in the galaxy to stay away from civilization most of the time. No need to change anything. But one moment of getting carried away is as enough and his life suddenly takes a totally new direction. When after a job done well, he stumbles across a slave he really doesn’t need (young, pretty, sexual offender) a simple impulse buy is shaking up his whole existence. As a class zero citizen, Duff was used to life being shit, even before he got into conflict with the law and found himself suddenly facing a lifetime of servitude. Therefore, trying to make the best out of this newest complication comes naturally to him. However, his new master his really not making things easy because somehow, he did not read his ‘how-to-treat-your-slave’ manual. Will Izzy ever see the errors of his ways? Will Duff realize that he’s suffering from a severe case of Stockholm syndrome? Will Axl finally find a friend? And why does Slash’s track record with women suck the way it does?

    Summary
      Мэтт становится свидетелем величайшей трагедии современности.
  Широ смотрит на паренька, приоткрыв рот, и на его лице ни следа веселья. 
  — Паркур? — спрашивает Широ, как-то ухитрившись придать голосу заинтересованность.— Ага. — Паренёк убирает чёлку с глаз, само изящество. — Паркур.
    ***
  Кэти. Малый паркура в жизни не видел. Он бы не опознал паркур, даже если бы тот сделал обратное сальто с высотки и применил на нём бросок с прогибом в тёмном переулке.

    Summary
      A collection of short flash fiction requested through my tumblr. I'm going to do a flash fiction day at least once every month, and keep all the results here organized by date! If you wanna join in on next month's fun, come follow me on Twitter!Please keep in mind that these stories are extremely varied in kink, tone, and pairings. Some of them are romantic, some of them are hardcore and rough, and one of them literally has a naked Commander Shepard spreading dank memes. So...they're truly a bit of dirty chaos. I've decided to make a separate chapter for each, and the summary is a copy/paste of the actual prompt request that led to me writing it. Since all the chapter titles start with the franchise it's set in, should be easy to navigate to the smut you want!

    Summary
      Negan allowed his smile to stretch wider, if that was even possible. "Anything?" Negan asked, tilting his head slightly to the side, already knowing the answer.Rick would've nodded if the sharp metal wasn't pressed so insistently against his skin, so instead, he let out a breathy, "yes."Negan’s eyebrows jumped, when he couldn’t contain his excitement. His smile, two rows of white teeth, seemed to shine in condescension, as he spoke “Alright then!”. Pulling his bat away from Rick’s face, Negan placed Lucille on his shoulder once again. “If that’s the case, then I’m sure you wouldn’t mind too much marrying me.”----------------------------------------------In a world where Shane didn't show his true colors, or his true feelings, until after Negan's proposal. Basically, Negan protects Rick from Shane, and well you know what comes after.

    Summary
      “I felt like I was betraying A-Yao when I realized how badly I wanted to touch you myself. I do think you’re very attractive, Mingjue-ge, and…”
He hates Meng Yao. He hates him so deeply that it could choke and kill him if it ever learned how to be anything more physical than a burn in his blood. He hates Meng Yao for manipulating them both like this. 
He hates himself for going along with it. He doesn’t trust Meng Yao — he knows better — and yet.
And yet.
“I’d like you in my bed with me, if only once,” Lan Xichen finishes.
(At Meng Yao's suggestion, Nie Mingjue sleeps with his best friend.)
