STEG Annual Conference 2021
13 - 15 January 2021 / Online /

The research programme on Structural Transformation and Economic Growth (STEG), led by the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), will hold its first annual conference on 13-15 January 2021. This conference will fall near the close of STEG’s first (inception) year. The conference papers will help define the current research frontiers in the area of structural transformation and economic growth. STEG seeks to advance these frontiers over the next four years, through a programme of competitive research funding and academic community building. We expect the first funding calls to be issued in Spring 2021.
The conference will be hosted online via Zoom. We now invite submissions for this conference from interested researchers on any topic relevant to STEG’s major themes:
This list of themes is not intended to be exhaustive; other topics of potential interest include infrastructure, informality, and the implications of different macro policy frameworks for structural change and growth. We particularly welcome papers that address these themes in conjunction with our two cross-cutting themes, which are gender and climate change. STEG’s objective is to build a body of research and evidence that will inform policy in low-income countries; we consequently seek papers that have clear relevance to this goal. In addition to full-length presentations, the conference will include one or more (virtual) sessions of short presentations, as a way to highlight the diversity of research in the field and to offer more opportunities for early-career researchers and scholars representing a wide range of institutions and geographies. The deadline for submission is Wednesday 2nd December 2020. We will accept only completed papers. To submit a paper, please go to: https://portal.cepr.org/steg-annual-conference-2021. If you have any difficulties registering for this conference, please contact Mandy Chan, Senior Events Officer at [email protected].
