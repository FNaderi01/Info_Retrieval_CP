Yuletide tagset, yay!Oct. 10th, 2020 06:09 pm
trobadoraThe Yuletide tagset is up! So many excellent fandoms. :DOne character is missing from one of my planned requests, but I put in a comment at the comm, and hopefully it'll be remedied quickly. Already fixed, yay!I posted a list of Guardian-related fandoms over at sid_guardian - I'm very excited to see so many, and I'm really looking forward to seeing what people request, especially for the commercials, for Detective L and for TLTR/Chongqi. And Luo Fusheng, and Lian Chengbi, and ...! (The Daomu Biji books are also in, btw. Huh, I thought Liu Sang was a drama-only character? Shows what I know!)On the Sherlockiana front, there's also quite a bit! Study in Emerald, Enola Holmes, Miss Sherlock, Lady Sherlock, Exit Sherlock Holmes, Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century ...There's also Winnetou, and The Pretender, and the '80s She-Ra cartoon, and the Coldfire Trilogy, and so many others. And someone not only nominated Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, but also included the Jabberwocky! I hope they request her. And a whole bunch of fairy tales and myths and historical fandoms.(Special shout-out to Zhuge Liang in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, whose disambiguation - "Rot3K" - I misread as "Rot13" while scrolling. Gave me a bit of a double-take. :p)It's a fantastic tagset, seriously. Now I just need to decide what I'm going to offer. My requests have been decided with about 95% certainty since last Yuletide, but offers are a different matter.

Pandemic hairOct. 10th, 2020 09:13 am
gossLawd. I woke up this morning and realised that my normally sedate hair style is rapidly advancing towards Year 1 Hermione levels of poofiness. LOL.This is what happens when I avoid the hairdresser for 5 months. /o\My ideal hair length is this one, so it's weird for me to deal with all this hair past my neck, after years of never needing a hair accessory to wrangle it. :bLike, I can't remember any time in the last DECADE when I've had to untangle a knot. Yesterday, I had to do it three times. o_O

trobadoraWhen I was fully working from home earlier this year, I ended up cooking much more than usual, and eating much better. After I had to go back to the office in June, this almost entirely went away - I very often have neither the energy nor the patience when I come home. I want to change that again, but the energy-and-patience issue still applies. So: Anyone have a favourite quick-and-easy recipe to share?ETA: Thanks for all the general suggestions! ♥ But I'm mainly looking for specific recipes to try.

starandreaIt's the beginning of autumn!  All those houseplants I put outside over the summer to revitalize and enjoy the summer shade and rain need to come in before it starts freezing overnight!  Do I still have space for them inside?  Ha ha, define space!  No worries; I have plenty of time.Me at noon: Another nice sunny day!  I'm glad I left the plants out a little longer!  This is it, though.  Definitely gonna frost tonight.  Self, remember to clear some space for them and get them in before you go to bed.Me at 2am: oh shoot the plantsAnd the next day I wake up to the aftermath of Operation: Bring In The Plants In Complete Darkness And Put Them Anywhere.

A Productive Day OffOct. 9th, 2020 11:42 am
hilsI actually had a pretty productive day off yesterday considering how tired I was.The stream of The Untamed for my friend's birthday on Wednesday night was a lot of fun. I'd forgotten how damn beautiful that show is. Within 5 minutes of the first episode I had tears in my eyes just over how stunning the whole production is. The Untamed was the first cdrama I ever watched and although other shows have captured my heart since (looking at you, Guardian) there's no denying that The Untamed is special both for me personally and overall in terms of production value and quality. Before I went grocery shopping yesterday I was chatting with my friend Sarah on WhatsApp about Love and Redemption because it is definitely the sort of show she would enjoy. The topic turned to writing and she was saying she was struggling to get to the end of her current Untamed work in progress. I explained that I finished one nearly 2 months ago and was struggling to get it edited. We decided to have a writing/editing sprint to see if that would motivate us and it actually worked! I'm over halfway through editing my fic now and she managed to connect the two existing scenes she had so we both made progress. We're going to do it again this afternoon which, if I carry on the way I did yesterday, means I might actually get finished. Then I just need to find a beta. I also managed to watch a few more episodes of Love and Redemption which continues to be delightful. We're started moving from adorable romantic fluff to slightly more tragic territory now but it's that sort of dramatic tragedy born of misunderstandings rather than actual feels like you've been kicked in the chest tragedy. Still, I've only got to the end of episode 8 so there's still another 51 episodes for it to turn things up a notch. Last night was movie night and we watched Adventures of Power which is a movie about air drumming. I wasn't really sure what to expect, but it's actually a really sweet movie about how you don't need to be able to play an instrument to love music.Not much on the agenda today so the plan is to watch more Love and Redemption until it's time for the next writing/editing sprint with Sarah. Then I've got the weekly Zoom call with the Newcastle gang this evening which should be fun. I might have a look at getting some new games for us to play. Oh, and in K-Pop news NCT has dropped a new song and I love it! It's got an early 90s/Beastie Boys type feel to it and it's great. I'm kind of avoiding the k-pop fandom as there seems to be a lot of drama  and people with very strong opinions about whether it's acceptable to like more than one group or not. There are several groups I like but I think if I had to choose one it would be NCT and all their sub-groups. They seem to be consistently producing music that I really love. Watch on YouTube

Alas, Season 3Oct. 9th, 2020 12:14 am
bemused_writerThe fact that Dirk Gently isn't getting a third season is such a crime, so obviously the only solution is to slowly plan a massive fanfic for what a season three could have been. Thankfully, lots of plot points were hinted at, so there's something to work with there. This will not be posted for ages, but I just need that third season one way or another. D8Also, realizing the name of the series is too long to fit in with my "series: x" format, so that's a dilemma. XD

Get to Know You Ask MemeOct. 8th, 2020 09:45 pm
bemused_writerthiective asked: 1. How do you normally take tea/coffee?Tea has a bit more variety for me than coffee, so I’ll start there. If it’s an herbal tea I’m taking to get ready for bed or calm down, I’m not going to add anything to it except maybe a little milk. Possibly honey. On the other hand, if we’re talking black tea or any variety on that, it’s getting a touch of creamer and sugar.Coffee is where I go to town. XD It’s getting enough flavored creamer to be brown instead of black and then some sugar or honey to boot.Either tea or coffee--although usually coffee--will get some spices added as well, such as cinnamon or clove.Either way, I prefer the tea and coffee to be steeped/strong in flavor.Thanks for sending this in!

Drawtober Day 8 - ForestOct. 8th, 2020 11:47 pm
gossTitle: Day 8 - ForestArtist: gossRating: GFandom: n/aContent Notes: Created for Day 8 of drawesome's Drawtober 2020 Challenge. The prompt was Forest, and I decided to try this ink blowing thing, because it looked fun to do. I used a tiny amount of yellow and green ink, and a bendy straw. It came out mostly abstract, but it's still got that forest vibe. Pretty neat. ^__^Preview:( Click here for entire drawing )And because runpunkrun mentioned friendly bramble vs. dark and spooky, here are the photoshopped 'Nightime' versions. I love how it goes from sunshine to creepy with just a colour change. *g*( The Forest After Dark O_O )

"red eyes shining in the camera flash" / "now it's too late to turn back"Oct. 8th, 2020 09:30 pm
starandreaStar: Want to hear my new favorite song?Marci: Yeah, definitely.Star: Disclaimer, it's Christian rock, and it's called "Rattle."  As in "dry bones rattling."  But it's not as bad as that makes it sound.Marci: I feel like I'm reading AO3 tags on a fic that's like, all these terrible things, but "not as bad as the tags make it sound."Star: This is a true 2020 experience: zoom cooking and zoom yoga at the same time.Marci: Yeah, we're ignoring multiple zoom meetings simultaneously.  That's peak 2020.My workplace offers zoom yoga on Thursday afternoons.  My sister's workplace offered a cooking class today on how to make dumplings.  At the same time.  So we set up both our computers and logged into separate zoom sessions and talked about NaNoWriMo and Guardian | 镇魂 and Star Trek and Mo Dao Zu Shi | 魔道祖师 and The Untamed | 陈情令 while not completely failing to fold dumpling wrappers around delicious filling.  (I did fail to do yoga, but I support zoom yoga so I wanted my attendance to be recorded.)Star: Since my NaNoWriMo novel is going to be about the attack on Lotus Pier, I thought maybe I should watch it in the drama, but then I thought I should really just re-watch it in the anime, since that's where they have magical defenses and an actual strategy.  The drama is much less dramatic.Marci: Ironically.Star: Yes.I mentioned two music videos by different, super talented artists, that I think exemplify the difference between the drama and the anime.  They're both amazing, and you can see a lot of the same symbolism in both of them.  A live action story just naturally looks different than an animated one, because of the medium.(Content note: both videos include "canon-typical violence."  People are run through with swords; there's blood and fire and death.  I enjoy both of them, but they're not gentle or comforting.  They end on a positive note.)♥ The Phoenix &amp; the Ash [VID], vid by Aria (drama!Wei Wuxian)"he finds a way to rise somehow"♥ MDZS AMV - Blasphemy, vid by Nate (anime!Wei Wuxian)"bend your knee and give away your life"I didn't make her watch these videos, by the way!  We watched the cold springs/fluffy bunnies scene instead, first in the drama and then in the anime.  Anime advantage: they don't wear all their clothes into the cold springsDrama advantage: they get married!Based on this alone, I think we can safely say that glowing-headband bunnies have one up on rescued-by-resentful-energy bunnies.

Guardian mini-meta: do Haixing scientists know about Dixingren?Oct. 8th, 2020 08:12 pm
trobadoraI've been meaning to post more, get back into the habit, so here's a bit of meta/speculation from a recent email conversation.china_shop pointed out the following conversation between Shen Wei and Professor Ouyang (start of episode 22, outside the miracle doctor's place):Shen Wei: Professor Ouyang, is this Dr Feng as skilled as the rumors say?Prof. Ouyang: Yes. It's extraordinary. I've had bad knees for years, and he healed them in a heartbeat.Shen Wei: So how did he treat them?Prof. Ouyang: That's what I find so interesting. I didn't see him use any advanced medical technology, but the effects were amazingly immediate. This kind of ability is perhaps beyond the scope of humans.Shen Wei: You mean he's from Dixing?Prof. Ouyang: That would be for you to verify.**) That's "you" plural, 你们, btw. Presumably Ouyang means the SID - they talk about Shen Wei joining the SID before this bit of conversation, at the end of episode 21.china_shop asked:"Does that imply that Ouyang knows Shen Wei is Dixingren? (If so, Professor Zhou must too, right?) Or is it just harking back to Shen Wei's lecture at the start of the show, about whether mutants exist? Surely if Dixingren are spoken of openly in scientific circles, Lin Jing would know that --&gt; ZYL would know --&gt; ZYL wouldn't have been so surprised at Shen Wei mentioning them when they first met?"(quoted with permission)And I think this is a really fascinating question about Haixing scientific circles!I don't think Dixingren are spoken of openly in scientific circles - if that were the case, Zhao Yunlan would definitely be aware. And I don't think Professor Ouyang has the slightest clue that Shen Wei is Dixingren. He knows Shen Wei knows about Dixingren, he knows Shen Wei is doing related research, and he knows Shen Wei is working with the SID.Shen Wei himself is at no point surprised that Professor Ouyang is aware of Dixingren, not even in that scene in episode 1 where Ouyang tries to recruit Shen Wei for the Ministry lab. And Professor Ouyang, when he tells Shen Wei "your supposed genetic mutations have already appeared in reality", doesn't seem to expect Shen Wei to be shocked either. It looks to me like they clearly both know what they're talking about, and they're talking around the subject without mentioning it openly because they're in public. Professor Ouyang doesn't even get as direct as he does until after Li Qian has been sent away. So I do think Dixingren are spoken of in scientific circles - not openly, but behind closed doors. The scientists can't admit it openly or mention it in their published papers, but they're still talking about it to each other. And Lin Jing is aware of that, but can't tell Zhao Yunlan because then he'd have to admit he has connections in those circles, which he can't/won't, since he's a spy.What do you think - how much do Haixing scientists know about Dixing? (Now I wonder: was there a time where Professor Zhou explained Dixingren to Shen Wei? And did Shen Wei then troll him by earnestly asking questions Professor Zhou had no way of answering? :D)

Watching the MoonOct. 8th, 2020 10:24 am
forestofgloryMy kid's remote kindergarten class is doing a unit on the moon. All of us adults think this is great. As part of the unit we are supposed to go look at the moon every night. So, I have learned that its very hard to see the moon from our house most nights. I was vaguely aware that I didn't see the moon very often, but looking for it nightly has made it very clear how hard it is to see the moon. We live in a bit of a canyon with lots of trees around so there's just not a lot of clear sky. For a bit we could see the moon if we walked down the street a bit to a clearer spot but now its rising latter and it doesn't get visible before bedtime. (We also had to skip a few days due to smoke)The moon unit is timed around the mid-autumn festival, which was last Thursday. We had a little family celebration. After dinner we went for a drive to try and see the full moon. However it was either to early or too smokey because we couldn't find it. So that was disappointing. After failing to find the moon we came home and had an indoor picnic sitting on a blanket on the floor. R had been to the Chinese bakery earlier that week and brought home six mooncakes each a different flavor. So we had one of those, lotus paste with salted egg because that was the most traditional, and some chocolate. Then we put the kid to bed. Did any of you observe the min-autumn festival? What did you do?

#ITPE 2020 Dear Podficcer Letter!Oct. 8th, 2020 10:08 am
aethelDear Podficcer,This year my main fandom is The Untamed/MDZS. All adaptations welcome, though so far I have only consumed the show and the manhua. I have osmosed book canon through fic, but do plan to read the novel at some point. I ship Lan Wangji/Wei Wuxian, Jiang Cheng/Nie Huaisang, and various junior combinations (in particular Jin Ling/Lan Sizhui as well as OT4). Nie Huaisang/Nie Mingjue can also be good. I also love Wen Ning and Wen Qing, but don't particularly ship them with anyone. (I don't *not* ship them.)My other fandom of the moment is Untamed RPF, Wang Yibo/Xiao Zhan. I am open to other ships, but haven't seen a lot.Other fandoms I like: Bandom (MCR, FOB), Discworld, Sherlock Holmes (Conan Doyle stories, Granada, RDJ films), TorchwoodBandom pairings I like: Frank/Gerard, Pete/Mikey, Pete/Patrick, Gerard Way/Lindsey Way. My Torchwood OTP is Jack/Ianto. Also Jack/Original Jack, but nobody writes it. It's so sad that there were only two seasons of Torchwood....Sherlock Holmes: I ship Holmes/Watson.Discworld: I haven't actually read that much fic, but I love the City Watch and witch characters. Things in fic I like include happy endings, humor, (mutual) pining, AUs (including, but not limited to: robots, space, supernatural, historical, rule 63 femslash), canon-compliant, genderfuckery, and fusions. Things I don't like include major character death (unless they're resurrected, of course), hockey, on-screen noncon, (non-consensual) infidelity, and other unhappy endings. I'm also not wild about PWPs as podfics, although that's mainly a practical matter of when/where I can listen.Things in podfic I like include music, effects, no effects, no music, you reading me a story! Thank you!!I have a lot of pinboard bookmarks and some AO3 bookmarks if you want ideas...Love,aethelP.S. I totally forgot I also love the Murderbot series until 5 minutes after I signed up.

Drawtober Day 7 - AlchemyOct. 8th, 2020 12:32 am
gossBoo. Back to post-midnight drawing. :b But I am delighted to be drawing Roy Mustang. Also, I went googling his glove design and came upon this sculpt, which is AMAZING. LOOK AT the folds in his white shirt. *___*Title: Day 7 - AlchemyArtist: gossRating: GFandom: Fullmetal AlchemistContent Notes: Created for Day 7 of drawesome's Drawtober 2020 Challenge. The prompt was Alchemy, and my mind immediately went to the Flame Alchemist himself, Roy Mustang. *g*Even though it would have been a lot simpler to recreate these particular textures using watered down ink and a paintbrush, I wanted to challenge myself to try capturing smoke and flame with hard lines using a fineliner pen.  Not 100% successful, but I had fun letting loose with all those scribbly lines, and did find the result kinda cool. :)Preview:( Click here for entire drawing (and WiP photos) )

DBH Story ProgressOct. 7th, 2020 05:01 pm
bemused_writerI have decided for my DBH fanfic the matter of the utmost importance is Hank revealing himself for the millennial he is. Most likely this will be through conversations about music with Connor and possibly TV show preferences...? He's a technophobe, so a bit of an odd millennial, but those exist. This can work.As for the story more generally, the writing is going decently. The first chapter is from Connor's perspective and there's a lot of groundwork that needs to be established, such as how things are going for androids, what their new case is, how things are going between Hank and Connor more generally, etc. etc., before I can jump straight into the investigative part of the story. Maybe a 5k first chapter?Also, I definitely need to make some kind of progress on that Young Justice story I promised. Oh, boy...
