Words of the Week – Turn the Other Cheek            
				By Joshua Apparicio, Contributing Youth Writer                
	                	                Published March 20, 2019

To the youth readers, my prayer is that you all have been enjoying the Words of the Week I’ve been sharing with you. Writing to the youth throughout many communities has certainly been therapeutic for me.
Being able to have this opportunity to speak directly and concisely to the youth is something I wouldn’t have even begun to envision, say, six years ago.
It states in Matthew 5:38, “You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’” As Christians, we don’t always find a solution in using one insult to describe another person. This is the godly way.
        ADVERTISEMENT        
I remember being punched in my temple so hard that I had migraines for months. I do believe God gave me the strength to turn the other cheek. Reliving unpleasant situations in order to connect with you all using the word of God is sometimes difficult; but it works because I’m no longer in that place of hurt.
So I can comfortably share about turning the other cheek and applying Matthew 5:39, “But I tell you not to resist an evil person. But, whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.”  I know this may seem perplexing and pointless, but it’ll make sense in time. You will not have to apply anger, but rather you can apply forgiveness to the situation.
I have fond memories of my mother reading to me when I was very young as part of our routine. She explained that what she was reading to me and we had discussions afterwards.  The most striking Bible story, which I love, was the crucifying of my Lord Jesus Christ on the cross. Imagine nails piercing your hands, and your feet being nailed together, as well as a crown of thorns pressed against your head.  Instead of Jesus turning the other cheek, He asked the Father to forgive them for they know not what they do.
The Word of God exhorts us not to retaliate in Proverbs 24:29, “Say not. I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.” We cannot focus too much on literally turning the other cheek, but must take sensible charge of our actions.
As Christians, we rely on the Word of God for instruction. Paul speaks of a sort of transcendental mentality in Romans 12:2, “Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of our minds.”
My understanding as it relates to turning the other cheek reminds us in Isaiah 55:8, “My thoughts are not your thoughts, My ways are not your ways.” 
As I continue my spiritual journey, I consistently remain respectful and humble, because God will verily reward me, as he will you.
Amen!
