    Summary
      Traveling around the world for seven years and helping solve world famous homicides? Easy. Summoning ghosts and communicating the circumstances of their deaths to the living world? Piece of cake. Spending eight days with his siblings? Absolutely impossible. Or, Klaus, a medium homicide detective, comes home to investigate the death of his father. He ends up having to deal with so much more than that.
