    Summary
      They say you must enjoy your last year of high school, but this is Korea, where fun means late-night study cramps so you can achieve minimum terms to apply for any college available.Fun also means when Eduan needs to pretend-date Jahad so he can prove not-so-little innocent Aguero that he's a great model example of a brother.Includes: Siblings blackmailing each other, the school's golden couple, death threats from Enryu, V literally kicking everyone's asses and finding out how cute Jahad is when he smiles. (The last part, maybe he noticed it since they first met 5 years ago. Maybe not.)
