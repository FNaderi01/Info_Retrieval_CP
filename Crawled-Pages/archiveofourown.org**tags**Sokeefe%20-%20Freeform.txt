      Things are going great with Fitz. No really, they are! Sophie's mind has finally stopped spazzing out about the boy with the teal eyes now that they’ve shared their first kiss. Her brain can finally be at peace.Except...Except why did she feel so miserable all the time? There was this horrible aching in her chest. This constant pressure pushing against her. She was sick! That had to be the answer. Of all the elves in the Lost Cities, she would be the one idiot who somehow ended up with a cold.Searching for answers, Sophie stumbles upon a book that can give her the exact answers she needs. Even if they weren't the answers she'd been expecting.

    Summary
      Her heart was beating so fast now it felt like her chest was being squeezed. Her lungs weren’t expanding like they should. She yanked on the chains wrapped around the handles of the front door. Pulled them with all her might. “Let me out!”A voice in the back of her head told her to calm down before she made this worse. Everything was fine. So she was stuck alone in a library, but she was safe. She could read and jog the stairs and stay busy. There were plenty of distractions here.In her new quiet state, She heard something behind her. Footsteps on wood.Sophie whirled around, pressing her back to the door. That’s when she saw a shadowy figure on the stairs, a metal object glinting in his right hand. A knife. She wasn’t alone after all. And she definitely wasn’t safe. {DISCONTINUED}Sophie Foster is trapped in a library. With no way to escape. Alone. she doesn’t think things could get any worse. But that’s before she realizes that Keefe Sencen is locked in with her.

    Summary
      He tapped his pencil against his cheek and glanced up. A little black cat figurine sat in a tree.Who would put that out here? And why in a tree?He took his earbuds out and stepped toward it, confused enough to investigate.Leaves crunched under his feet. “Mrrrw?”Keefe jumped back, watching as the little kitten, who was not, in fact, a figurine, trembled on the branch.“Mrrrrw,” the kitten cried, shaking.Keefe’s heart softened, and he jogged toward it, keeping his eyes on the kitten.“Hey! Watch where you’re going!” A girl suddenly stood in front of him, her arms crossed. Her long blonde hair swayed in the wind; her brown eyes narrowed.
