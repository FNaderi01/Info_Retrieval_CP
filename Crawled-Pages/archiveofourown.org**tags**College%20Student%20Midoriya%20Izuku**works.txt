    Summary
      It's October and you know what that means. Everyday a new chapter. Mostly Bakugou and Deku related stuff. But, since I'm a Multishipper and no one can tell me otherwise it will contain a lot of other ships. Even some rare pairs. Oh and it won't always be NSFW. I promise.

    Summary
      'The rules are simple. Battle of the Bands. Local bands send in a single track to the radio station, and ten tracks are selected. Over the coming month, the songs play on the station and listeners vote on the top five. The top 5 play a live concert as part of a music festival, then the top 3 at a larger, indoor venue. The top two have the honor of opening on the first stop of All Might’s retirement tour – here. In Izuku’s home town. And finally, the winner gets the ultimate prize. Getting to spend the rest of the tour, forty cities, across the country as All Might’s opener. Three months. Same tour bus. Shoulder to shoulder with the greatest musicians the world has ever known.'Izuku Midoriya is a broke college student presented with the opportunity of a lifetime. But winning isn't gonna be easy, especially when one band's aggressive blonde frontman seems to be dead-set on making Izuku's life a living hell.

    Summary
      “B-Bye” Izuku says in such a low voice that even he could barely hear himself, so he doubts the Alpha heard him. Much to his surprise, he watches the Alpha freeze for just a moment and look over his shoulder at him. Izuku feels his breath hitch for just a second before slowly breathing out again as he watches the other look forward again and walk right out the store.
‘What was that?’ Izuku asks himself as he clutches his beating heart. 
OR 
College student Izuku Midoriya works the night shift at a small convenience store by himself. Despite the constant dangers of being a male Omega he pushes though each night until a mysterious (and gorgeous looking) Alpha visits the store before closing time. He resists the urge to submit to this Alphas sweet caramel scent. 
But what happens when this same Alpha comes back every single night? And eventually begins to walk him home each night?This was only supposed to be a onetime meet between a cashier and customer right? 
This is my first published work!
