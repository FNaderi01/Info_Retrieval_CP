    Summary
      Obito knows bone deep that he will never quite be the same again after living captive under the influence of Uchiha Madara, can feel the change under his skin were green things writhe. Kakashi's differences extend past his new found sense of humor, live in the complete disregard for others opinions. The change in Rin is subtler, something brewing under her quiet composure that he can't quite see the shape of yet.
