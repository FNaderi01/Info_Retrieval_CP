i can’t believe luke showed up to fight his nephew via astral force projection in custom gucci threads and chanel boots. hair all sleek, with organic beard oil, smelling like yves saint laurent l'homme and his skin all exfoliated. we truly stan a fashion icon.

I rewatched The Phantom Menace (I know) for the first time since 1999 last night, and I am absolutely OBSESSED with Qui-Gon Jinn’s desert poncho outfit:Qui-Gon may have crash landed on Tatooine, but the desert heat isn’t going to stop him from love laugh living his best life and ordering some pumpkin spice space juice from the local cantina. Dress for the emergency evacuation from Naboo that you want, not the one you have!And is he wearing… the Chanel boots? Yeah, he is.
