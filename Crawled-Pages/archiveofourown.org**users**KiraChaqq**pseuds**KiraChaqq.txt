    Summary
      Vor 15 Jahren verschwand Katsuki Hiroko mit der gesamten Besatzung der USCSS Nostromo vom Angesicht des Universums.Sie hinterließ eine gebrochene Familie, die schon immer um das tägliche Überleben auf dem Urlaubs-Trabanten Yutopia kämpfen musste.
Katsuki Yuuri hat das Verschwinden seiner Mutter nie überwunden. Geplagt von Schuldgefühlen und Selbstzweifeln wagt er einen Neuanfang: als Androiden-Ingenieur auf der Sevastopol Station. 
"Im Hintergrund erwachten die Luftfilter und grün blinkenden Monitore zum Leben. Jedes neu erklingende Geräusch erweckte den Anschein von Leben und Aktivität, aber in Wahrheit war es nur ein Mechanismus um das Gefühl absoluter Isolation, welches Menschen in dieser Umgebung befallen konnte, abzumildern."
"Mittlerweile war der Schmerz zu einem treuen Begleiter geworden, ein Schatten, der sich niemals abschütteln ließ und sich in all seine Entscheidungen einbrannte. Wie oft hatte er schlecht bezahlte Aufträge angenommen, um nebenher den Quadranten abzusuchen, in dem die USCSS Nostromo verschwunden war? Wie oft hatte er seinen Vater und seine Schwester auf der Suche nach seiner Mutter zurückgelassen?"
Shortly, there will be an english translation available!

    Summary
      The world was blurry and gray. The air smelled slightly stale and yet every new breath was sweet as sugar. In the background, the air-filters and green-flashing monitors came to life. Each new born sound gave the impression of life and activity, but in truth it was just a mechanism to prevent the emotional experiences of total isolation. A danger for every human being caged in a constricted space without any sort of escape.--------15 years ago, his mother had disappeared with the entire crew of the USCSS Nostromo from the face of the universe. For years, Yuuri had been crying at night until sleep freed him from his suffering. His self-reproaches had torn him apart for letting her go. ________Determined to leave his past behind Yuuri starts to work on Sevastopol station as an android engineer. His future seems to be hopeful and promising, but something starts to feel off as dark shadows start to follow him.There's no place to hide away. No Escape.In order to survive he has to face his own demons to prevent himself from falling into the never ending abyss. Will he succeed or be eaten alive?A Yuri on Ice/Alien Isolation AU.

    Summary
      1905. The end of the Russo-Japanese War brings a stalemate and a treaty, one that gives Prince Yuuri as a bride to the Grand Duke of Imperial Russia. Relocated to Russia, a bitterly cold, decadent palace, Yuuri struggles in a foreign court. Silently vowing to seize control of the Russian throne, he finds himself slowly falling for the handsome Grand Duke and the inhabitants of his new home. But in the backdrop of Imperial Russia lies the hunger for change and the seeds of a revolution.
