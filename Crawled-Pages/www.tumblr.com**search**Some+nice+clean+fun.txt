            Serendipity 1        RE-POST  EDITED by @curly-haired-disasterPairing : Dean X ReaderCharacters : Dean , Sam , Castiel and JackWarnings : slow burn guys…slow burn. Also, some fluff, humor,feels and angst. a/n : this was my first ever spn writing. It started as a one-shot and I couldn’t put it down to rest and kept writing and writing. Don’t know what else to write honestly….this is my firstborn and I love it, I hope you do too.summary: You were minding your own business at work, in your little town.Your world was small and uneventful, work, studying, gym,netflix, a devastating heartbreak, the need to travel, the craving of freedom, adventure…just something different. You just knew you needed more .Suddenly an American green eyed stranger walks in and, like someone heard your prayer ,your life won’t be the same.Masterlist: 
Serendipity1.“Really, I can close up by myself, you know.”“Yeah, right. Uh-huh,” you scoffed, rolling your eyes, “You’ll
finish tomorrow morning, let me help! I’m not tired and it’s not that late”. The first bit was a lie, the second one not so much. It was just
after 11pm, and the last customers had already left leaving nothing to do but
to close down and clean up the bar you worked at.“Alright, well at least let me fix us something to drink while
you finish with the tables,”  your co-worker sighed, shaking her head as she
turned towards the bar, “Gin right?”“Please and thank you!” You chirped.“…such a snob…” She muttered..“What was that?” “Nothing!”Clicking your tongue between your teeth, you gave her your best
enduring smile and winked, earning a snort as well as immediate regret.The night had been easy enough. Not too crowded, which was
normal for the late winter season even during the weekend in your little city. You
just loved it.Like every other place in Italy, your town was old. Like,
founded-by-Romans-old, full-of-history old. It featured a temple and even a
castle just to name a few timeless perks to its name. It had all those secret
little streets and in-between places and big town squares. You worked in one of
these holes in the wall that added to the town’s charm, one of the many bars
facing the old church.“So, how’s life?” your friend asks“Oh, you know…same old same old “you replied without taking
your eyes from the tabletop you were cleaning.“Still talking to that dude?”You took a sip of your drink, taking a moment to savor the
bitter and refreshing taste of the gin tonic against your tongue…“Nah, it got boring” Please drop it please drop it, please
drop it, you pleaded mentally“Meaning?”Damnit!“…well you know he just,” You paused turning towards her, “he
was always fishing for compliments and attention, and that put an end on any
sort of interest that I might have had.”She snickered in response, “Oh come on, that bad?”“Uugh, can’t fake interest, it just feels wrong.” your eyes
rolled, “Also he probably just wanted …ya know” you replied, vaguely
motioning in the air with your hands and suddenly shy.“Well duh! Oh well at least you didn’t sleep with him…you
didn’t right?” She said leering at you, but she already knew.“Of course not!” you swirled the straw in your glass, suddenly
finding the ice interesting.“Y/n!” You dodged the rag she threw in your direction, “You need
to blow up some steam, clean the bat-cavern, a nice ride toward the sunset, the
fun type of workout, the-…” she theatrically mimics.“Oh cut it out!” your voice had raised slightly as you scowled,
“I just don’t feel like it, ya know? I can’t have one-night stands. It’s just
not me…at all”“I know, I know,” your co-worker sighed, running a hand along
her forehead, “I’m not judging here. But babe…don’t you miss …?” She
started making some obscene gesture.“Well, yeah of course I do, but dude; I just have no energy
right now to give to someone else…again. At least not right now,” You said
swallowing the rest of your drink and setting it along with the other empties on the
bar, “Now come on, let’s shut down this shit “Closing the door behind you, you dangled the keys teasingly in
front of your colleague. The opening shift was hers tomorrow morning. Her face
pinched as she looked at them as if they were some disgusting insect.“I did this whole week so shut your face,” you chided, placing
the keys on her head. You said your goodnights and you started walking down the
street towards your car.“YOU BETTER WAKE UP!” you heard her shout to your receding
back, “TAKE SOME RISKS, FALL IN LOVE- IT’S AMAZING WHOO OOOH” her shouts echoes
along  the empty street as you turned, still walking while two middle
fingers raised to the sky.She laughs and waves you goodnight.The road to your car was quiet, and with it being Sunday, you had
managed to park right under the castle. That means instead of long-deserted
city streets, you had to tackle a lot of stairs instead. It being an old ass
town, there wasn’t a lot in the way of parking spots.Panting from the late night stairmaster workout, you collapsed
on the seat of your car. Starting it up, you connected your phone and
started to drive. You rolled down the window and lit a cigarette. It was a
horrible vice,  It didn’t
match your image at all, and that made you smirk. Out of nowhere, a chill run down your spine and your breath was
suddenly visible.“…the fuck it’s so cold all of the sudden?” You huffed, turning
your gaze to the heather controls for a moment. You passed right by a
flickering figure, not even seeing it.Somewhere in the middle of the USA. Keep reading

“Who’s ready for some nice, clean fun?”“Dude. There’s thirty kilos of cocaine on the kitchen table.”
