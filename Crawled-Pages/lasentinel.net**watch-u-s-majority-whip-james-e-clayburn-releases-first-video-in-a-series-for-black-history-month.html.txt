WATCH: U.S. Majority Whip James E. Clayburn Releases First Video In a Series for Black History Month            
				By Sentinel News Wire                
	                	                Published February 6, 2019
WASHINGTON, D.C. – The office of U.S. Majority Whip James E. Clyburn released the first in a series of videos called Lessons from History for Black History Month today. This video features Congressman Clyburn and Congressman Cedric Richmond discussing the lessons of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s.
The video series pairs seasoned Congressional Black Caucus members with younger members for a short exchange during which the members interviewed each other about lived experiences during the civil rights era and new experiences like being the first Black member from their state.
        ADVERTISEMENT        
“As a former history teacher, I believe it is important to learn lessons from our past,” Congressman Clyburn said. “These videos provide a small window into the experiences of CBC members who have all taken different paths to get to Congress, and now we find ourselves serving in the most diverse Congress in history. I hope this series serves as a history lesson for the next generation who may be aspiring to follow in our footsteps.”
Additional videos will be released each Friday in February by the participating offices.
The videos can be viewed on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.
