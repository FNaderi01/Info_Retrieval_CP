If it is important, the Chinese state has a stake in it,'' he said.Communications and Information Technology Minister Amy Adams told Radio New Zealand she was unable to make specific comments about security issues, "but what I can say is that we take the security of our network extremely seriously and that I'm very confident that we have robust processes in place''.Related articlesPoliticsClaire Trevett: Key discovers timing is everything28 Mar, 2012 04:30 PMQuick ReadNew Zealand|Politics Big brother may be watching you30 Mar, 2012 04:30 PMQuick ReadNew ZealandCartoon: Huawei broadband deal1 Apr, 2012 05:29 PMQuick ReadWorldChina crackdown over coup rumours1 Apr, 2012 05:30 PMQuick Read"Actually, (Huawei) is involved in a lot more rollouts than it's been excluded from. They are one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world so it would be unusual for them not to have some sort of involvement,'' she said.Prime Minister John Key said on Monday the UFB contract with Huawei began before Australia's action against the company, but he was "comfortable with the current arrangements'' in New Zealand.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Mr Key said issues about Huawei had been raised and considered.Huawei global head of cyber security John Suffolk told Radio New Zealand the idea that Huawei could use its UFB contracts to spy under everyone's noses was unrealistic."With these rollouts you do tend to find that it's more than one company involved so it's not just Huawei equipment - it's connecting to other people's equipment, so to say that you can snoop ... I think it's a hell of a lot more complicated than people think it is. That's a little bit James Bond-ey, to be honest.''Mr Suffolk said Huawei had nothing to hide."We only write and design commercial equipment used by commercial operators ... and we're quite happy to be put through the most rigorous audit or inspection anyone can dream of.''Mr Suffolk also questioned branding Huawei a "Chinese technology company''.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME."When you begin to look at what technology is, you don't have a north or an east or a west or a south, you have a global technology supply chain. You unpick your iPhone or your iPad and you will find many different suppliers' components in that technology.''The Labour Party's Communications and IT spokeswoman Clare Curran questioned why, if the Australians were concerned enough to ban Huawei from bidding for the broadband contract, had New Zealand allowed three taxpayer-funded contracts to go ahead without a more robust probe into the implications for the integrity of the network."How long have John Key and other ministers known about the extent of Australia's security concerns and what are they going to do about it? Just saying trust us, it'll be okay, isn't good enough,'' she said."Essentially our government is looking the other way and refusing to take a second look at the contracts that have been given to Huawei despite the intense public interest in this matter.''AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from TechnologyPremiumBusinessKiwi tech firm sends Aussie staff home after positive Covid-19 test11 Oct, 2020 06:56 PM4 minutes to readPremiumBusinessFive Eyes warning: 'Encryption creates severe risks to public safety'11 Oct, 2020 06:19 PM3 minutes to readBusinessFacial recognition deal throws access open11 Oct, 2020 06:12 PM7 minutes to readPremiumBusinessElectoral Commission trying to attract youth vote - is it working?11 Oct, 2020 04:00 AM3 minutes to readPremiumBusinessXero hits new high on analyst upgrade - why it could go higher9 Oct, 2020 04:47 AM3 minutes to readMost PopularSport|Rugby'I like seeing the disappointment': Fearless Dave Rennie's All Blacks message11 Oct, 2020 07:30 PM3 minutes to readLifestyleMum's warning after daughter loses leg in horrific home accident11 Oct, 2020 07:05 PM2 minutes to readMotorsportSpecial Scott McLaughlin Ford Mustang revealed as supercharged monster11 Oct, 2020 07:00 PMQuick ReadAdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Paid Promoted ContentAbout NZMEHelp &amp; SupportContact UsSubscribe to NZ HeraldManage Your Print SubscriptionNZ Herald E-EditionAdvertise with NZMEBook Your AdPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseCompetition Terms &amp; ConditionsSubscriptions Terms &amp; ConditionsÂ© Copyright 2020 NZME Publishing Limited
