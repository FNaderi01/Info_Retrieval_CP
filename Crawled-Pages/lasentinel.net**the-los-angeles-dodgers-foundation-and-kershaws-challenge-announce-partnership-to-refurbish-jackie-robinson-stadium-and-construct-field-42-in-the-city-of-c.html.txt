The Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation and Kershaw’s Challenge Announce Partnership to Refurbish ‘Jackie Robinson Stadium’ and Construct ‘Field 42’ in The City of Compton

The Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation (LADF) and Kershaw’s Challenge announced a partnership to refurbish Jackie Robinson Stadium and construct a new “Field 42” at Gonzales Park in the City of Compton. The project, which was unveiled earlier today during Jackie Robinson Day ceremonies at Dodger Stadium, will commemorate the 100th birthday of Jackie Robinson. Construction will begin later this year on Dodgers Dreamfields 52 and 53, which will continue LADF’s commitment to build 75 Dodgers Dreamfields by the 75th anniversary of the Dodgers’ move to Los Angeles in 2033.
“Jackie Robinson Day is always a special day in Los Angeles, and it’s hard to think of a better way to honor his legacy and celebrate his centennial birthday than by increasing access to youth baseball and softball in Compton,” said Nichol Whiteman, Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation CEO. “The Gonzales Park Dodgers Dreamfields, renovating Jackie Robinson Stadium and building ‘Field 42,’ are large-scale projects, and we couldn’t do it without the support of Clayton and Ellen Kershaw and Kershaw’s Challenge. We’re grateful to have such amazing partners for this project, and look forward to continued joint ventures in the future.”
This marks the third Dodgers Dreamfield location that Clayton and Ellen Kershaw have supported along with the universally accessible field at Baldwin Hills Recreation Center and the 50th Dreamfield at Algin Sutton Recreation Center. In addition to the commitment of Kershaw’s Challenge, Clayton Kershaw will help give a lucky fan the ultimate Dodgers gameday experience and raise funds for the project through a sweepstakes, which includes a game of catch with the left-hander, roundtrip airfare to Los Angeles and a four-star hotel accommodation, a pregame tour and batting practice experience, a Kershaw autographed baseball and two tickets in the Lexus Dugout Club. All proceeds from the sweepstakes will go towards the completion of the Gonzales Park Dodgers Dreamfields, and more details on how to win this once in a lifetime experience can be found at Dodgers.com/win.

“The Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation sets the bar high for exceptional service to our city. We are proud to consider them our close friends and co-laborers in finding unique ways to reach underserved children and families,” said Clayton and Ellen Kershaw. “The Dodgers Dreamfields program in particular aligns with our love for the game of baseball and our desire to see more kids engage in the opportunity. It is an honor to officially join hands with LADF as one of our 2019 Kershaw’s Challenge beneficiaries. We believe in their work and we love their team. This year, Kershaw’s Challenge will seek to lead the charge on two new Dreamfields in the Compton area. We look forward to providing funding and exposure to the great work of LADF through these new fields. As we have seen with Kershaw’s Challenge for the past 10 seasons, it takes a village of like-minded organizations to create lasting change. We are thrilled to make this change happen with our friends at the Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation.”

The renovation of Jackie Robinson Stadium will reenergize the site and create a welcoming environment through upgrades to the field, outfield fence, dugouts, scoreboard, backstop, lighting, bathrooms/locker room facilities and spectator viewing areas. The new “Field 42” will serve youth ages 5-12 and enhance the playing experience for baseball and softball players in the area with a new large LED scoreboard, windscreens on the outfield wall, an enclosed batting cage and a new irrigation and watering system to ensure that the field stays ready for play well into the future.
 The Gonzales Park Dodgers Dreamfields help fulfill the vision of Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities (RBI) founder the late John Young, as he strove to attract more youth to the sport of baseball/softball and create a state-of-the-art sports facility in the City of Compton. With a youth population of over 10,000 and a poverty level of 26.6 percent in the area, these fields will help increase park access and contribute positively to community outcomes. The site is expected to serve 360 youth this spring in the first season of Dodgers RBI at Gonzales Park this spring.
