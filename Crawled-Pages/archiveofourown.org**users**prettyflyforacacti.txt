    Summary
      Camping had been a good idea at the time. The fresh air, the lack of people, the scenery. Just you, Frisk, and the crisp fall weather. But hey, when had anything gone according to plan in your life before?In which the two of you fall into Mt. Ebott and your life gets even more complicated than it was as time goes on. But at least you can take everything in stride. Hopefully.Oh, and a crazy homicidal flower keeps trying to kill Frisk. That jerk.Entry One: Learning: 1 - 18Entry Two: Adapting: ??? - ??? Entry Three: Persevering: ??? - ???

    Summary
      Rex isn't over Fives' death, and turned his own grieving into a tide of anger that is making it dangerous to have him as a Captain. Fox knows Rex needs to let out his anger, and he feels like he needs to atone for what happened at that warehouse, where a clone trooper of name Fives was killed by Fox's own blaster fire.Both Rex and Fox need closure.
