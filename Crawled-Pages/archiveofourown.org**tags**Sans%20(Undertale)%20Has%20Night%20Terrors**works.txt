    Summary
      Frisk grew up in a home with neglectful, drug using parents. With a little sister to take care of, Frisk goes to Mt. Ebott to collect a flower specimen for a professor in town who was willing to pay three hundred dollars for it. When she falls into the Underground, she finds danger, but also family and friendship. With the help of a mysterious ghost girl named Chara who only she can see and who she shares a connection with, as well as some new friends, especially a certain pair of skeleton brothers, Frisk tries to get back home to her sister, but what will be the cost? And how far will Frisk go to protect both her sister and her new friends?

    Summary
      What if Undyne were to suddenly remember the RESETs? Well, not immediately, of course, but slowly, over the course of multiple RESETs.  She definitely wasn't going to keep quiet about it, and I'm personally basing this story of a what if that appeared in my head due to a random thought about how she has Determination, enough to let her not die/dust for a period of time, but not enough to bleed like Sans does (I head canon Sans to be bleeding Determination in dis -w-;) or remember RESETs. But what if she were to suddenly, slowly but surely, be able to remember the RESETs?

    Summary
      REWRITE OF "ALONG CAME A SPIDER" (2015)When 12 year old Tuffet is thrown out of her house due to some ridiculous Spider Tradition, she takes to living on her own without much fuss. But how will she handle her new, independent life when two shape shifters just kinda... take up her couch? She lets them in with open arms, but they seem hesitant. They're clearly hiding things, but living under one roof, some trust has to build... right?

    Summary
      The first thing Sans remembered was standing in Judgement hall. Then getting killed for the two hundredth time.  The next? Waking up in his room. With company. With Papyrus, his brother, who oddly enough really wasn’t his brother to be precise, and some weirdo look-alike twin of Frisk. It’s official. His life is fucked up.

    Summary
      Working at night at Wal-Mart can be tiring in the pay  is not so good. But it's quiet so you can't complain about it that much. Your life is boring and your history full pain. But a bunch of monsters come into your life and it's no longer boring. Especially when a tiny skeleton is always around the corner every where you went.

    Summary
      The reconciliation of monsters and humans is a slow process, but one that Frisk has very high hopes for. With Negotiations underway, and a future spreading out before them, she can only believe that their happy ending has finally played out to fruition. But when Sans, still haunted by the fear of the resets, takes matters into his own hands as a means of 'keeping his family safe', he unwittingly sends them all spiraling down toward a dangerous conclusion.When a happy ending is all at once a nightmare, Frisk and her family are faced with either saving one of their own, or saving the world as they know it. And saving both might not be an option.

    Summary
      With each death the darkness grows, consuming and twisting a lost soul that is torn from betrayal.Why does this seem so familiar? These dreams feel so real...Are they dreams or perhaps they are memories of another life? Another timeline?Two voices call out to the lost soul... One offers help, all they want is to be friends.The other, a weaken whisper that longs to be heard. Everyone lies, betrayal runs deep.Who to trust when both voices lie? Another soul tired but refuses to give up, for he knows what will happen if he does."i wasn't ready for this responsibility... but darling... you didn't give me much a choice..."He says as he raises his bony hand, a faint purple aura around it.

    Summary
      After reliving the same traumatic events over and over again, Frisk can see that Sans doesn't have much left to give. With each reset that steals away their happy ending, Chara is getting a little closer to breaking the monster completely. Sans is hanging on by a thread, and Frisk knows eventually that thread will snap. Filled with desperation and determination, Frisk does the only thing she can. She calls for help. The mages, her Den, that answer the call  may just be enough to save the underground. They may just be enough to save Sans from what he has endured for so long and remind him that someone out there cares a whole lot about him.

    Summary
      Something isn't right with the surface, but Sans has other problems to deal with. Frisk tries desperately to become his friend, but he evades every attempt. Underneath it all is the not-so-friendly humans. Rated teen and up due to swearing and suicide content.
