                Hi!  I used to be on LJ, but am now exclusively on Dreamwidth.  I quit LJ after 13 years for political reasons.  I'm a passionate 1D fan.  I post a lot about the group and about Harry, Liam, Louis, Nial and sometimes maybe even Zayn.  I'm also a huge fan of Game of Thrones.  So those are the two subjects I'll most likely post most about
