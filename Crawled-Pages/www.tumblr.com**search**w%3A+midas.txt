4greek mythology → tragedies
and did they not have everything?
these beautiful, tragic beings.
did they not have strength to move mountains,
gold enough to buy the heavens,
beauty to rival aphrodite and
freedom to soar amongst the clouds?
and yet not one could claim happiness.not one could show a true smile.

            [!] fic alert [!]        ↳ COMING SUNDAY, JUNE 28TH AT 10:30PM ESTsummary: jeon jungkook was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and the power to turn whatever he wants into pure gold. you were born with healing and invisibility powers but without a cent to your name. so when you’re plucked off of the streets for pickpocketing and assigned to be his minder as punishment, the two of you realize that you both have no choice but to spend time with each other.{enemies to lovers!au, ceo!au, magical realism!au}pairing: jeon jungkook x female readergenre: fluff, comedy, angstest. word count: 25k-30ka/n: hello and welcome back to your regularly scheduled e2l programming with me, guyi. you guys know i can’t resist tropes like this, and this one is basically every single thing i love rolled up into one. the est. word count is that big because i’m trying to overestimate rather than underestimate. but we’ll see!preview:“I don’t need a minder,” Jungkook repeats for the umpteenth time. “I don’t misuse my magic or abuse my powers.”“Uh,” you point out, an eyebrow raised skeptically, “I think I’d like to beg to differ.” There’s more gold in this room than miners probably found in San Francisco in the nineteenth century. “Please,” Jungkook says with a frown. “As if we don’t all use our powers for our own benefit. Huh? What did you do that was so terrible that you had to be assigned as my minder?”“I pickpocket,” you explain economically. No point in sugar-coating it. Jungkook has probably already figured out you don’t come from nearly as much money as he does. “And I got caught.”“Sucks,” Jungkook comments callously. “Sucks for you, too,” you fire back. “You got caught as well. Agree to the terms or go to jail, Jeon Jungkook. I don’t care. But don’t say I didn’t try to help.”You stand there in silence for a few more seconds, letting your words dissipate into the air, sinking into the ground. Jeon Jungkook seems to have this furious battle within himself, brows furrowing as he rubs at his chin, pacing back and forth behind his desk. He knows he doesn’t have a choice. He goes to jail and his reputation is soiled. The Realm repossesses all that he has made of himself and he must start from scratch under their ruthlessly watchful eye. There will be no recovery. Only survival. Or, he deals with you for a couple of months until the Realm is satisfied with the both of you, and you both go on your merry way, never having to see each other again. You know what you’d pick if you were in his shoes. “Fine,” Jungkook spits out, pointing an accusing finger your way. “But you are to be invisible whenever we are in public, and that includes here.”“Done. But you have to decrease your turning otherwise we’ll be stuck with each other forever,” you negotiate. “I’ll also have to come and live with you. Can you handle that, or are you too ashamed to have someone else inside your home?”Jungkook scoffs. “I live in a penthouse the size of a museum. Pick whatever bedroom you fucking want. I doubt we’ll even see each other.” At least there’s one upside to having to stay with him in his massive home.“Fine,” you spit out, just for good measure. “Fine,” he counters back. Like anything about this conversation, this agreement, this goddamn life you have to live, is fine. Yeah, right.

//So there is a Midas model in SFM now! I decided to grab photos of his tattoos for a friend but decided others might need them! For the other arm just literally flip the tattoos! And he has tattoos finished under the clothes but sadly it is hard to get a good angle on them! So I might try and sketch them out unless someone can get them through Blender. Which would be the easier options.
