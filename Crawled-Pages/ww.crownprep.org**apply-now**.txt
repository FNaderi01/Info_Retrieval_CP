			Admission Information
				Admission Requirements
CPA is an open enrollment, tuition-free public school with no specific requirements for admission (e.g., minimum grade point average, test scores, discipline records, etc.).  Enrollment to the Charter School shall be open to any resident of the State of California. CPA admits all pupils who wish to attend CPA to the extent that space allows. CA Ed. Code § 47605(d)(2)(A).  Parents are informed during the enrollment process that parent involvement/volunteer hours are not a requirement for admission or continued enrollment at the Charter School.
Following the open enrollment period each year, and after accounting for existing students who are guaranteed enrollment in the following school year, applications shall be counted to determine whether any grade level has received more applications than availability.  If the number of students applying for enrollment exceeds the Charter School’s capacity, admission shall be determined by random public drawing (lottery).
				Lottery Preferences and Procedures
CPA shall provide admission to matriculating students from 24th Street ES and students who reside in the 24th Street ES attendance boundary. The attendance boundary configuration shall be determined by LAUSD and is subject to change at the discretion of LAUSD. CPA shall remain a school of choice and parents may exercise their right to have their students attend a different school.
After all matriculating students from 24th Street ES and students who reside in the 24th Street ES attendance boundary have been admitted, CPA will determine if it has capacity to admit any additional students, based on enrollment capacity and plans contained in this petition. If more students from outside the 24th Street ES attendance boundaries seek admission than there are spots available, CPA will conduct a lottery to determine admission.   Students who are currently enrolled are exempted from the lottery. Admissions preference is given to residents of the District and siblings of students who are admitted or attend the Charter School.  No other preferences shall be given.
Lottery spaces are pulled in order of grade level by the Principal or designee. As names are pulled, students are assigned a number corresponding to the number of enrollment slots. Once a grade level is drawn to capacity, applications continue to be drawn for position on a wait list.  Students who are not granted admission for that school year remain on the waiting list until the end of the school year for which the lottery was conducted unless otherwise requested by the parent to be taken off. Students must reapply for the following year.
Within two weeks of the lottery, families are notified in writing by the Principal (or his/her designee) of their enrollment status (offered enrollment or placement on waiting list).  Each student offered a space in the admission year is required to complete an enrollment packet within two weeks of receiving the letter indicating that a spot is available for the student.  The Charter School holds a Pre-Enrollment  informational session after the lottery and before the registration date to supply additional information and to assist families in filling out forms.
				What's in the Enrollment Packet?
The enrollment packet is comprised of the following:
Completion of a student enrollment form
Proof of Immunizations
Home Language Survey
Completion of Emergency Medical Information Form
				Waitlist
The waiting list includes contact information of the families not admitted through the lottery who want to still be considered for admission should a position open.  If a position opens during the course of the year, the School Operations Manager contacts the family of the student on the top of the waiting list by phone or email to offer their student admission to the Charter School.  If a family is notified by phone or email  more than ten (10) days prior to the first day of school, the family has ten (10) days to confirm enrollment and return a completed enrollment packet. If a student is notified within ten (10) days of the start of the school year or after the school year has begun, they have 72 hours to confirm enrollment via phone call or email and submit an enrollment packet by mail or email to the Operations Manager.  Should the family decline the position, the next family on the list is contacted until the open position is filled.  The Charter School shall communicate these procedures to parents of students on the waiting list.
A copy of all enrollment forms, waiting lists, and lottery results are kept on file in the CPA administrative office and will be readily available for inspection by District representatives.
