Success On “The Way” Ask Dr. Jeanette: “Technology: The Monster ”            
				By Dr. Jeanette Grattan Parker                
	                	                Published September 14, 2018

Every industry trends toward digital transformation. The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a human race disaster according to some and Ted Kaczynski: ‘dubbed the unabomber,’ sent a series of mail bombs to university and airline officials; evaded the FBI for over 18 years; captured in 1996; a child prodigy entering Harvard University at 16, graduated, earned a doctorate in mathematics at 25; assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley, quit in two years, abandoned an academic career retreating in isolation 1969 to a small cabin primitive lifestyle in Lincoln, Montana.
Publishing his manifesto 1995, he sent a letter to The New York Times promising to “desist from terrorism” if The Times or The Washington Post published his essay, Industrial Society and Its Future, argued that his bombings were extreme, but necessary to attract attention to the erosion of human freedom and dignity by modern technologies. His crimes do not justify his killing and acts of terrorism. But, it’s difficult to ignore some of his predictions appear to be manifesting in the current world; writing “If the [technological] system breaks down the consequences will be very painful…the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner than later.” If it breaks down  the world will come  to a swift halt. 
Many predict it would be chaos, war, famine, disease and the fall of the human race.” It is possible that many of his predictions made within his personal manifesto are unfolding. Some point to vanishing privacy and harmful psychology. Continued development of technology will worsen the situation and may lead to greater social disruption. [Industrial Society and Its Future: The Unabomber Manifesto by Theodore J. Kaczynski: born 5/22/42 aka the Unabomber, Between 1978/1995, killed three people; injured 23; targeting people involved with modern technology. In 1998 a plea bargain was reached, pleading guilty to all charges and sentenced to life; no parole.  My question is: Was or is he really insane? Or setting off a prophetic warning of  irreversible destructiveness of  global technology and  the human race?
        ADVERTISEMENT        
He wrote in his manifesto about the breakdown of natural small-scale communities such as the extended family, the village or the tribe, ”all of which can be found in modern society. In fact, one cause for isolation is technology; separating humans from nature and from each other, creating isolation. In a 2014 article in The Daily Universe a study, “Most children and teens spend 75 percent of their waking lives with their eyes fixed on a screen,” if students unplugged their electronic devices for one 24-hour period felt extremely lonely.” People can reach the world in seconds: cellphone/internet, social media. Consider how lights can go out and effect a whole region and more.
