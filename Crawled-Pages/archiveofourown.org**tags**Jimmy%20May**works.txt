    Summary
      If you have found this story and not read the first installment or the second, please do so.  The existing plot points, characters and establishment of their lives will matter.  We are entering a time in Queen's history that contains many triumphs but will soon lead to a road of tragedy and loss.  The band is at the top of their game as they begin recording their next album.  But the strain of 10 years together is starting to show.  Creative tension and the need to keep up with the pace of a rock &amp; roll lifestyle will begin to create problems.  A new darkness is emerging in the world that will have an enormous impact on all their lives.  It will threaten everything that matters and cause each of them to react in ways they could never imagine.  Will the group survive all the turmoil?  Will Brian and Roger survive the stresses placed on their relationship?  And - what will be the final thing that makes Brian and Roger willing to reveal their most sacred secret to the world?  I hope you will join me for a dramatic journey through the 80's...one filled with love, laughter, tears, mistakes, forgiveness and remembering what matters most...friends will be friends...right til the end.

    Summary
      Louisa May has always been a great supporter of the career of her father and her uncles, even though she did not like the many consequences of their fame. So she tried to live a quiet life, but the idea of making Queen's story in a movie changed her plans, and without Louisa knowing, for Gwilym Lee, making that movie changed his plans as well. They both tried to avoid what was inevitable. (it takes place in the universe of Through Chrissie's Eyes).

    Summary
      Louisa May sempre foi uma grande apoiadora da carreira de seu pai e seus tios, por mais que não gostasse de muitas consequências da fama deles. Por isso, ela tentava viver uma vida discreta, mas a ideia de tornar a história do Queen em um filme acabou mudando os planos dela,  e sem que Louisa soubesse, para Gwilym Lee, fazer esse filme mudou os planos dele também. Os dois tentavam evitar o que acabou sendo inevitável. (se passa no universo de Pelo Olhar de Chrissie).
