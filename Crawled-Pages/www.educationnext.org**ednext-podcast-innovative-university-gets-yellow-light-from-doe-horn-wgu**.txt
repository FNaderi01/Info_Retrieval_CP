EdNext Podcast · Ep. 99 – Oct. 25, 2017: Innovative University Gets Yellow Light from DOE
Western Governors University has earned praise for its innovative model of competency-based learning. But the U.S. Department of Education’s Inspector General has called for the government to bar WGU students from federal student aid programs.
In this episode, Michael Horn of the Christensen Institute joins EdNext Editor-in-chief Marty West to discuss the WGU model and why a government audit found it wanting.
Horn wrote about this in a recent blog post, “Government Accountability Goes Unaccountable: Chilling WGU’s Innovation Engine.”
And Jon Marcus wrote a feature story on WGU for the Fall 2017 issue of Education Next: “Competency-Based Education, Put To The Test“
The EdNext Podcast is available on Apple Podcasts, Google Play, Soundcloud, Stitcher and here every Wednesday
