    Summary
      In one of Fat Gum’s favorite old shows, he’d heard someone described as, “Ordinary. The kind of beautiful, dangerous ordinary that you just can’t leave alone.” It always stuck out in his mind because he never really thought that line made much sense.Until now.Looking down at the totally exposed, peaceful sleeping face of Best Jeanist—Hakamata Tsunagu—wearing a wretchedly unfashionable, totally generic hospital gown, Fat Gum knew this was the kind of beautiful, dangerous ordinary that he just couldn’t leave alone.
