Samantha Indika de Saram (born September 2, 1973 in Matara), or Indika de Saram, is a former Sri Lankan cricketer, who played all format. He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm off-break bowler who usually occupies the position of wicketkeeper. He is a past student of St. Thomas' College, Matara.
Domestic career[edit]
A powerful batsman, Saram kept wicket and scored a vast number of runs for his school team, becoming one of the most reliable batsmen in the country, including an innings in which he alone scored 304 runs in just 149 balls. However, playing for his Test side, he was never really given a chance to shine, and he has not played a Test match for nearly six years, opting instead for the realms of Twenty20 cricket.
He has also played for Sultans of Sylhet in Bangladesh's NCL T20 Bangladesh.
He was a continuous member in Sri Lanka squad for Hong Kong Cricket Sixes competition, where Sri Lanka won the tournament under his captaincy in 2007.[1]
International career[edit]
He was a in and out member for the Sri Lanka team due to many permanent batsman retained in the squad. He is the 100th ODI cap for Sri Lanka as well.
After dropped from international squad in 2001, De Seram was brought in to the Twenty20 International team in 2009 for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, and played debut against India. This was the only match played by him until his retirement.[2][3]
