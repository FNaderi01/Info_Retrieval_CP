The Kids in the Spotlight Film Awards honored foster kid filmmakers on November 7 at the Darryl F. Zanuck Theater at the Fox Studios. Kids in the Spotlight’s Movies By Kids, For Kids Film Awards recognizes young filmmakers in foster care group homes.
Kids in the Spotlight (KIT) is a non-profit organization providing arts and healing programs to foster care facilities and schools throughout Los Angeles and surrounding areas. Founded by Earth, Wind and Fire’s Philip Bailey, 20th Century Fox sponsored the event alongside Music is Unity, Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment and CBS Studios.
“Kids in the Spotlight strives to support and educate the many foster youth in the Los Angeles area through film,” said Tige Charity, CEO of Kids in the Spotlight. “Our goal through KITS is to teach life and vocational skills through the real and poignant stories they tell.”

The award show was hosted by NBC “Modern Family” star Ty Burrell and included presenters Miles Brown from “Blackish”, Wendy Raquel Robinson from “The Game”, “The Cosby Show” star Malcolm-Jamal Warner, “Empire” star Mo McRae, Disney Channel star Skai Jackson and several other talented celebrities.
The film festival showcased and awarded 10-minute films written, casted and starring underserved youth. Children from the ages of 11 to 18 were trained for 10 weeks in the basics of filmmaking and editing software used to create feature films in Hollywood.
The teens involved made three films “Perfect Chemistry”, “Different Position” and “The New Comers”. “Perfect Chemistry” won the best ensemble cast. Some of the awards also included Best Film, Best Actor and Best Screenplay. The festival is also a means of fundraising for the organization to help fund future programs and projects.
The organization strives to create an environment for a kid that is cohesive, safe and imaginative beyond their circumstances. Stated in their press release Kids in the Spotlight “stimulates a greater belief in their ability to rise above social and economic conditions…The safe and creative environment fosters teamwork and discipline, resulting in a better self-image and a sense of accomplishment for kids who may not have the same opportunities as their peers.”
