The Education Exchange · Ep. 142 – May 18, 2020 – Detroit Students Get U.S. Constitutional Right to a Basic Minimum Education
			The co-leader of the Eversheds Sutherland Business and Commercial Litigation team, Rocco E. Testani, joins Paul E. Peterson to discuss a recent decision from the Sixth Circuit in the Gary B. v. Whitmer case. The court ruled that “substandard outcomes” in Detroit’s public schools violated a Constitutional right to a basic education for students, going against decades of precedent.
In a blog post for Education Next, “Federal Appeals Judges Discover Constitutional Right to ‘Basic Minimum Education’,” Joshua Dunn offers further analysis of the case.
