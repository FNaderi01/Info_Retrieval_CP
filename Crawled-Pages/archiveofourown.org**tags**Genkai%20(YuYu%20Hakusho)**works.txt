    Summary
      Shuichi had the potential for anything in life — he could be outrageously wealthy, successful in his ambitions, and could quite likely woo any woman he set his eyes on.
However, none of that interested him. Or so he thought. 
He longed for something more, something that sparked the thrill of adventure, purpose, and challenge.
He never could fathom how the call of the autumn wind would one day summon the side of him he left behind and bring to him a future, a love, worth protecting.
This is a wholesome and wistful account of Kurama, and how he finds a love so compelling that his world is shaken.  He meets phantoms of his past, and the sacrifices he makes to keep his loved one safe forces him to confront the piece of his soul that is demon.  Both Kurama and his beloved must overcome the darkness that threatens to destroy their future together.
[Reader x Kurama]

    Summary
      A series of drabbles. I hope some chapters interlock and connect together, and I will make a great effort to do so, but i can't make any promises. I hope that you enjoy this story! note: This was meant to be a 365 day challenge fic, but due to an incident now just gets updated when I can. I do plan to stop the fic at chapter 365 however.Tags, characters, and rating may adjust as the chapters post.

    Summary
      Yusuke is immature and brash, relying on foolhardy luck—this made him the right Spirit Detective for the time. But not much has changed. After the events of his youth, he tried to assimilate to normal life. He lost most everything he knew: purpose, excitement, and even his fiancée.Kazuma is goofy and noble, his intentions pure. He has strict principles that guide his decisions with fierce, decisive passion. He is responsible, having graduated from college with a decent job. But the one thing he wants is still a bit far from his reach.Hiei had a rough start in life. He doesn’t value relationships like most do, having never had reassurances. He is ambitious, a seeker of power, and is no stranger to working for his prizes. He can be callous but has an honor code and holds himself to a high standard in its application.Kurama is an enigma, a demon merged with the soul of a human. His time in Living World has changed him, and while he is content to be with his family and friends, he could do with some wonder in his life. He craves challenge and wit, puzzles that make the cogs in his mind turn.Destiny calls to you. Who will you fall for? [Reader x Yusuke/Kuzuma/Kurama/Hiei] A unique WWYFF-CYOA hybrid.

    Summary
      Kairi was not as strong as her brothers and she didn't start training to fight until she was eight-years-old. But the skill set of Goku's only daughter made her a perfect fit to be Spirit Detective. Much to the chagrin of demons (and friends, family, teachers, and Koenma), Kairi brings a distinct lack of patience and tendency to run off at the mouth to every confrontational situation. When her best friend Yusuke is hit and killed by a car and revived as her partner, Kairi learns secrets about her family, Spirit World, and some of her own secrets are brought to light. "I've spent so much time trying to close the gap between me and my brothers that I've never bothered to see if I was good at anything else."

    Summary
      This is an incredibly self-indulgent little story I've been toying with for a long time. This is only the second time I've ever shared my writing also, so there's that. 
Please enjoy my little story about Kurama and his half fox lover, Luna, the adoptive daughter of Genkai. Follow along as they navigate sharing Kurama's body between Youko and Shuichi and how they deal with endings and beginnings.

    Summary
      “Good night!” He responded and turned to walk home, Kurama’s bright emerald eyes and calm smile burning in his memory. The deep pain in his chest returned. It was hard to breathe, and the urge to cough became overwhelming. Kuwabara stumbled.He coughed, hacking up whatever blocked his airways. Even though only the streetlights illuminated him, he could still see deep red in his elbow crease. His heart stuttered for a second. Blood?But when he moved his arms, the red fluttered to the ground. He reached to pick it up. Petals. Rose petals covered in saliva. That came from his mouth.“Weird…” He muttered to no one. Noticing the pain had subsided, he left the petals on the ground and continued his walk home. (Kuwabara is completely head over heels for Kurama, and because of that, he's going to die)

This leads her back to Japan, to Genkai, and to a dreadful social interaction with a demon. Once assigned to a team with Hiei as a partner to protect demon-human alliances, Alexa and the former Spirit Detectives become targets for an archaic organization bent on complete segregation between the two worlds.Despite the terrible nature of the conspiracy that unfolds, she learns quickly that a sense of humor is a human's strongest asset, Hiei is an excellent(?) target for teasing, and Kurama is a subtly diabolical prankster.

    Summary
      With Koenma reinstated as the ruler of Spirit World and with his top two detectives fresh out of high school, there are plenty of missions to keep them busy.  But, one in particular gets the whole gang back together, as an artifact of exceptional power falls into the wrong hands.  However, these things are never as cut and dry as they seem.  But, Koenma has given them a lead.  Not just on someone who knows something about the device in question, but who has the right underground connections to get them close to it.  The catch?  That person is none other than Toguro-Ani.  (What you can expect from this story:)- Kuwabara being a sweet heart- Toguro-Ani/Elder Toguro being an asshole- Kuwabara's kindness melting Toguro-Ani's heart over time- Kurama and Hiei acting like an old married couple- Yusuke and Keiko acting like a young married couple- The redemption of a cruel villain- A tiny terror with a rough past, explored- Old friends making up after years of separation and animosity (Ani + Genkai)- Men with feminine sides- Slow burn love affairs- Secret soft sides- Steamy sex scenes- And much, much more! ^~
