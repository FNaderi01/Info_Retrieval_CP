                                                                        Hey!! Hope you’re well:) I had a question regarding the Outlander series, it seems that you’ve read the books and I wanted to ask about Fergus and Jamie’s relationship. Is it better than what is portrayed in the show? Is it significant? We are only shown a minimal amount and it saddens me bc Jamie has practically raised him as his own. And I hate myself for not reading the books first (I’ve started and love them so much!!) but I was just curious. Thanks in advance!! Take care :) 
                                                                    Let’s put it this way - the adaptation has proven problematic after S1 (maybe even towards the end where we didn’t get the important cave-healing scene). As for Jamie and Fergus - these two have a sweet and respectful relationship and it’s better in the books. Same goes for Jamie and Bree - their relationship is nothing like the show version. They had issues, which they managed and worked through in a generative manner. Book Bree is not as soulless as show Bree.
