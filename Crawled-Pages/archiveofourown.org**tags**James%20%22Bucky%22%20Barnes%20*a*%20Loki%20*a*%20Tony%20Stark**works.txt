    Summary
      "Yeah Mister Stark, its chill." Peter says with a shrug that only frustrates Tony more. He snorts out a breath, running his hands through his hair and whisper shouts, looking at the weirdly buff dude that seems oddly familiar from somewhere unsure where... and hisses. "What is going on? I just helped a little girl with really really cool skin and pretty eyes find her mummy.. Who turns out to be Fantine from that fu----orking awesome play! Who has three kids that I know are hers... And now I find you, my intern with a scary buff dude that kinda looks like white jesus with two other kids and I am so confused!!!" 
~~~~~
Loki dies after Thor: the Dark World and Hela, the goddess of death, gives him the ability to come back and live on midgard with his children who were imprisoned by Odin throughout the Nine Realms. She goes to Midgard and becomes a Broadway actress and continues to live a domestic life after finding Bucky Barnes and bringing him in. One day, at the opening night of Loki's play, Les Miserable, Tony Stark finds them and things change...maybe for the better?

    Summary
      It was his own brand of wooing and Bucky would really appreciate it if Natasha stopped teasing him about it. So what if he’d gone and accidentally fallen in love with the only married couple in the Tower? It was near impossible not to fall in love with Tony and Loki.

    Summary
      ***Please Read*** Okay, so, this is where all of the drabbles that would have occurred during OMMAMIW will be housed; they ARE NOT in chronological order (as my plot-bunnies are random, temperamental little creatures who strike when they feel like and don’t leave me alone until I write them down).There will be chapters featuring the character/relationship development of my sub-pairings too; again, this will be cited in each chapter summary.  Please review the chapter summaries before reading; here you’ll find the age-rating (as I have promised SMUT) and any other important info as I don’t want anyone to read something they’re uncomfortable with; my writing can get a bit wild and I know that this isn’t to everyone’s taste.Disclaimer: I do not own (or claim to own) any of the characters/settings used in this piece of non-profit fiction; I am merely using them/their likenesses for my own entertainment (and hopefully the entertainment of others). Enjoy ; )
