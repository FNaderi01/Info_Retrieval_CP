The team at GLOBO Productions, Inc., said they are pleased to announce the return by popular demand of “The Things that Make Me Cry” at the Barnsdall Gallery Theater in Los Angeles, California. Featuring a host of cast members, veterans of the stage such as Dorien Wilson (The Parker’s) and Lou Beatty Jr. (Boston Legal), the show brings to heart the ordinary and extraordinary ways that men feel to the stage, for audiences to enjoy through laughter, awareness, raw pain, and music. The diverse group of talented performers include Gilbert Glenn Brown (Dreamgirls), Gregory Niebel (A Patriot for Me), Rhonda Morman (Sunday Mourning) , Jimmy Walker, Jr. (My Name is Earl), Derek Shaun (Angels Over Tuskeegee), Phillip Cates (No Child Left Behind), Carlos Padilla, Jr. (Blind Rage).
Belinda Fruge’ (Stolen Breath the Truth Revealed) is new to the production and will play the role of Dr. Gloria.
During an outstanding, nationally prominent clinical psychologist career, Dr. Gloria Morrow a native of Los Angeles has taken the reins as playwright and executive producer of the dramatic play. The play is a touching stage adaptation based on Dr. Morrow’s acclaimed book, which bears the same title. It explores the interwoven stories of 13 men from their different perspectives of life, and come together at a barbershop.
        ADVERTISEMENT        
Each character features some type of personal pain—all hiding, searching, healing, loving, and looking for new beginnings or answers. Their stories are brought to life profoundly and musically in the barbershop. The scenes are breathtaking musically, electrifying and moving—the encounters are inspiring with groundbreaking thought.

The characters discover forgiveness, while every life is different; the pain is the same with the journey that men take to hide it.
“I’m looking forward to this third run of ‘The Things That Make Men Cry,’” said Morrow.
“Each actor brings a fresh take on the same script. It is amazing that this work continues to resonate with men, especially the men who live their experiences out on stage.”
The play is directed by Dinto Shorte’ (The Wanda Sykes Show) and casted by Jeannine Austin Fisher, who is making an impact in the entertainment industry by finding and casting talent for stage, screen, and television. The musical director is multi-talented Steven Wayne, singer, songwriter, arranger, and producer. The production features the creative talents of Zadia Ife, stage manager and set designer, Joel Daavid.
Evening performances are Friday and Saturday, June 24 and 25 at 8:00 PM, and Sunday, June 26 at 4:00 PM. Friday’s performance is a black tie/red carpet event. Tickets are available at: itsmyseat.com/TTTMMC or call (909) 985-3773.
