    Summary
      Tessa Evangeline "Evie" Locke is a wealthy woman, with a wealthy father, with a strong passion for adventure, and a strong disliking of waiting around and being bored to death by the suitors her father introduces to her. Sure, she loves needlepoint, but just like her mother, she wants more than a life of domesticity -- and a life that's more than domesticity is exactly what she's going to get.

    Summary
      Sheyanne was rescued long ago by a man she now knows as her closest friend, John Marston himself.  But that love soon turns to something else while she's in a relationship with none other than notorious gang-leader Dutch Van Der Linde. The relationships take turns over and over again, fighting for different reasons. She's soon caught up in a love-triangle that turns to shit over time. She may just be on the wildest ride she could only dream about, except its real. Realer than you can get.

      “These creatures are extremely territorial, Mr. Marston. Most importantly, once the inner beast chooses his mate, he will go to the ends of hell to bring it back. "The old gypsy woman's empty eyes caused John's spine to chill."B... but I am a man!" How could he be?The gypsy laughed at John's confusion. "That's what matters least. He chose you, John. The beast wants you, and I can see... he marked you. He will kill anything that is between you two, to protect you."In the background, a roar cut the air. "And he's here."

    Summary
      "We made a wrong choice, a series of them, but this one weighed heavier than anything the Van der Linde gang had felt before and that’s sayin’ something after what happened in Blackwater. Climbing up that blue mountain cost us more than the blood flowing through our fingertips. We would have gladly paid that price, as well as passed along every bottle in our carts if it meant that we’d be okay, but it wasn’t nearly enough."
John was being pulled in two directions. One where everyone was deciding that John's sole purpose in life is to be Jack's father and the other where John want's to keep being the outlaw he's always been. John has never really gotten what he wanted, especially when Arthur Morgan was involved, but maybe that's ok because with everything going on, maybe John will finally learn that what he wanted wasn't what he actually needed.

    Summary
      "The wolves in the woods have sharp teeth and long claws, but it's the wolf inside who will tear you apart."Charles has been running with the Van der Linde gang for around six months. They're not your typical gang, men and women, alphas, betas and omegas all working together.There were only three rules in the gang: no killing in camp, contribute to the camp’s donation box and no mates.But there was one unspoken rule: Arthur Morgan is off-limits.
