    Summary
      Prompt: Buck finds himself alone again after everyone bails on him so he decides to just head out of his own. He happens to cross paths with this photographer and her wife and they immediately want him to model for them. He agrees. The set up is a serene underwater shoot that helps Buck with lingering feelings about the tsunami. The photos are raw and emotive, showcasing Buck's catharsis. Buck gets an invite to the art show for the photos and brings the firefam along. They are floored. Buddie

    Summary
  Buck kneels down and looks at the wailing box with holes punctured on the closed flaps. His heart thuds in understanding and he quickly opens the flaps to find a newborn baby inside bundled in a blanket. He automatically takes the baby and the blanket into his arms cradling their head safely against the crook of his arm.
Or, a newborn is left at the 118 and Buck takes care of them until they can take them to the hospital.

    Summary
      Based on my Incorrect Buddie post, which you can find originally posted on my Tumblr and also included here with the fic.
"You, okay? You are my problem." 
"Fuck you, man," Eddie replies.
"Fuck me yourself, you coward!" The words are spat out without any thought, in typical Buck style, and a second after, everything freezes. Buck with horror, Chim with incredulous joy and the air itself with shock. If its molecules could gasp in telenovela, they probably would.

    Summary
      Ever since Buck moved in to the Diaz house, things have been moving smoothly- as though he truly belongs. Things have always been easy for them. And now they just became a little easier.
