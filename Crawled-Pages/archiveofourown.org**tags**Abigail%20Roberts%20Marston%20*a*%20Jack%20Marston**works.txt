    Summary
      “If he ever comes back here,” He whispered to the fire, the rage pumping through his veins with every beat of his heart, “I’ll make him wish he had died.”Hosea gave him a look over the fire, a soft, heartbroken thing, but Arthur could find no remorse within him to give.—The year John left and what could have been.

Notebooks and notebooks and notebooks (John was getting into making them these days, was filling a few himself too) filled with drawings of their family -- John and Abigail attempting a four-handed duet on their upright; Jack fallen asleep on Abigail's shoulder, John whittling beside her. Uncle and his banjo. Uncle asleep under a tree, Rufus tucked up against his knees. The sweater Abigail knit for Arthur, pencil line picking out every stitch.-John thanks his lucky stars for his family.

    Summary
      "No," he says, feeling his eyes crinkle in the pure delight of this moment, of having someone care this much, of having this woman who cares -- and he knows the moment John gets back and hears, he will do the same, offer to undo any insult Mary lobbed his way.-Arthur returns from meeting Mary Gillis, now Mary Abrams, and is happy to see his family.

    Summary
      John knew pain as well as he knew his own heart—not the pain of a wolf’s claws at your cheek and throat leaving eternal scars on an unkindly face, nor the pain of a gunshot wound bestowing copper stains on linen shirts and dirty skin, but pain, desperation, loss—the kind that tears apart the mind and soul until it fades like dust into the abyss, decorating the sky in its enigmatic constellations.He saw him, sometimes. A shadow in the distance, a shimmer of movement in his mind’s eye. But he could not—would not believe it. How could he? To believe would be to trust, and to trust would be to admit his undying desire to see him again, revealing all he so carefully buried long ago.What John didn’t know, however, was that Arthur still lived. Not in this world, perhaps, but in another far less fathomable one, watching from afar as John forged upon the lives and hopes that had been sacrificed for his and his family’s future. But could John, the man forever destined to delay the truth of his own heart, bring himself to believe again?
