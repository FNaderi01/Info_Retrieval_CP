    Summary
      I looked at Mycroft and thought about Sherlock's tells of him and his world  of goldfishes.And i realized that, when all this was over, I'd be left alone, barely breathing and completely broken. I'd be sad and miserable. It'd be so painfull that i might never be able to enjoy life again.Which is great. Fantastic. Tempting!Oh how i cant wait for that day to come. My name is Julie Jasmine Joyce, i'm the new secretary of Mycroft Holmes - a minor government official, and i think i'm having a massive crush on him.

    Summary
      Mycroft is the god of the underworld (Hades ) . Sherlock is the god of heaven (Zeus) and Sherrinford is the god of the sea (Poseidon)All reign in peace until inequality begins to bother one of the brothers. Someone must convince him to rule justly . But who is the right person for this task?This idea came to me while I dreamed my dear Mycroft . Obviously this will be a story Mystrade I'll work slowly when the muse decides to knock on my door . It is quite possible that the chapters are short .I would also like to add that although I am using mythology and would be quite correct, take artistic license on some things.Translation from the spanish fic of the same title

      It’d been a month since John was dropped off at Baker Street after his weekend with Mycroft and Greg and John was doing just fine, thank you very much. No one was asking questions, no one was babying him, and it almost seemed as if that weekend had never happened at all. And John was happy with it that way.That is... Until he gets sick and Sherlock gets hurt and John finds out that all might not be as it seems.

    Summary
      Alexithymia is the inability to describe or recognize your own emotions. A soulmate is a person ideally suited for another.
In this world, a black mark appears where their soulmate will first touch them.
One soulmate has alexithymia, the other just doesn't want to feel these emotions. How will this work? Especially when there are more pressing matters than their ability to feel for one another.

    Summary
      The rumors spread like dragonfire. There’s a new Dark wizard rising to power in the shadows, they say; the name Moriarty is whispered on trembling lips. The Ministry, they say, has been infiltrated by a mysterious witch of equally mysterious intentions. And everyone is curious about the new arrivals at Hogwarts, among them Professor Watson, the new Care of Magical Creatures teacher, and the newly appointed Headmistress: Eurus Holmes.The wizarding world is entirely unprepared for the malevolently organized chaos about to hit them over their heads. And that’s where Sherlock Holmes comes in. He’s a self-proclaimed investigative consulting Auror, a Defense against the Dark Arts professor, and most importantly, the cleverest man ever to grace the halls of Hogwarts (or so he says) - and perhaps the only one who can prevent the crumbling collapse of the entire wizarding world.
