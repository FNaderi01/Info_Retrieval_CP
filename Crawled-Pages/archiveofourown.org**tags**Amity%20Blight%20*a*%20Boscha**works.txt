    Summary
      Luz Noceda works at a hat shop in a small town, she's young and rather self conscious but very sweet. When she's cursed with the body of an old woman, she has to seek help from a self-indulgent yet rather insecure, young witch who lives with her friends in a legged, walking castle.!This is purely based off of the movie that came out in 2004, I have not read the book. Even then, I will add and remove scenes to make it match the plot better!

    Summary
      Los padres de Amity tienen un pequeño e hipócrita secreto que conlleva a que su hija menor se case con su "mejor" amiga de la infancia, pero... ¿Por qué ahora? ¿y por qué ella? Por razones lógicas, la mencionada no lo quiere permitir ya que es demasiada pequeña para tener encima esa gran responsabilidad, y además de que su corazón suspira el nombre de otra.¿Rebeldía o sumisión?
