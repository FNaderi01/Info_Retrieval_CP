    Summary
      "Do you miss me, Izuku?""I don't remember you, so there's not much to miss," Izuku says into the phone and adjusts the homework he had been working on onto his lap. Kacchan is messing with his computer watching a video of Gang Orca and barely spares him a glance. It doesn't occur to Izuku till after he's spoken that perhaps he shouldn't say such things to his father. But it doesn't matter in the end because the man on the other end of the phone laughs. Though not the soft melody Izuku is used to from his mother, its cold and lacking any actual humor.Izuku is 12."You're interesting. You know that, son? Your friend too. After all, I don't know many that can be so disinterested in what happened that day in the forest," His father says, and Izuku doesn't miss a beat."I'm sorry, dad. I'm not quite sure what you're saying," Izuku mutters into the phone. "But hey, what does five and three-sixths times seven-fifths times two-elevenths equal?""Izuku, you killed someone.""He tried to kill me first.""I know but, can you blame me for being surprised; after all, he had a very powerful quirk," His father said in an amused tone."Yeah and now I have a very powerful quirk."

    Summary
      This is just a collection of MHA/BNHA short stories I’m writing. Feel free to request something! I ship pretty much every ship between Izuku, Bakugo, Shoto, Kirishima, Kaminari, and sorta Shinsou. Pairings between those characters are cool with me and I’ll even do poly relationships! I’ll write ideas of my own too for sure!
