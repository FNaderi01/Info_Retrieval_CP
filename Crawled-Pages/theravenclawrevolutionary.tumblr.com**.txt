                                                    Me: Ya know, I always joke about how I‚Äôm probably not going to live past like 25 because I‚Äôm really freaking bad at taking care of myself, but how true is that really? Maybe I‚Äôm just subconsciously trying too hard to be edgy. I mean I always try and make sure my friends are happy and healthy so I can‚Äôt really be that bad.Also me: *Gets maybe 5 hours of sleep, doesn‚Äôt eat anything for roughly 24 hours, bites fingernails and fingers until I bleed more then once, procrastinates homework until the last minute and stresses the frick out, runs cross country and is always sore, marches snare drum and has a permanently screwed up back, drinks 10 cans off Pepsi every time I visit a certain friend‚Äôs house, makes dark, self-depricating, and dirty jokes to conceal how dead inside I actually am sometimes, tries to hide emotions until I can‚Äôt possibly do it anymore and has a mental breakdown* Ah yes‚Ä¶ The epitome of health! What a healthy boi I am.

Kinda like historical aus and even tho dressing is not always accurate imo they at least try it to talk about real events. There's a lot of alternative endings, some dumb stuff too, but in general it's pleasant. Not only Marie Antoinette story but also the one about a reporter in early 20th century New York trying to solve a mystery of a mental hospital

But the game at least let the Queen romance with the king which is a great relief and he is a big cinnamon roll I love him By the way this is me and if you wanna add me just search LisaLisa for the username or the ID on the pic (I crafted basically all outfits required in the stages and you guys can borrow from my shared wardrobe)Sooooooo like, My overall rating for this game is 3.5 out of 5, for the reasons of great game interface but bad (and historically inaccurate) designs.Here are some things that bugs me from the Marie-Antoinette book: For most of the outfits she seemed most like wearing a corset (*or no shaping garments considering she‚Äôs rather skinny) which makes her not having the fashionable silhouette during the time when the story was set (*I mean the flat front, conical upper body in the pre-revolution times) Originally posted by nolynsdoodlesYou could see this in the costumes set in musicals like ‚ÄúHamilton‚Äù which was also set in the late 18th century (*for act 1 at least)But like, What the bloody hell is this bodice like the shape of her breasts is too prominent and not pushed up- Very out-of-place outfits Wtf is this 1830s/1840s outfit doing in this Ancien Regime story-But I promise this is not the worst for ‚ÄúDress Up! Time Princess‚Äù‚Äîthe sets in the 20th century America one is nightmare for every fashion history lovers Before I put on my ongoing rant, I love love love the story so much and have been simping for Mr. Puzo and this is probably the best book for this game so far. I heard that the developers is going to release a new story which is based on the Swan Lake and hopefully it would be a great one as well (the sets from the trailer are pretty ngl). Also, this is really just my own opinion on the sets of ‚ÄúGotham Memoirs‚Äù and please don‚Äôt be offended if I have roasted your favourite setThe story was set in the ‚ÄúRoaring 20s‚Äù (*as the trailer from the official Facebook page of the game has mentioned), but I am HONESTLY disappointed at the sets. Spoiler: The Great Gatsby has been published at the time at the time of the story was set, so I actually narrowed the time period down to late 1920sFirstly, this dress looks like what you will get on Amazon for 1920s Halloween costumes‚Äîlike what the f is this monstrosity which is likely be inspired by the costumes of the Great Gatsby movie, which is known to be not 100% historically accurate?If I were the designer I would change (just some because a bit too lazy to point out all):Give the dress two shoulder straps. This makes the garment look more 1920s Give her shoes with no bare toes Make the dress look (slightly) looser to achieve the fashionable androgynous silhouette in the 1920s (now it looks a bit too feminine to me) [actually I‚Äôve checked the CG again and the dress looked a bit looser but still the shoulder straps and the shoes...üåö]Like basically this is how a roaring 20s flapper look is like:P.s. given the fact that the dress was supposed to be an evening gown, I somehow would opt to lower the hemline as well but yeah I just treat it as a flapper dress And here‚Äôs another one- 3 things I would like to change:Waistline (make it even and drop-waist which is what I saw in pretty much a lot of the 1920s day dress)Gloves (it looks a bit like opera gloves now, ngl) Neckline (it doesn‚Äôt look right tbh)This one is one of my favs to be honest, also some more period-accurate ones among all the sets in this story. The rest is monstrosity. Like this one looks like an imitation of a 70s does Edwardian outfit which is totally out-of-place for the story but this is not the worst-WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS 60S OUTFIT DOING?!Yeah the set is called ‚ÄúPromising Politician‚Äù and I could see where it‚Äôs from (frankly it gives me so much of the Jackie Kennedy vibes) but this is one of the worst outfits produced by the game... like seriously???? 20th century western fashion changed A LOT over decades and the set designers should go study fashion history and look up pics on 1920s fashion. The outfit sets from this story somehow is a very big turn off for me who loves vintage fashion so much and I am just hoping when the game is producing another story with a time period specified, more historically accurate outfits. The game is actually able to design some very historically-accurate outfit sets (like the Madame Pompadour dress which sadly I cannot really post it here because of the 10 image limit of tumblr posts), but like, though somehow I appreciate a degree of creative liberties (and functional alterations) when it comes to historical costume designs, I genuinely dislike when most of the outfits in the story are too out-of-place (with ‚ÄúReign‚Äù as a prominent example of very bad costume designs). So, in terms of just outfits, I would have rated the game 2.5 to 3 out of 5. Nevertheless, I still would recommend this game to everyone who loves being in stories or such, because this game is just so addictive and funüôà

I just take pieces with the best stats and fuck how I look like ajhahshs The only + is that you can see patterns, but hell they could have done it better

                                                    On a scale of 1 to Miku Binder Thomas Jefferson how cringe is imagining some of my favorite French revolutionaries  as modern teenagers and drawing them out while bored in class? I mean I kept their historical personalities and how they are often depicted/pictured in mind as I drew them and stuff. I wanted it to be pretty accurate. Well as accurate as you can be with bullcrap like this. I dunno. I mean I already know I‚Äôm cringey. That just kinda how I am. But I really don‚Äôt wanna go all that era kind of cringe‚Ä¶ I guess I just have fun imagining my favorite historical figures in a modern setting. That on its own isn‚Äôt cringe. Not really. I don‚Äôt think it is anyway‚Ä¶ But what about the rest? I dunno what this is anymore. What is my life? What is this blog other then a hellscape of trashy ‚Äòcontent ‚Äô?  I suppose imma just live my life and enjoy myself doing whatever the heck I‚Äôm doing. And I guess if any of you are interested I‚Äôll let you see it. Maybe even some 'headcannons ‚Äô of sorts. Ew. That‚Äôs what makes it cringe isn‚Äôt it. Honestly idk. Idk where I was going with this. Sorry. Carry on.

                                                        I probably should have started with that lol. I‚Äôm a percussionist and I play snare drum for our marching band. Sometimes I play bass drum and drumset, but usually only for pep band. And then I do all the little less cool percussion stuff every once in a while during concert band.But yeah. Just your average crackhead percussionist over here!

Ya know one of those undisputed facts like the sun is hot, Ashley‚Äôs not going to play  or march correctly during band, Coronavirus is a problem, Robespierre wasn‚Äôt really a dictator‚Ä¶ You get what I‚Äôm saying. Those sort of obvious facts. I‚Äôm sure you see my point, darling‚Ä¶
