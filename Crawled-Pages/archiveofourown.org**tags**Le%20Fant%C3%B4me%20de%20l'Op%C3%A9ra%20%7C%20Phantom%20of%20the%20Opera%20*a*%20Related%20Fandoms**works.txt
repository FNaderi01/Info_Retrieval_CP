    Summary
      Christine struggles with depression and hysteria, having lost herself in a 7-year marriage to the Vicomte. Having twin girls; one who bears a birthmark across half of her face, the three travel to the countryside of Lourmarin, as Raoul's family will not accept this child. It is there, where Christine's demons subside, and where she falls desperately into the arms of a mysterious and powerful man with half a marred face.

    Summary
      The vicomte has lost his wife and subsequently everything else. A recluse hiding within the rooms of his dead father’s house, he resigns himself to alcohol and does his best to blunt the residual pain. Months of numbness pass before he thinks that the opera ghost might like to hear the news of Christine’s death. He’s not the only one who thinks so: he receives a note from Madame Giry that, just like him, the opera ghost is wasting away, dying below the streets of Paris. Giry tasks the vicomte with retrieving the dying ghost to save his life, but the vicomte has other plans: to put the wretched creature out of its misery once and for all.It does get happy.

    Summary
      Three months after he turned 22, Raoul made the brash decision to leave all he's known behind and went into business of running an Opera with incompetent fools.He's the proud Stage Papa of 36 talented people, best friend to a stage manager with crippling anxiety, casually courting a sociopathic murder addicted "ghost," and just doing his best to save the Opera Populaire from any sordid thing that comes their wayand if you don't like all that he do, you can suck a duck . . .Raoul: It's not always doom and gloom at the Opera. Sometimes it's weird, fun, and unusual. Sometimes.

    Summary
      They say the Angel of Music of the Opera House has a mysterious teacher. Her voice is enchanting, almost etheral.Acting in place of the previous primadonna, who stormed out over... contractual disagreements... you work the stage and breathe new life into its performances.However, people are curious about who this mysterious 'teacher' could be. And truth be told, so were you. With this thought coupled by the threats of a mysterious 'Phantom of the Opera', this performance season was bound to be thrilling.Would you keep your position as a lead performer? Would you discover the mysterious man who had been haunting your dreams? Would a rediscovery of childhood love throw another spanner into the works?And most importantly, who was The Phantom of the Opera? // Yes I'm rewriting POTO except it's Kylo x Reader. I love to watch the world burn!
