    Summary
  “Hey, Alpha,” Stiles says, and Derek drops his bag and wraps his arms around Stiles’ back. He presses his face into Stiles’ neck, muscles relaxing the way they haven’t since the full moon.
  Stiles huffs, hugging him back just as tightly. “Missed you, too, big guy.”
When Stiles and Scott travel back home for winter break, Derek and Cora join them for their stay. Home, where Stiles struggles to ignore the memories that being with his mother’s pack always brings. The more Derek discovers about Stiles’ past, the more he thinks about his own family. Moving forward means confronting his fears in the one place he swore he would never step foot in again: Beacon Hills. Of course, Stiles would never let him go alone.

    Summary
      "You don't deserve him," the older man said, "You don't deserve him whispering your name while I touch him"Derek tried not to think about that. About Deucalion being that close to Stiles. That man already took enough from him. "And you do? You tortured him, his friends, you think everyone else forgot about that?" Derek couldn't go without knowing the truth, "What did you do to him, hm?Beat him till he forgot about what you did? You can't fool me, tell me!"Deucalion laughed at that. Then with all the casualty he leaned into Derek's face and whispered,"He came to me."

    Summary
      Stiles Stilinski is old, older than what many people may think. Being born under a blood moon back when the world was so incredibly young he was birthed to the world as a Grim. Grims, beings that are ancient, powerful even. When his best friend gets bitten by an alpha and the threat of hunters looms over not only Scott’s but also his own head, Stiles must join together with a pack of wolves to protect those he loves, even if it means showing the wolves what he truly is, even if it means he spills human blood. OrStiles is a vampire who could not keep his fucking face out of the media throughout the years. The Argents, damn their souls, decided to try to take out him while trying to do whatever is on their shady looking calander  and Stiles is having none of it.+ the pack doesn’t know why Stiles hasn’t died yet and why most supernatural creatures decide to not try kill him.

    Summary
      Deucalion had known that loving a human was a risky affair, since human bodies could only take so much damage before they broke beyond repair, he’d known this while he gave his heart to a human. He loved the man who capture his heart, enough so to marry the man, and start a family with him. Still, the reminder that his husband did not heal as he did, that infections and bullets could take him so easily, was not needed and yet Deucalion had been reminded of this fact fairly recently.

    Summary
      There was nothing in this world that made him feel stronger, taller, graceful than ballet. The injuries, the pains of it, was durable when the result was feeling if only for a moment as graceful, as stunning, as impressive as his uncle still did whenever he performed. When Stiles danced, he felt a special connection to his mother, and when he caught the pride in the eyes of his father when he nailed a sequence of difficult moves Stiles felt a little bit less guilty for being the reason his mother was forced to hang-up her ballet shoes.

    Summary
      THIS STORY WILL BE COMPLETELY OC IN THE BEGINNING. THERE WILL BE CHANGES TO THE TEEN WOLF PLOT AS THE STORY PROGRESSES.
I am a Hale
Teen wolf was never a show I thought much on. It was just something I watched in passing every Friday or Tuesday or whatever. I wasn't obsessed with it, I didn't follow the actors or ship characters or even cry and scream over every death and new development like some did. Watching Teen Wolf was something I did to kill time. I was impartial to the show but if asked I could summarize and list all the characters and the seasons. So when Death came knocking on my door with intention of taking my life well I was surprised. It was unexpected and a shock. It would have been the most shocking thing to have happened only…. It wasn't. The biggest surprise of my life was when I got reborn as the Alpha Legend Talia Hale….. And wasn't that just something.
-This does mean I will be making changes to the teen wolf plot !!

    Summary
      They were a myth. As a whole a majority of the planet did not believe that the supernatural was real. They were the subject of entertainment for movies and stories alike. Then again, so were aliens, and they turned out to actually exist too. Well...what they say about secrets is true, the truth never stays hidden forever. Its just nobody thought the truth would come out exactly the way it did...

    Summary
      Scott and Deucalion go skinny dipping in Duke's swimming pool. Inevitably, this leads to sex.I don't specify Scott's age in the story, so this can be read as either underage or not. If that squicks you then don't read. I marked this as Underage just to be safe.This is part 1 in a series of unconnected vignettes centering on Scott and his various relationships with older men.

          Part 1 of Scott's Multiverse of Daddies
