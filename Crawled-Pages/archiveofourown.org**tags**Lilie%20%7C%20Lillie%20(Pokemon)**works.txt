    Summary
      As Goh was trying to catch a Pokémon in the water (after Ash tied with Bea), Ash got an announcement that The World Coronation Series will be put on hold until further notice. This caused the two to be at the lab a little more often then normal. Goh notices Professor Cerise is acting a little secretive, and decided to investigate without Ash knowing. What he finds out will turn his life upside down... and it's up to Ash and many of his old companions to stop whatever Goh learned!
This entire story is a Prologue to a 'Betrayal' story that's different then what you're used to: Take an Extra Step, GOH the Extra Mile
The story also begins right at the end of "Satoshi VS Saito! Overcome Octopus Hold!" (Ash VS Bea rematch episode/Episode 39 of Pokémon Journeys.)
Also a cross-post with Wattpad (GreninjaGirlYuki) - Will have exclusive art there sometime after story is complete!

    Summary
      Instead of getting Pikachu on his first day as a Pokémon trainer, Ash Ketchum finds himself Aura-bonded with a Riolu one innocuous night. This little detail sets off ripples of change that completely shake up his journey to greatness. While being a Pokémon Master has a nice ring to it, being an Aura Guardian throws open a completely different set of experiences that will shape this adolescent into a man of power feared by those who wish to bring harm to the world.This is Ash's story, of how he became the greatest Aura Guardian since Sir Aaron, his tribulations travelling the world, and finding people who he would share his heart with forever.

    Summary
      A thrown-aside comment on the ethics of Mega Evolution and Z-Moves by a well-known journalist, blossomed into whole nations throwing the blame at each other for misusing those special evolution/moves. Which thenceforth sparked the first international war in centuries.Kanto, Johto, and Kalos formed the UKJK. Sinnoh, Hoenn, and Unova formed the AHSU. Alola and Galar formed the UGAA.[10/2020] New title, new description, and fixed chapter 1 so it flows better.

    Summary
      A CODE is a gene found in people, allowing them to enhance/enchant their weapon of choice in order to keep Ultra Beasts at bay. The CODE started to appear when the UBs became more frequent in the world, causing massive damage on the cities they arrived in, killing several. When the CODE started to appear and who were the first to have one is a mystery, but they didn’t question it, as it allows them to fight back in order to survive. After a nuclear like explosion in Kanto, the entire region ended up in an apocalyptic state, and it has since been like that for two decades. Several corporations have gotten special permission to wander into the lost region, searching for lost documents of the CODE and its evolution in the several research labs.

    Summary
      Because of the idea her parents wanted a boy, Goh acted up like one since childhood and everyone believed she was one. Goh was happy with that, but while becoming older she began to feel uncomfortable and guilty because it was all just a lie. She decides to clarify the truth.Of course it's not easy to talk about her true feelings, but especially Ash is like a difficult obstruction. It's like a curse that there's no good time for Goh to have that important talk with him. But she doesn't know she's not the only one hiding secrets.
