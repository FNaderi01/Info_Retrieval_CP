    Summary
      Well isn’t this just swell. Fucking amazing	It’s not every day that you end up approximately three hundred fucking years in the future. Fantastic. Well, you may be asking, “Well Five how did you get into this situation?” Boy does he have a fucking story to tell.	It all started right after the second apocalypse had ended and he was taking all of his family back to 2019 a few days after the previous apocalypse. And may he add, that these apocalypses happened back to back within the span of 2 of the most hellish weeks in his 58 years alive. Now he can fully say that he was trapped in the body of a 13-year-old Number Five, 300 years in the future. And almost everyone has superpowers. Wait, what?

    Summary
      Five put all his effort into keeping his family alive. He felt his power drain into them, keeping their bodies alive and their minds intact. He tried to focus on sending them to the same destination, so much so that he couldn't feel himself tearing apart at the seams. He definitely didn't mean to find himself in the 1980's.Will had been cycling home after what had to be the most disappointing game of Dungeons and Dragons in his life when he meets a very interesting boy. Said boy has a number for a name, mysterious powers, a connection to another secret organization, and won't stop bleeding. Will was not going to let him work himself to death, though this boy would certainly try.

      Five was covered in blood. There was a ringing in his left ear. In the distance he could hear sirens wailing, but it all sounded muffled, overshadowed by the roaring in his mind.  They had been here for him. They knew that he could time travel. He needed to leave, now. -The want to escape becomes a need. The danger is real now, and it isn't just coming from bank robbers.Or, the reckoning of Number Five.

    Summary
      Things aren’t good, but Ben can’t remember them ever being good. He can’t remember normal. He can only remember being turned into a weapon before he ever had a chance to be a child.Five is an assassin and Allison’s throat will be damaged for a long time and Klaus’ boyfriend died and Diego’s not-girlfriend died and Vanya has world-destroying powers and Luther has the body of an ape and Dad is dead. Things are fucked up. They’ve always been fucked up.But the difference, now, is that Ben has hope. Klaus is sober for the first time since he was fourteen. Vanya knows about her powers and they’re figuring out how to work through them without Dad or her shady ex-boyfriend trying to control things. Allison’s planning on taking them all to meet Claire soon, once they’ve healed a bit more. Luther and Diego are still little shits, but you know, that can’t really be helped.(And, of course, the apocalypse has been averted by a single hug and a door opening. That’s a pretty important improvement.)-All the main sections of "tell my father (this is my life)," in one convenient place.

    Summary
      For a long time Vanya considered it one more reason she didn’t work right. It didn’t make her average; it made her broken. Her therapist said she had a self-defeatist attitude and that it was perfectly normal to feel the way she did.
