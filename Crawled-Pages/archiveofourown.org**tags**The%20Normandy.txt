Everyone believes that Shepard is dead including Nihlus until he gets a message from Tali one day. Told from Nihlus's POV. Rated Mature for language and possible usage of the 'F' word.

    Summary
      I grunt from the impact with the wall, hands above my head with no escape Garrus practically purrs at me. "I think you like provoking me, just to see how long it would take until I snap. My control isn't limitless kid, why you try to push it I don't know but you should really stop." I smirk and hook a leg around his waist before drawing him into me, forcing moan to leave us both as one of his hands latch onto my hip and help me grind into him while the other squeezes my wrists. "You have no idea what you're getting yourself into Kolyat, I could severely hurt you." I moan and arch into him from the friction, wanting this more than anything. "You have no idea what I can take." With that, I bite at one of his mandibles while arching into him at just the right angle and receive a deep animalistic growl from him."Don't say I didn't warn you."
