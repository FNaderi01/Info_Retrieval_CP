    Summary
      After a traumatic breakup, Yamaguchi Tadashi seeks change. It isn't until four years later that Tsukishima Kei realizes exactly what that change is. Now it's his job to get his childhood friend back. However, that may be a little difficult since Yamaguchi has an entirely new life, one with an alcoholic boyfriend and a child on the way. Will Tsukishima be able to save Yamaguchi from the abuse and depression he's been living with all this time? Will Yamaguchi ever see himself as more than an object?
Super angsty. Will update in ambiguous intervals. Enjoy!

Enjoy :)[ WARNING ]Some of the characters may be a bit out of character. I apologize.

    Summary
      Our story starts with the moon. Obscured by a receding storm cloud, it hangs low in the sky, a thin crescent staring at all that happens below it. It has always been adept at watching, observing humanity and the coils of mortality far beyond it, an immortal presence, revered and feared all at once.It watches, on this particular night, as a figure makes their way through recently rain-soaked foliage, dewdrops glistening in the moonlight falling around them in an ethereal chorus, almost silent. Rivulets fall as their hand drags over and through the brush, as they listen to the sound of nothingness. Their pack weighs heavily upon their back, not only with mortal weight, but with trepidation.[Yamaguchi strays into the forest, dissatisfied with the world they were born into. A chance meeting with a moon god, a deal, and a youkai town offers him new hope, and a new life.]

    Summary
      Since starting college, Yamaguchi has been different: he talks more, is more outgoing, and is...gay. Which doesn't bother Tsukishima. But with how much Yamaguchi has evolved, will he be left behind? Or will he be incredibly dumb and let Yamaguchi go while he messes with Kuroo?

    Summary
      Tadashi decided to remain with the circus troupe. There wasn’t any reason not to – no memory of a welcoming place could plague his thoughts, and the fear, the everlasting fear of having to run away, still shook him deep into his core. So Tadashi stayed, and he learned. Not what you’d learn in school, but skills nonetheless, and at the age of eighteen, he could say for himself that he could throw a knife into a man’s skull from fifteen feet away – or, as he more often did, juggle with torches and ribbons.“Come see the circus !” he’d say to passers-by, and they’d look at him in his colourful outfit – minty blue and orange hues, dazzling with sparkles – and they’d smile and know the circus was in town. They came back, sometimes, to this lost city of theirs, and Tadashi soon understood that he was not the only one to have lost something important in this place, something worth coming back for.--tsukiyama circus au for the hqss
