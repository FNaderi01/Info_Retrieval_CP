    Summary
      In Wei Ying's own darkness, He found Lan Zhan as his amethyst. Amethyst: Amethyst is a stone of spiritual protection and purification; cleansing one's energy field of negative influences and attachments. It creates a resonant shield of spiritual light around the body. It is a natural tranquiliser, that relieves stress and strain, soothes irritability, balances mood swings, dispels anger, rage, fear and anxiety. Alleviates sadness and grief, and dissolves negativity. Amethyst activates spiritual awareness, opens intuition and enhances psychic abilities. Wei Ying was trying so hard to maintain his family. Everything was going pretty much good. Suddenly, they needed money to return to the creditor which his dad had taken. He found everything shattering. He needed money. That's when, with the help of his friend, Huisang , he met Lan Zhan as his sugar daddy.

    Summary
      Wei Wuxian dies at twenty-two and doesn’t come back. Lan Wangji dies in an “unfortunate accident” in a temple in Yunping at thirty-seven. The world moves on.Thousands of years later, Wei Ying and Lan Zhan have a senior thesis in cultivation to co-write on the Yiling Patriarch. It doesn’t go exactly how they were expecting.-“I still do not understand why you were able to read the journal in the first place,” Lan Zhan says. Wei Ying grins. “You’ll laugh,” he says. He won’t, of course. Lan Zhan doesn’t laugh. But maybe he can swing a smile. “It’s because of the name thing. He wrote his name into the scrambling talisman. So it says that no one can undo the lock but Wei Ying.” He hooks a thumb at himself. Everyone’s always said his name is unlucky. This is the first time it’s worked out in his favor. It’s not a coincidence either; apparently his mother thought it would be funny. Mrs. Yu had told him that with a curl in her lip, as if it didn’t make him wish he knew his parents even more.

    Summary
      He only dreamed about joining his father in the tile business to learn the craft. Although, the idea of designing things never appealed to Yibo very much. He just admired it when his father made the pieces of art and gifted it to him when he was finished. Each intricate detail in the tiles pronounced the amount of love and care that went into them, so Yibo held them to his heart always. However, that dream was no longer in his reach. or After Yibo’s father is caught in a tragic accident at his work place, his family is left with no source of income. In place of his mother, Yibo works as a butler at the Xiao Estate.

    Summary
      He’d come here for years and felt sometimes as though he knew the floor plan better than he knew himself. He forewent active participation, which many of the regulars found strange, but this month he could feel he needed something more than watching someone else’s play. It was just he didn’t know what he wanted or how he was going to get it. Wei Ying works as a bartender in a sex club, but he is not only a bartender. Lan Zhan frequents said sex club. They don’t actually have sex in the sex club, which is a pity to neither of them somehow.
