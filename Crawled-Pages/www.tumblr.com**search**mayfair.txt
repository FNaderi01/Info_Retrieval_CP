Brice Marden at Gagosian Grosvenor Hill, London, opens tomorrow, Tuesday, October 3, 6‚Äì8PM GMT. Don‚Äôt miss it!! Since resuming his engagement with ‚Äúterre verte‚Äù Marden has begun layering oil paint of this single color, focusing his conditions in order to heighten them, so to speak. Thus ‚Äúterre verte‚Äù is both medium ‚Äúand‚Äù subject for Marden as he explores its chromatic nuances while reflecting on the material exigencies of painting itself. http://fal.cn/tatJ

            Moodboard Challenge        A huge thank you to @outlanderlush‚Äã and @iamnottrisha‚Äã for organizing this. The moodboard belongs to @outlanderlush‚Äã, the story belongs to you all. Hope you enjoy.AO3¬†/ Magnolias In Bloom Master Fanfic ListMayfairThis was not his sort of scene at all. James Fraser stepped silently behind his colleagues into the smoky darkness of The Mayfair Club. The boys had insisted, to celebrate their law firm‚Äôs latest contract. The pulsating beat spilled out onto Dover street and Piccadilly, as the hour grew close to midnight. He‚Äôd heard of this place. He‚Äôd never had reason to visit it, though. He found his thrills elsewhere: in the courtroom, in a swimming pool, and a few years ago, in Afghanistan.He imagined he could feel the scar tissue on his back prickling in apprehension as scantily clad serving staff paraded by, balancing loaded trays. It was Friday night and Mayfair was jumping.Raucous calls greeted the group, as the manager slapped Dougal‚Äôs back and set the men up at a prime table in the middle of the club, from where they could monitor all the action. The d√©cor was lush and elegant, as befitted one of the most exclusive gentlemen‚Äôs clubs in London. They were immediately plied with champagne in silver buckets; one word from the manager, and Jamie found the group surrounded by swatches of bare skin. Women danced all around them, lively with the prospect of huge tips. John Grey, an Englishman in the midst of Scots who did not care overmuch for the attentions of women, sat back and laughed at Charlie Stewart and Dougal MacKenzie‚Äôs exploits. For once mindful and respectful of the club‚Äôs rules, they kept their hands to themselves, but that did not stem their lewd comments and lascivious stares. All of it made Jamie feel slightly ill.He took a seat next to John, shaking his head politely at a blonde girl who offered to dance for him. Instead, he ordered a whisky neat, crossed his legs, pulled out his phone, and settled in for a long night.And then he saw her. Keep reading
