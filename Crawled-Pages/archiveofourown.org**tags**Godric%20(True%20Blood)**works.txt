    Summary
      You are an impossible thing. A human that can' t be glamoured. That's faster and stronger than most. That can see and hear nearly as well as the vampires that raised you. Some might have killed you, but the man-the vampire-that found you and raised you as his own saw you for what you truly were. A tool.Eric Northman and you were drawn together from the moment you met. Misunderstandings and pride separated you for three years until you accompanied your friend to a seedy vampire bar. The Viking is stunned to see you and unwilling to allow you to escape his grasp for a second time. As the two of you once again become entangled in each other's lives, the truth that comes to light will change both of your lives forever. As it turns out, you are far more impossible than anyone imagined.

    Summary
      For many a century, Godric had lived for the hunt. It was to kill or be killed for him. Revel in the blood, sex, and death that came with being a Vampire, or miss the glory of being one. But bloodthirsty and vengeful, he no longer is. There is a chilling calmness to him, and he is now ready to meet the True Death to atone for all he's committed in the past--until a very human Mila enters his life and challenges everything he's ever known.Striking a deal with Eric Northman to save her mother's life, Mila thought it would be the easiest thing she'd ever do, but after suffering the explosion in Godric's nest, her life is caught up in the most ruthless yet passionate, horrific yet exhilarating, agonizing yet utterly magnificent ride ever.Now, torn in two, Godric must make the ultimate choice: meet the True Death and finally find peace or fight his way into Mila's heart and finally know heaven.**posting first three chapters in one go**

    Summary
      For millennia Godric has taken at will. Blood. Life. Even Eric. One night, a young woman invites him on a magical, unexpected walk into the desert. Rosalyn moves through this world to a different drumbeat, confounding and inspiring those around her. Can Godric and Eric follow her call to give back more than they take? And will the vampire community's ancient order let them?
