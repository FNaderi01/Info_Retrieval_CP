Celebrity Photographer Ian Foxx and Actor Tommy Ford Team Up for a Hilarious Look at Sexual Addiction            
				By Sentinel News Service

Officials at FOXX Media Group LLC in conjunction with Foxx Follies Films said they are happy to announce that its award-winning web series, “The Club,” starring actor Tommy Ford, launched on November 17.
“The Club” racked up various awards on the web series/film festival circuit. The web series picked up Best Faith-Based Web Series for director Ian Foxx and Best Comedic Actor for Ford, respectively at the Miami Web Fest. In July, the web series screened internationally in South Korea as a special selection in the Korean Web Fest (KWEBFEST), the only web series festival held in Asia. This spring, “The Club” made its debut at the LA Web Fest, the oldest and largest web series in the world. It nabbed several awards, including Best Ensemble in a Comedy Series, Best Writing in a Comedy Series and Best Premise in a Comedy Series. It was also nominated for Best Director, Outstanding Writing and Best Comedy Series.
Helmed by Foxx, a celebrity photographer-turned-director, “The Club” is a faith-based, comedy series, inspired by past scandals of ministers, helming mega churches. The 5-minute episodes follow the trials and tribulations of Rev. Lamont Holmes Jr. (Tommy Ford, “Martin”), accused of illicit behavior and extra-marital affairs that’s certainly unbecoming for a man of the cloth. To gain forgiveness and reconciliation from his flock, he enters a sex addiction treatment program, only to discover “The Club.”

“And let’s just say that this clandestine fraternity of sex addicts may or may not help Rev. Holmes kick the habit,” offered a representative from FOXX.
        ADVERTISEMENT        
“Like a secret handshake, tune in to find out why the men chant ‘Boom Shaka Laka Boom!’”
Ford, best known for his role as Tommy on the FOX hit TV show, “Martin,” serves as a co-executive producer on the project.
Along with Ford, the cast includes Bill Lee Brown (“Scrubs,” “Criminal Minds” and “Baggage Claim”), Mark Christopher Lawrence (“Chuck,” “Glee,” “My Name Is Earl”), Dan Thiel (“Deep Blue Sea,” “Tuesdays With Morrie”), Tanjareen Martin (“The Rev,” “Love for Sale,” “Miss March”), Miguel A. Gaetan (“Drumline,” “Material Girls”) and Stacy Francis (“R&amp;B Divas LA,” finalist of “The X Factor USA”). “The Club” is written by Ilunga Adell, a veteran TV writer and producer whose credits include “Sanford &amp; Son,” “227,” “Roc,” “A Different World,” “Married With Children,” and “Moesha” – just to name a few. Foxx also serves as co-executive producer and co-creator of “The Club.” The music score is composed by Eric Butler.
