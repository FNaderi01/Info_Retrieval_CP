    Summary
      “You think you know me,” Klaus said, breathless and shaky, lacking his usual bravado. The flush had crept up his neck to his cheeks and into the whites of his eyes, for now they were pink. In contrast beads of sweat rolled down the sides of his face and pooled in the dip at the base of his throat. He turned his head sideways to avoid Ben’s eyes. “You know shit, Ben. If you really knew me, you’d know me to be a freak that gets a raging hard-on because his very dead, very juvenile brother is pinning him against the bed.”Set pre-season 2.
