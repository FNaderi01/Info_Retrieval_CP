    Summary
      Eijirou looks at the talisman. And then does a double take. “This just says ‘fuck off’ in kanji,” Eijirou says to Midoriya.“It’s very effective,” Midoriya says to Eijirou.“What the hell is going on,” Jirou says to the room. (In which the dorms are haunted and Midoriya is an exorcist. In, you know, a manner of speaking.)
