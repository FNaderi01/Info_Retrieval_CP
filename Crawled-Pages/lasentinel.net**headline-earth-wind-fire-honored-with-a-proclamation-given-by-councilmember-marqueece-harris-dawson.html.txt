Councilmember Marqueece Harris-Dawson and the city of Los Angeles honored the legendary Earth, Wind &amp; Fire by debuting September 21 “Earth, Wind &amp; Fire Day” after one of their most popular songs, “September.”
The celebratory event took place on September 10, 2019, in the City Council Chambers downtown Los Angeles. City Council President Herb J. Wesson welcomed everyone with the band’s legendary “Let’s Groove” playing throughout the chambers.
“It is my great honor and privilege today to bring to this council and to this city, one of the greatest bands ever in the history of the United States, the one and only Earth, Wind &amp; Fire,” Councilmember Harris-Dawson states as he opens the ceremony.

The founder of EWF, the late Maurice White moved the band to Los Angeles early in their career. Phillip Bailey, Verdine White, and Ralph Johnson were in attendance to receive their honors Tuesday morning, along with their wives and a room full of fans.
“I cannot begin to tell you how special this moment is for me,” Johnson, a native and product of Los Angeles, shared, “it’s one thing to receive a proclamation in a city where you live, but to receive it in city where you were born and raised, I’m very proud of the fact I’m from Los Angeles, Califonia.”

Next year, the band will also be celebrating their 50th anniversary, Johnson adds, “I can think of no better way to start the celebration early.”
Both Bailey and White affirmed Johnson’s speech with much gratitude and enthusiasm for the upcoming events that followed. Councilmembers Curren D. Price, who went to school with Ralph Johnson in the youth, and Monica Rodriguez also shared remarks, thanking EWF for their contributions to fashion and music, and their ability to uplift the masses.
“There is no higher honor that we can give anybody, and I’m just proud to be apart of this council and helping to commemorate your great work and legacy,” Councilwoman Rodriguez said.
The group was given two proclamations, one that read “you’re awesome” and the other declaring September 21st as Earth, Wind &amp; Fire Day from this year on out.
September’s significance was also further explained by Johnson in a separate interview. “It’s a feel-good song, and September is always a great time of the year. You’re coming out of the summer and getting ready to go into the fall.” The legendary musicians and singers can now add their special day to reasons why this month is so extraordinary.
Denise Williams and actor, Craig Robinson were also in attendance at City Hall. Robinson shared EWF had been one of his favorite bands growing up due to their inspirational lyrics and feel-good sound.
Outside of the ceremony, fans waited for an opportunity to take photos with the group as well as a catered lunch from Comfort LA, and music curated by DJ Mona Lisa. Councilmember Harris-Dawson gave a final speech once out on the Spring Street Forecourt where the reception took place, noting EWF as the greatest band ever.
“Enjoy each other, enjoy Los Angeles, enjoy again, America’s greatest band, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire.”
