            A personal note...        About declawing.When a cat has a specific behavior issue, it’s important to get to the cause of that problem and deal with it. Either you remove the source of the stimulus that is causing the issue, or you help the cat grow accustomed to the stimulus.There’s a lot of areas where the “remove or get them used to it” plan of attack can get kinda muddy, but if you really boil down most cat issues that’s what it falls to, and there are different ways to deal with both.Except declawing.You know, it’s true. Not all cats who are declawed develop “behavior issues”, but when they do, it’s severe. And when they do, you don’t get a say in how you want to handle it. You don’t get the decision. Telling me you don’t want your cat to go on the counters is easy. I can train them not to. Heck, YOU can train them not to. It takes work but it’s doable. But if you tell me you want your cat to be able to walk on the linoleum floor instead of the carpet after you took off the tips of its toes, you don’t have that right. If you want a cat to go somewhere you’re going to have to put down a carpet for it to walk on.And this has nothing to do about blame. Public information has changed about declawing. A lot of vets refused to do it now. It’s illegal in some countries. I know plenty of amazing cat owners who have declawed cats in the past, who have learned the reality of the procedure, and have vowed to never declaw another cat.But once a cat is declawed, there is no amount of training that can help them. It’s all about doing what they want. Because they’re in pain. Because they’re scared. Because they have absolutely no defense.People declaw cats because they don’t want the cat to scratch them. Cats are more likely to use their only line of defense when provoked - biting, which tends to be WAY more severe. Cats who scratch don’t get put down. Cats that bite do. The lack of protection effects every single thing about their lives. How they interact with people. How they interact with other animals.A declawed cat will still try to scratch at scratching posts.That fact haunts me. The fact that scratching is so ingrained into a cat’s behavior that they will still try to scratch something even when they no longer have the ability to. Because not only does it feel good and help sharpen their (long gone) claws, but it’s also an incredibly important form of social interaction and scent mingling. Try talking to someone without your tongue and tell me how that goes.People declaw cats because they don’t want the cat to ruin their furniture. Declawed cats also tend to stop using their litter box because the litter feels like sandpaper against their painful toes. So when you have to throw away your fifth urine-drenched couch, be happy that at least the legs weren’t scratched up.People declaw cats for lots of reasons. But if that cat develops a problem (or two, or ten), you have to do everything you can make it better. No amount of encouraging them to use the litter box will work if using the litter box is physical torture. Or if they’re too scared to leave from under the bed because they have absolutely no way to defend themselves. You can’t give that back to them.I am powerless to help. I can give you suggestions that will make the cat’s life the best they can possibly have. But at the end of the day, it’s possible that your cat can’t use a litter box at all because they’re in too much pain. It’s possible that they’re going to keep spraying or marking not because they want to mark their territory but because they LITERALLY can’t do the thing that allows them to safely mark (scratching at a scratching post). I can’t really help you because I’m a Cat Behaviorist, and you’ve essentially made sure that you no longer have a cat.But y'know. At least they didn’t claw up your chair.

One of the details that gets lost in the transition of manga-to-anime for Fullmetal Alchemist, is the overt presence of foreign language. For example, the Xingese characters actually regularly speak Xingese amongst each other. While they aren’t the only example of foreign language being spoken, they are the most prominent.In the anime, every character no matter what race or what country they are from, speaks the same language as a translation convention. The only real hints that there are other languages present are very minor, like the fact that Ling wrote his message to Lan Fan completely in Kanji and that no one outside of them could read it. However, the manga has an interesting convention to denote that foreign language is being spoken, by giving every foreign language speech bubbles that are horizontal instead of vertical. This is lost slightly even when the manga gets translated because in Japanese, the vertical speech bubbles also have vertically typeset dialogue which help better distinguish the languages. Nonetheless, the speech bubble shapes are very distinct.When Ling talks to Ed, his speech bubbles are all verticalAs are Lan Fan’sBut look at Fu’s thought bubbles here and compare them to Paninya and Al’s vertical bubbles. They’re horizontal! Fu is shown to be thinking in his native tongue!Conversations that we heard all in one language in the anime, were supposed to be in Xingese.Like Ling, Lan Fan, and Fu on the roof.And Ling speaking with Mei at the end of the final battle.Its just one of those really neat details Arakawa uses that makes FMA’s world just a bit richer in the manga than what we see in the anime version of the series.

to-hurt-and-comfort-deactivated  asked:I'm a POC who writes mainly white characters but after seeing all the "diversity" posts on this site I'm wondering if I may be subconsciously prejudiced and now I don't know what to do. I feel like I've been doing everything wrong and yet I don't want to change my stories/characters to suit everyone else while not liking them myself.To Write (or not write) with DiversityNo one can force you to write inclusive stories. Inclusive meaning media that consists of marginalized people, because that is what diversity really is - including people who have always been right there, but have been purposefully left out and erased from the pages of books and scripts. Those who are, when finally represented, are overwhelmingly assigned small, unflattering, and / or stereotypical roles.Pages like Writing With Color are an offering. Our presence here is for those who choose to write with diversity. We aim to make being inclusive easier because we all believe in the importance of it. But as much as we know how enriching diversity can be, we cannot convince you to do something you don’t necessarily believe in.Don’t do it because you feel forcedAs you mentioned, you’ve read the posts. You know the facts. The decision cannot be forced upon you.  If anything, including diversity out of obligation alone could lead to bad representation. Forcing people to do things without motivation usually means it’ll lack effort, or be done with spite. Trust me when I say marginalized people don’t usually want to see themselves represented by someone who does not want them there. That unwelcome feeling shows. In short: Lack of representation hurts. Bad representation hurts worse. I only ask that you have accountability.  Now that you’re aware that your works default to white, you have a choice to make. I think a lot of us grew up reading and writing very white stories - both as PoC and white people - but once you possess the knowledge that things can be different, your next step is a conscious one. You’re not on auto-pilot anymore when you make everyone white (and/or straight, able-bodied, etc). You know better now. Own up to your choices.So ask yourself: why have I chosen to write without diversity?I’m afraid to write People of Color. Being uncomfortable writing People of Color is a big reason why people stick to writing white people, and only garnish their stories with PoC, if that. White people have long been the default, the everyman. White perspectives are “neutral” to approach. It’s daunting to go from feeling you can portray characters in whatever way you wish to suddenly having the weight of good versus harmful representation on your shoulders.You don’t want backlash from getting it wrong. You also don’t want to be insensitive to groups. It’s easy to avoid writing them altogether, right? Sure. Be aware, though: You’re making a choice to exclude people out of fear.Of course, new things are scary. But that’s okay! Courage is the ability to do things that frighten you. Face your fears. Will you shrink away from the challenge, or use it to your advantage?Let the fear fuel you to do better and to know better. Your concerns about writing PoC can drive you to get the research right in order to best represent people. If your fear is leading to more effort into thoughtful creation, you’re putting it to good use. Let me tell you right now - you will mess up. Maybe in small ways, perhaps in a big way. But mistakes will not kick start the apocalypse. Ideally:Do your research to avoid the most obvious and devastating mistakes from the jump.Equip yourself with the right beta-reader and sensitivity readers to catch those things. Even with errors, your story can be quite enjoyable for people who hardly see themselves represented. Yes, mistakes and all.As a Black woman bookworm, if you write an exciting story about a Black girl on adventures and falling in love but mention a few questionable things about how she takes care of her hair…I will wince, but it won’t ruin the book for me. I’m willing to overlook some things, for the sake of my enjoyment, and let the author know how I felt about those parts in hopes they can improve. Say you get something real important wrong. People call you out for it. I suggest you apologize, listen to their critiques, and do better. If possible, pull back the story and re-release when you’ve improved the piece. If that’s not an option, fix it in future works. Getting a finger wagged at you doesn’t mean lock up in fear and never write with diversity again. It means you improve.Research PoC like you would on any topic:For comparison’s sake, consider writing People of Color (or any group different from you) like writing other topics you’re unfamiliar with in-depth. For example: You may know the basics on Medieval England. The knights, royalty, and so on. But i’m sure there’s a lot of misconceptions mixed in there from television or unreliable sources. To write people from this perspective, you would do lots of additional research… right?  If someone mentioned how you messed up on some of the facts, you would take note and dig into it more for the future…right? You might even have more experienced persons check your facts for accuracy beforehand to do the best job possible.Approach researching PoC in the same way as other topics. There may not be hard facts on how to write an X character, but there are portrayals to avoid with explanations why, and roles people want to see themselves in. I don’t like to be told what to write. There’s this misconception that writing with diversity restricts creativity. I get it - there are things you’re being told not to do when writing certain groups. The lists of No’s can get dense. This reflects how poor representation has been for People of Color as there are a number of stereotypical portrayals folks are tired of seeing and has been detrimental to them. Fiction simply reflects real life: People of Color being viewed through the lens of preconceived notions means being written on with those stereotypes in mind. It is a vicious cycle. Stereotypes are more than an annoyance - they can and do lead to real life consequences.Being treated like a stereotype lowers our quality of life. Experiencing racism and daily microaggressions has a psychological effect - from insecurity, depression and PTSD - it is serious. (X)Viewing People of Color by their stereotypes is what makes, say, a Black person who speaks with passion no matter what it’s about (and even if they’ve been wronged) too hostile and “Angry” to take seriously. If anything, they’re now a serious threat. And that’s dangerous for them.Put yourself in the shoes of the overly typecast.Think of a time someone misunderstood you. You had a bad day and acted grumpy. Well, being a grump defines who you are now. When asked, people describe you as crabby and humorless. Every new person you meet sees your every action through that lens. Strangers tiptoe around you, as they can just tell you’re ill-tempered. Peers choose their words carefully, afraid of what might spark your wrath. Your children even inherit the title; teachers discipline them more and take other students’ word over theirs- your kids are snappy, difficult, and known to not play well with others, after all. 
Wouldn’t that get old? Wouldn’t you feel it was unfair to be reduced to a label, and that you’re sick of being defined by it? Wouldn’t you have the desire to be seen for who you truly are, and can be? Perhaps you do get grumpy sometimes, which is just being human. You’re so much more than a grouch.
Stereotypes are not creative. Writing outside of stereotypes open up so many more possibilities. How many times have we seen the Black Best Friend play out in media? You’re not being silenced when readers criticize your sassy sidekick. Your message has been heard, loud and clear - again and again and again. People are upset because it’s not anything new - in fact, it is quite old.  We want multiple portrayals. Why not create something new before you decide to write so closely to how we are always written?OP said: I don’t want to change my stories/characters to suit everyone else while not liking them myself.This should not be the case. Avoiding stereotypes has nothing to do with making unlikeable or even perfect characters. Simply make Characters of Color who go beyond stereotypes! Characters who are best friends without being arc-less doormats. Characters who are fierce and emotional and stand for something without being simplified to irrational, hostile, and angry. Knowing the difference between stereotype and culture is important, too. Don’t let anyone tell you you’re doing something wrong when their bias means they perceive your character as being stereotypical, or problematic, when they’re not. (See: Stereotyped vs Nuanced Characters and Audience Perception.)  If anything, writing beyond hard labels leads to complex characters. Writing about new cultures is interesting and can be exciting. If you only like your East Asian characters when they’re geniuses or your Black girls when they’re angry without a cause…do some self-reflection. Why do your Characters of Color only seem “right” to you when they are flat, or confined to stereotypes? Why not allow them to be complex humans?I’m not convinced that representation matters.Well, representation does matter. A lot. While it has been written on so much, and there being countless studies, statistics, and personal accounts to support this, I would like to mention…Representation (or lack thereof) lowers self-worth.Studies show TV boosts the self-esteem of white boys. The confidence of People of Color and girls of all races, on the other hand, decreases when watching TV (X X). “If you want to make a human being into a monster, deny them, at the cultural level, any reflection of themselves.” -Junot DiazThe Racial Empathy Gap.I want to be brief (too late, right?) so let me just mention another point of research for you: the racial empathy gap. Stereotyped depictions and the limited roles for People of Color are internalized by society, leading to lack of empathy towards People of Color and the enforcement of stereotypes in real time. Lack of empathy actively affects how PoC are treated, such as the belief that Black people experience less pain than others and therefore are misdiagnosed (their illnesses and pain are downplayed) and under treated (X X X). Fiction Increases Empathy.In addition to the racial empathy gap, look into the studies on how fiction improves empathy. For example: reading about vampires increases empathy towards vampires. Imagine what non-stereotyped, marginalized depictions in fiction can do for empathy.  (X, X)The strength in which people are against representation speaks volumes. If representation does not matter, then why are some people so angry when it’s there? Let’s take book to movie depictions: A Character of Color depicted as white simply means they were the best actor for the job, according to a vocal presence in social media. However, even a verified Character of Color being depicted as such leads to boycotting, accusations of being “Politically-correct”, and wide complaints that they can’t relate to the characters and they are poor actors. Never mind that so many Actors of Color attend prestigious schools only to get so far.The hypocrisy speaks to a need for more representation, and a prevalent lack of empathy. The People Want Diversity!On a positive note: shows that reflect the real world, aka include diversity, continue to get high ratings despite many obstacles: those who don’t want them there, lack of advertising or inconvenient airtime for shows with diverse leads, the ole bait-and-switch method, and hasty cancellations. Not to mention media simply refusing to be inclusive even when they know “diversity sells” (X X). Gee, I wonder why….
Audiences are more drawn to projects that feature a diverse cast, a new study finds, though mirroring the population in the United States remains a problem.
“Less-diverse product underperforms in the marketplace, and yet it still dominates,” said Ana-Christina Ramón, the report’s co-author and assistant director of the Bunche Center. “This makes no financial sense.” -Diversity in Hollywood Pays Off in Ratings and Box Office, New Study FindsDiversity simply reflects the real world accurately. There is nothing forced about diversity. People of Color exist in the real world, go out and about, and have lives. Creators including marginalized people only seems strange because media actively scratches them out as much as possible, pulling the marginalized out of focus to zoom in on white characters. That is what’s unrealistic. Ultimately, you, the writer, will write what you want. Just ask yourself why you have decided this is what you want to write. Are you okay with that reason? Despite all the progress that is being made, you’ll blend in just fine with all of the other mostly white books and movies out there. And as people become more conscious and bored with the same stories, we can and will choose to ignore whitewashed media. The good thing is that there’s so much awareness and activism going on with representation; the path has been paved for you and it is not lonely! There are resources out there, and WWC continues to be one of them.More Reading - Diversity:Braving Diversity: How to Write Yourself (and others) out of your Story  (An early WWC post quite relevant to you, OP)Diversity exists in the real world The Key to Moving Beyond checklisting is not LESS diversity Bad Representation vs Tokenism vs Diversity: just existing without justification like in the real worldHow to research your racially/ethnically diverse characters –Colette

Happy Birthday Jack!Short “comic” about Jacksepticeye! 💚↓ Same thingies I said on Instagram below ↓Well, this is kinda embarrassing but I’ve made a comic! A comic about @therealjacksepticeye. Today, 7th of February the Lil’ but loud (VERY LOUD) bean is aged 29. It’s funny that I haven’t been watching Seán’s channel for more than 1 or 2 years because at the beginning I watched Markiplier’s channel then both.It didn’t take me long to feel attached to people that weren’t even physically by my side, I really appreciate both, Mark and Jack, 2 special people that with their laughs and goofy personalities in their videos, made me smile a lot more than I used to and see the world brighter.I’ve met some people who speak Spanish and also love them and I’m grateful for that! JSE community is really the sanest that I’ve ever been into. Lots of beautiful and nice people ;v;, also, all the scepticart and edits make me feel better about being an artist, there are a lot of people who share the same likes as me! ♥️I think PMA has changed a lot of lives, mine included, I’ve always been a kind of realistic - negative person, but hearing Jack’s point of view of some stuff and saying encouraging things have made quite a great impact on my way of thinking.This may not be the best message he’ll read (or maybe this will get lost in better fanarts), but he has changed my life! I really mean it.And I wish him the best of the days because he deserves it! 💚✨I’m sorry if something I wrote is wrong or doesn’t have a correct grammatical order.I’m from Argentina and here we speak Spanish as our native language! 💚I’ve technically learnt English on my own and watching videos in English to boost my listening skills was the first step to join this awesome journey :D. Thanks to mostly Jack and Mark, I don’t struggle anymore with the typical Brittish guy they put on the cd player for us to get used to that weird accent (in a good sense of course xD).→ Here I have more space than on Instagram :O ←This isn’t on Instagram but I wanted to write it here at least.I’m sure that a lot of you won’t like it, why? Well of course because I have almost no clue about the egos backstory, canon or fanon concepts… I don’t really know.But I wanted to do this comic because I thought…“The egos seem to be part of Seán, it would be nice to draw all of them but how would they look like with Seán’s actual style (brown hair, more beard lol). Also, I want to draw him with his Mabel sweater because, why not.”Yeah, I’m really deep uvu. Are you moved because of my touching concept? You must be.I’ve seen Seán’s old videos and he was as nice as he is right now but louder. I don’t know why people keep saying that he has changed but in a bad way or something like that, I think he has improved and achieved a lot of good things!We’re proud of you BOY 💚.I want to write a lot more! But most of you I bet that are bored right now xD.So I’ll keep it for myself, for now, ovo/ 💚✨.Pd: I’d be VERY grateful if the few people that’ll see this, reposted it for others to see as well! This took me a lot of time and I was very anxious because I felt that I wouldn’t be able to finish it on time, but here I am, not the best drawing I’ve made but the first attempt to make a comic xD. It’d mean the world for me if Seán saw it! 💚 (I wrote all of this on the mobile version of Tumblr, but on the web site, lots of words have been replaced by emojis, wtf).¡Muchas gracias a todos los que hayan llegado hasta aquí! 💚💚Thank you very much for the people who have reached this part without dying from boredom 💚.

pleasespellchimerical  asked:Hey so there's a debate I've been having with myself. I'm a big proponent of Ship and Let Ship, Your Thing is Not My Thing and That's Ok, and DLDR. On the other hand, I have trouble when I see fan pieces that are obvs racist af. I feel like it's important to be actively anti-racist, and I don't know how to fit this into my fairly laissez-faire vision of fandom. How can calling out racist material fit nicely in with DLDR? Fandom can be a bad space for POC, and as a white person I wanna (1/2)
(2/2) actively work to make it better, but I’m not sure how to do so without overstepping my boundaries as someone who does have white privilege, and also not falling into an anti mindset. Would your thoughts and the thoughts of your readers on this. Thank you!-I’ll start my answer by saying I’m also white, so do with that what you will. Any time you see something you deem ‘problematic’ in a fanwork, you have three options. Say something to the author, say something to a friend, say nothing at all. I tend to choose on a case-by-case basis, myself. If I know the author, I’ll have a conversation with them in a message window. I start by asking questions and go from there. They might be using a racist trope without realizing it. Giving them some compassion while educating them on the issue tends to have a good result for me. Attacking and accusing tends to shut things down. If I don’t know the author, then I might comment. If I’m able to say something else about the story and if the issue is an easy fix. Once, I was really enjoying a fic but I noticed that a black man was the only character who called a white woman “Miss __”. I commented that I was enjoying the story and I asked if I was misremembering canon or if the author had a particular headcanon about it. They hadn’t even noticed they were doing it, and they immediately edited the fic. They’d just been trying to write him as polite and hadn’t realized the implications. If I don’t know the author and the change would require a large effort on their part then I’ll nope out of the fic and probably mention to fandom friends that the fic made me uncomfortable. If I’m reading in a fandom where I don’t know anyone else, then I won’t say anything at all. What about the rest of you? How would you handle this?

Witch Alphabet 🖋️Recently, I created my own alphabet to use in my practice. It was an interesting exercice, and I would like to share my process.I think most witches already saw at one point or another the Theban alphabet :I planned to use it at first, but found out it didn’t really fit what I needed : I’m a slow writer by hand, and the letters are pretty complex, so much that they’re more drawn than written.Why make your own alphabet?It depends on what you need, but there can be multiple reasons. You might want to have a way to make your craft more personal by having a writing only you understand. You might use it for your coven, so you can write things only for your group. You can use it to obfuscate the contents of your grimoire to anyone else reading it.How do you do that?There is more than one way to do that, but here is how I proceeded :	• Decide which language you want to base it on (if you speak more than one). This is an important step, because then it might work for that one language only, depending on how you make your alphabet. (On a side note, you can also make your own language, but I absolutely do not have the time nor the skill to explain that)	• Choose what you want to base it on. The first system you can think of is simply basing it on the alphabet of your first language, but it’s not the only option : you can also base it on sounds, concepts, or syllables depending on how complex you want it to be. For example, I based mine on french sounds, with the main letters being the consonnants and the vowels being accents. That makes a bit more letters than if I based it on the alphabet, but on the other side it feels more personal (and makes much more sense in my opinion. If I don’t want any exceptions then I don’t have to put any exceptions! Looking at you, french language!).	• Make a reference. Usually, that will be a table which you can fill with your letters. For example, I made a table with the consonants as rows and the vowels as columns, but it can be as simple as having a list of letters and writing the corresponding symbol next to it.	• Choose your symbols. That’s the trickiest part. For each letter you want to have, you need to come up with a symbol. I suggest to make them simple, with only a few lines, so they are quick to write. Just keep in mind that you might end up writing it fast when you know it by heart, so make sure the symbols are different enough from each other, but don’t hesitate to base some of them on each other (for example, since the sounds /p/, /t/, and /k/ are similar, I based their symbols on the same shape, and since they’re also similar to the group /b/, /d/ and /g/, I made those the same symbols but mirrored.) Also, don’t forget about punctuation!	• Optional : You might want to ask yourself if you really want it to be written from left to right then top to bottom. Maybe it would look better in another direction! For example, I noticed that mine could look nice if it was written from bottom to top first then from left to right.	• Test it out. Take a chunk of text, and write it with your alphabet. You will have to peak often at your letters at first, but it will come more and more naturally the more you write.	• Repeat the last two steps over if you notice there are things you should change (if a letter is too hard to write, if it clashes with the rest, …)And that’s it! The key after that is to keep using it regularly so you don’t lose it, and to make sur to also reread what you write to train yourself to read fast.

But why fanfiction?I got asked again recently why I write fanfiction and not ‘proper books’ (I’m pretty open about my fic writing, I’m not ashamed). I told them what I’ve told everyone else - I’ve done both and this is so much better. I self-published a YA novel a few years back, the plot of which I was super proud of, and I even have ideas for two sequels, but they’ll never see the light of day. I just have no motivation to write them, and world building is hard and that amount of effort just doesn’t seem worth it.See, everyone I knew wanted to read my novel, but no one wanted to buy it. Probably about 40 people read it but I only sold 16 copies, and for the effort to format text into a publishable format, the cost of ordering proof copies only to find it was wrong and to do it all again, and the stress of the whole process was just so not worth those few dollars that I made. But I knew going into it that I wasn’t going to be one of those fairy tale stories of an unknown author suddenly becoming a sensation overnight. The story was too obscure, set in Western Australia and wasn’t an ‘outback romance’ which is the only ones that seem to be popular in this setting. I’m more than okay with that because I have fanfiction now.The difference? I have thousands of people reading my stories, and not just reading them, but I get feedback from some of them (never enough, we authors are fickle creatures who always want more comments, more interacton, more discussion). The thing is though, fanfiction gives me an audience that I will never have from my YA novel. That audience already exists, it’s out there, and they’re hungry for the story to continue. Not all fanfiction is successful - the people who read it aren’t a mindless mass; they have expectations, standards, itches that need scratching. Quality matters, but not just the quality of the writing but of the idea. It’s not just formulaic bullshit that a ghost writer can churn out, change the names but the plot is the same and then throw a big name author on the cover and it’s instantly a bestseller. We’re forgiving of small mistakes if the plot makes us want to keep reading until dawn lights the horizon, we’ll salute the authors who write in English when it’s not their native language and will gladly offer help with those phrases that they’re not sure of, and best of all, we stick together to protect and support each other from annon hate so those ideas have a safe place to grow. We’re a community, a family.Fanfiction has also given me a platform to improve my writing. Looking back at the standard of my work at the very beginning (and even in my novel) I cringe now at how terrible it was. I’ve written over 1,200,000 words of fanfiction and I’m forever improving. I know how to properly punctuate dialogue tags now, my vocabulary has expanded, I’m not afraid to use adverbs just because some twat said ‘show, not tell’ is better. If an adverb makes the story flow better than three extra waffly sentences then I’ll damned well use it and be proud of it. I’m more confident in my writing and that shows in the quality. I would never have gained that confidence by selling fifty thousand books to ‘silent readers’. It’s the interaction, the feedback, the community that fanfic has that has made me a better writer.So that’s why I prefer to write fanfic over ‘proper books’ and I will fight anyone who says that we’re not real writers. At the end of the day, people read fiction to be entertained and if I can honestly say that thousands of people from all over the world have been entertained by my fanfiction, that makes me a real bloody writer.

when i say “i wish i lived in the 60s or 70s” , i do not mean “i wish i was born in the ‘good old days’ where sexism, racism and homophobia were the norm”. what i mean is “i wish i lived in a time period where there was hope for the future”, because with the leaders we have now, i feel hopeless.the 60s and 70s marked the uprising of political, sexual and musical liberation and revolution. the beatles; gay liberation; twiggy; civil rights movements; the pill for women etc.• the beatles were a pivotal band in the 60s that changed the way music was thought about. they blew up and they challenged every idea society had about rock groups. as well as the beatles there were; pink floyd who used their music to question the capitalist society we live in; the who, who advocated to black rights and poor people through their music; and david bowie who was a proud bisexual, gender bending, civil rights movement supporter person who used his platform to make sure teenagers knew that they were not alone• Gay marches and rights were talked about. people were finally believing in the existence of the LGBT+ community. stonewall occurred, marking the day gay people were fed up. books were written, movies were made and songs were written (e.g. lola by the kinks)• Twiggy killed the fashion industry and changed the way people expressed themself. she found power in clothes and portraying herself to the world the way she wanted: bold and powerful. twiggy challenged the way women felt about fashion and the clothes they were 'supposed’ to wear due to modesty • Black people stood up and were listened to (by some). the first black woman was portrayed on a television series playing a character other than a maid or slave (nichelle nichols in star trek). aboriginal voting rights were talked about and fought for in australia. the civil rights movement brought about: ruby nell bridges, martin luther king jr, ella baker• The pill was created and women sexuality was breaking out of the taboo. people were starting to learn that women are more than just stay at home mums, and that women were allowed to be what they wanted to beall of these events and people were pivotal in the change of the way things were. of course, it was far from perfect, but they started a conversation and a different way of thinking.teenagers were hopeful for a better future, they broke the mold, they questioned things that had never been questioned before. people wanted change and believed a better world was to come. of course, everyone associates me with the music of the 60s and 70s, and it is a huge part as to why i would have loved to live then. however it’s the revolutions and liberation that i also really love. i would have been fighting for all rights in several marches as well as been going to woodstock, monterey pop festival, and the isle of wight festival.so please, before you fucking say “'oh she just wants to go back to the 'good old days’”, just stop and fucking think about who you are referring to!! i’m a proud bisexual woman and an avid supporter for the BLM movement, and i would have been the same person back then.

anonymous asked:If you're still answering asks, can I ask how you color and render. I can do line art just fine but when I try to color it just doesn't work for me??? I know brushes don't matter but I don't know what I'm doing wrong Hey Anon! I totally feel you, to be honest I am in the exact same boat. I feel 150% confident with line art but once I have to go in for color, suddenly the whole drawing looks off. I’m not sure I can give you the advice you need since I don’t have any examples of your work and I am also not so great with color, but I can definitely give you some tips on what I’ve learned so far! &lt;3When I want to do a drawing with background I usually start out with a quick sketch of the overall composition, making sure it looks appealing enough. I keep in mind the local (natural) color of everything I sketched, such as clothes, hair, buildings etc. From there I try to figure out the lighting, such as: what is the light source and what direction is it coming from. The light is what affects the color palette of the scene, so it’s always important for me to figure that out first (unless I want the drawing to ignore light and shadow, then I’d only worry about picking appealing colors that sit well next to each other). I’ve blabbered about this before bahaha but I found that my coloring has improved after better understanding how color changes under the influence of different light sources. Using photo and real life references helps so much! Cold source light (blue, moonlight) = cold highlights and warmer shadows. Warm source light (orange, sunlight) = warm highlights and cooler shadows. Once I’ve sorted out the “temperature” of the light source, that’s when I go in and start blocking in the color based on both the object’s local color and where the light is hitting it and where shadows are created. This is done with an opaque brush though, because I don’t want the canvas to influence my color choice. After everything has been sketched in I start going in for cleanup and blending with a more transparent brush, which gives a softer transition between the light and shadow. The harsher the light, the less transition and the bigger the contrast. If it’s overcast, the shadows become very subdued and you’d want the colors to look a lot less saturated. Here’s a cup example of the color process with a strong warm and low light source:The last step I put more details, ditching some of the line art, and add in reflective light (blue) in the shadows from the surrounding environment. Sorry I was so long winded! It’s very hard to explain in words concisely how I color because it’s mostly a thought process haha… TL;DR study how light affects color in real life! Get comfortable picking colors you like. And brushes DO matter, coloring is so much easier with the right brush. They give you different textures that can make a real difference in a drawing. Experiment with lots and figure out which ones you enjoy using most!

I’m leaving-" "No, kitten, stay here,” he whines“Can you play with Kenma; he’s restless and the keyboard makes me fall asleep”He watches you play with Kenma as his substituteWhen he falls asleep, you quietly bid Kenma good-bye through the headset and log offKuroo looks like such a nerd sleeping Keeps fidgeting and snores - now you understand the bedhairYou kiss his forehead, giggling as you press his hair flat on his forehead and watch it poof up immediatelyKuroo gets better the next dayFirst thing he does is hop on the game server with KenmaHaving been converted by Kenma, you adore this game now“Kuro, I like playing with y/n more than you" "WHAT" "She never abandons me" "That’s right,” you chime in, tsk'ing“I WAS SICK”Ushijima WakatoshiUshijima rarely gets sickHe’s so cautious about maintaining his health; he lives a very regimented lifePerfectly measured portions, never overexerts himself during workouts and practices, always gets enough sleepThis one was inevitable though; everyone on the volleyball team got hit by the plague His father is abroad so he’s by himself You can’t pay attention in class all day, eyes drifting to the clock every ten seconds When the bell rings, you dash out the door and run all the way to Ushijima's home “Toshi!”“Y/n, why are you here?" "Toshi, I brought my humidifier for mucus and antibiotics!!" You make him stay on the couch with the humidifier blowing in his faceYou check his temperature for fever and make him gargle salt water for his throatAs you prep some herbal tea and vegetable egg soup, following a YouTube video, he watches you closely You make dinner, breakfast, and lunch for the next day, too  Gotta make sure this bear is well-fed &lt;3"Toshi, after you eat, you need to go to sleep.

anonymous asked:Could you maybe show us an evolution of your drawings? (Even before this blog?) I love the fact that you are self-taught. I'm not good at drawing but I would love to give it a go, but I would appreciate some motivation by seeing your evolution (if you don't mind)? Big fan! x Well, basically all digital art that I’ve drawn is posted on this blog, or at least on my dA account :) Although I did delete a few! So I guess I can bring them back… *cringe*Okay so… In 2015 I got really into Harry Potter and was inspired by all those fanartists, so I tried drawing some stuff of my own. I didn’t have a tablet yet, I was just trying the waters, seeing if digital art is even something I’d be interested in. Here are Hermione and Draco’s portraits I did in mid-November 2015 (I think I was drawing with my mouse, or I might have been using a touch pen on my Asus laptop that has a touch screen, but it’s very tough to work with, not like a tablet at all, no pressure sensitivity, no precision)Ugh the cringe…. :DI mean if you scroll to the very bottom of my dA page you’ll find more stuff like this, if you’re interested.But yeah, those portraits are pretty much the first digital drawings I’ve done.Continuing with portraits, 4 months later (mid-March 2016) I did Hermione and Draco again, this time already using my graphic tablet and also using references:Already much better! Yet, to me, still cringy :D I haven’t yet redrawin these portraits (I am planning to), but if we look at my newest portraits (from Ravenclaw set since that one’s the latest, it was completed in February 2017 which is almost a year later from the previous ones), you can see that I have improved a lot too!They look so much cleaner, every brushstroke has much more purpose, there’s more symmetry and logic and all those things. I like how my portraits changed, not sure how others feel :)The biggest change in my art was me starting to use references. It helps so much with getting proportions and perspective and body movements right.And then it was just all about continuing to learn and polishing my style through practice and frequent drawing :) As I did more and more portraits, it sort of felt as though I’ve always been doing them the same way, as though my portraits look the same and no progress is done, but as you can see, during one year, the way I draw changed, or rather got a bit better and precise, so while it didn’t feel as though I’m improving as I’m drawing, when looking back, the progress is visible.So just take your time :) Miracles won’t happen in a short period of time, especially if you don’t draw at least a couple of times a week (last year in spring-summer I drew like 5-12 drawings a week, so that totally made a difference). You will improve, I promise, but looking at other artists’ art, trying to figure out how they did it, trying out different tools, and learning from references will surely speed up the process of making progress. So yeah, I hope this helps a little :) Sorry I only showed portraits here, I just thought they’re good to show art evolution with since I drew so many of them. Good luck mate! &lt;3

strongindependentcheesecake  asked:Can we get a Patton with Dyscalculia?*slams fists on the table* YES. YES. YES. YES!Patton with DyscalculiaPatton goes through his whole childhood thinking that the numeral 4 and the word “four” are two separate things.Sometimes he misjudges the distance to something, sprints halfway to an ice cream truck, then promptly collapses when he realizes the truck is nearly a half-mile away.He loves to make 2 + 2 = *unreasonable number or object* jokes to strangers. (He can’t do it in front of teachers. They get upset.)Repeatedly has to measure out things when he wants to cook/bake.When Patton does bake, he might have Roman come in and double-check the measurements. Just in case.“Was that 50 grams… or 500? Roman? Stop laughing kiddo, I’m serious.”Patton struggles with being on-time to events. It’s not that he can’t read the clock, it’s just hard to remember schedules and keeping track of time.Patton went through a series of tutors through his elementary school years, but none of them stuck. They all thought he was pretending to not understand. (He had to repeat the third grade as a result.)When he got into high school, he was signed up for a learning disabilities class. There, he was tutored again, but the tutors were still a little baffled.Enter: Logan the peer tutor.Patton has a better grip on numerals and keeping them in context, but when it comes to actual calculations, he has to have Logan explain over and over again. (”That’s a multiplication symbol? Not a plus sign?”)Patton sits for hours with Logan, pouring over charts and examples in their textbooks until it starts to sink in.Logan can get frustrated when he tries to work around a problem with Patton. (You could also do it this way, Patton. “How?” I’m showing you. “But… what about the other way?” Patton…)Logan is the one to point out dyscalculia to Patton, his voice gentle and kind as he pointed out the similarity in Patton’s struggles. It’s like a light bulb going off in Patton’s mind. He feels a lot less stupid after that.They change their tutoring style after this revelation, and Patton’s math grades improved drastically. Patton makes sure to show Logan his grades after every test, treasuring the way Logan smiles and congratulates him.Patton + dyscalculia = a good boy. 💙

…………………………W H A TNow, we don’t have time to unpack ALL OF THAT, but—Cheery’s not non-binary, she’s a trans woman. That’s literally the entire point of her first character arc. And while I’m all for more NB rep in media, getting rid of trans rep to achieve it is not a good thing. And not something we should be patting people on the back for.I’m not sure…why Angua is suddenly more senior than Carrot, and I guess that’s the littlest, stupidest thing here to be complaining about, but… Unless they’re also changing the order of who makes captain first (Carrot by a long shot in the books), this has the potential to feel a hell of a lot like all those “competent woman who’s been doing this a lot longer than the random dude teaches him to take the job she’d be better at because he’s the Chosen One,” and, like. Carrot is the Chosen One! Kind of. But not like that. Anyway, I’d have to think about this a lot longer to hammer out why it’s getting on my nerves, and we so don’t have time for that, because–…………….WHOMSTYeah, no, legitimately, WHAT?First off, go Google Lara Rossi—I’ll wait. Back? Okay, so we’re all agreed that she’s young and thin and beautiful, right? And not, for instance, middle-aged and fat and plain? Yeah, I’ve got some problems with THAT.Secondly, she’s…what? She’s TAKEN TO VIGILANTISM? To combat CRIMES THE WATCH IS POWERLESS TO CHASE?Which fucking books were you reading, friend? They can’t be the ones I’ve got on my bookshelf.Why did you decide Sybil Ramkin wasn’t good enough as she was? That being kind and intelligent and passionate was boring? That a love of animals and the color pink made her an inadequate character? That she needed to be edgier and sexier?But I guess she’s a Hero of the People now——okay, but seriously, y’all, imagine what would Pratchett would’ve written about vigilante justice for a hot second. Yeah, just think about it. He would’ve made fun of that for days. Superheroes. Heroes. In Ankh-Morpork. Mm-hmm.…I mean, it’s not as bad as Sybil?I guess?But, I mean, he’s literally just an evil serial killer, so—So…Are…are you…are you trying to make the WATCH…dark and edgy?Oh, fuck, you ARE, oh my god, someone send help.

            “To Be” or Not “To Be”: What Exactly IS Passive Voice?        When giving writing advice, people will tell you to avoid “to be” verbs. This can be scary advice. We use “to be” verbs. A lot. So when is it okay to use “to be” verbs and when is it not? Usually when people say to avoid forms of “to be,” they are talking about examples like this: The dog was walked. Here, the dog is pretending to be the subject of your sentence. But what “was walked?” The dog. It’s actually the direct object. Your sentence has no subject. Who walked the dog? Is it a mystery? Why is it a mystery? Why are you keeping the dog walker from your reader? Obviously, Todd walked your dog. Make Todd the subject of your sentence. Give Todd the credit he deserves. Todd walked the damn dog. Active sentence.Not only is Passive Voice confusing, but sentences structured that way wind up wordier than when they’re restructured. The goal of writing is to be concise. Make your sentences as short as they can be without sacrificing style and substance.“To be” verbs also make for boring descriptions. For example: Todd’s teeth were white. His lips were red. Absolutely dull. [Insert “Okay…” side eye gif here.] This does nothing to make a character stand out in the mind of the reader. A better description: When Todd’s blood-soaked lips parted, they revealed gleaming white fangs. The use of “to be” verbs here is systemic of a larger problem: descriptions that take up more room on the page than their worth. The things we describe need to do more than just exist. (ie. being) Show them at work. Show what they’re doing in the story. What their purpose is. What they say about the character. However….I’ve seen people develop phobias of the words “is” and “was” over fear of using the dreaded Passive Voice. I’ve known people to mark every single “to be” verb on the page in workshops. But it’s okay to use “to be” verbs. I’ve already used well over a dozen in this blog post. When it’s cool to use “to be” verbs:When there are no other, better verb hidden in your sentence. Hint: almost all other verbs are both more interesting and more precise than “is.” When you actually do mean for Todd’s identity to be a mystery. Who walked the dog? Was it the same person who murdered Louise? We’ll never know. (It was definitely Todd.) When characters are being passive aggressive in dialogue: “What’s done is done. I’m not saying that Todd did it. I’m just saying: it has been done.” When the direct object is the focus of your sentence, even if it’s not the “actor.” In 2018, the dog was walked for the first time ever. Here, it’s not about Todd. Nobody gives a hoot whether or not Todd walked the dog. This sentence is about the dog. If you put Todd in there, the meaning of the sentence becomes confused: In 2018, Todd walked the dog for the first time ever. So did Louise walk the dog in 2017 or was this actually the dog’s first walk? Who knows?Progressive tenses. When you’re talking about a continuous action. ex. Todd is currently walking the dog. There’s no way to remove “to be” without changing the meaning of the sentence. There are more examples, but I’d hope by now you’re starting to get the larger picture. Basically: “to be” verbs are totally cool. Just make sure your sentences are clear, concise, and that you’re using the best verb for the action.

aspoonfuloflanguage  asked:Hey! So I recently got a new job and moved to a new city and don't get me wrong I'm very grateful... but ya girl's stressed, exhausted, and a little bit lonely. Do you have any advice and/or a funny story to help me through the week?last night, sam went upstate and took his little nieces and nephews out trick-or-treating. naturally, steve and nat and  i went with him, to help establish him as “The Coolest Uncle Ever: Even Better Than Uncle Terry, Who Is A Cool Cop And Always Smells Like Vanilla.” or at least, that’s why nat and steve went. i just went to heckle sam. (as an aside: the dawning realization that i experienced when sam’s sister’s kids came running at him, yelling “Uncle Sam! Uncle Sam!” was incredible. Uncle Sam hangs out with Captain America. perfect. )anyway, sam has–i think–six nieces and nephews. i think. they kept running around and it was hard to count. also, there may have been twins. i’m not sure about that–it may have been one child who kept changing costumes. it made me very grateful that i only ever had to look after steve and becca. the youngest of the little monsters was named seth. seth was three and a half, which he would proudly indicate with his pudgy little fingers whenever prompted. and sometimes without prompting. this was seth’s first halloween. as per sam’s family tradition, seth was decked out in a worn green dinosaur onesie, which came included with dino-face hood and very plush tail. every one of the kids wore it at some point, and after tessa’s (age 7) discovery that dinosaurs had feathers, it now includes a few dozen white feathers sewn onto the ends of the sleeves and tail. seth was delighted with this. he spent most of the pre-trick-or-treating time running around growling at people. when all the kids were ready to go, sam’s sister lined them up next to the door and dished out the rules: stay in a group, don’t leave anyone behind, don’t go into anyone’s house, etc. we adults were told that the kids were allowed to run along the sidewalks, but had to wait with an adult at the end of each block. when she’d gotten confirmations from the whole group, she opened the door and they went roaring out like a stampede of very tiny bison. we followed after. the group veered left right out the door. the house is in a suburb, nice and well lit and very safe, so we let them get a little distance on us. seth was at the back of the pack: his little dino-head tipped down for the charge, pudgy arms and legs pumping like a locomotive, tail like a rudder behind him. the rest of the kids charged up the next door neighbor’s driveway. head down, seth kept going.the rest of the group got their candy and bolted towards the next house, easily overtaking the little dino that could. unsure what was happening, steve and sam and nat and I waited at the end of the block. the oldest kids got to us first and compared their loot while we waited. seth pulled up soon after, having eliminated the going-up-to-houses stage and gained ground on the middle children. when he caught sight of the other kid’s candy, he was visibly confused. sam got down on his level and asked what was up. apparently, a misunderstanding had occurred. seth believed that halloween was a race, and the winners got bags full of candy. no one had actually explained the whole getting-candy-from-strangers part to him. seth was devastated that he’d missed a whole block’s worth of loot, so steve scooped him up piggyback and took off at a dead run, which is pretty impressive. i once saw steve outrun a horse. he and seth went full-out. by the time the rest of the kids had gathered with the rest of us, steve had re-done the whole block. and he only jumped three cars to do it in time. seth’s candy bag was rapidly filled by the neighbors, who managed to stop gaping long enough to extend their candy bowls. seth himself barely noticed, as he was too busy clinging to steve’s hair and shrieking. tessa was very jealous, and commandeered me as a steed for the next block. the rest of the kids quickly demanded the same from nat and sam. (sam’s “i do what he does, only slower” was not a great selling point for the kids, who wanted to go faster, sam.) so we spend the rest of the evening doing piggy-back halloween speedruns.seth got a lot of candy.You can find the corrected version of this post here on Ao3. -Mod Hell
