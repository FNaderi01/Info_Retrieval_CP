                                By Education Next

On Tuesday, January 16, 2018, AEI hosted a conference on the past two decades of school reform. Panels discussed what we have learned about accountability, policy instruments, and Washington’s role. The conference concluded with a panel on the lessons that can be learned about K-12 reform from the George W. Bush and Barack Obama years and then remarks by, and a discussion with, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.
For more on this topic please read “The End of the Bush-Obama Regulatory Approach to School Reform,” by Paul Peterson and “The Teacher Evaluation Revamp, In Hindsight,” by Chad Aldeman.
