                  Our Approach to Accessibility
                  We are committed to making accessibility a core consideration from the earliest stages of product design through release. Our central accessibility team has a mandate to monitor the state of accessibility of Google products and coordinate accessibility training, testing, and consulting. Product teams are offered training to help incorporate accessibility principles into the design and release of products. We also strive to cultivate relationships with a variety of users and advocacy groups to solicit feedback.
                      “When we say we want to build for everyone – we mean it. Accessibility is written into our mission statement and core to our values as a company. We don’t think a problem is solved until we’ve solved it for everyone. Technology’s great promise is to give everyone the same power to achieve their goals. As long as there are barriers for some, there’s still work to be done.”
                      — Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google
                  Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT)
                  To make it easier for companies, educational institutions, and government agencies to comply with accessibility standards, we provide transparent information about how our products currently work for people with disabilities. We offer the following Voluntary Product Accessibility Templates (VPAT). We'll continue to update this site as additional VPAT documentation is available.
