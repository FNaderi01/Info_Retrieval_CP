    Summary
      Reina takes great pleasure in teasing Kumiko, Asuka can't stop teasing them both, Kumiko can't string a sentence together, and Reina is her usual unflappable self. Basically thousands of words about them making out.

    No Archive Warnings ApplyAoba Moca/Mitake Ranfeaturing a few shenanigans from the rest of afterglow bc they're one big platonic fivesome soulmates a commission! the request was a mocaran confession so this is the story how they finally started dating after knowing each for their entire lives catalyst is ran getting a love letter in her locker from someone else in the school
    Summary
      Well— technically, they’re already engaged, she guesses. But the engagement party wasn’t exactly official. It was just five seven year olds in the playground, with a cake made out of damp second-layer sand lovingly clumped together and rings woven out of dandelions with stems that were slightly sticky from all the bending and squeezing. That’s the thing about childhood promises— they’re so warm with the sweetness of hazy remembrance that they taste just like dreams. They have the same ephemeral verisimilitude as well as the plausible deniability that comes with it.So, yeah, they’re not officially dating— yet. It’s really just a formality at this point. They’re soulmates, after all— they probably did something real nice in their past life, so this time around they get to meet early and have a lifelong fairy tale romance.
