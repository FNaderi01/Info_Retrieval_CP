    Summary
      Jungkook settles into his daily routine. School: full of his hyungs whom he cares for. Dance: which allows him to express himself in no other way. Food: that drives him to his porcelain throne, exalted but never in pleasure.

    Summary
      Edward Elric had one of the rarest Cores in the world, but no one could know that. Roy Mustang had one of the only Cores in the world that Ed could bond with, but he was a bastard with a god-complex. Now, because of said bastard and the military's insistence that the academy was important, they have to live together for two months. Ed had survived worse though... right?

    Summary
      “When Alec kneels before you on that dais, Magnus,” Jace keeps going, “he’s telling every person present that it is your judgement, your respect, that he places before all others. In you placing that rune on his neck, Alec is publicly proclaiming that it’s your blessing and your judgement on him and on his reign as Head that gives him the right and the authority to uphold the Covenant.”Magnus' throat is too tight to speak, but there’s a distinct shimmer visible in his suddenly unglamoured eyes.

    Summary
      A rogue alchemist, desperate to restore the alchemy of the famous Fullmetal Alchemist, pushes Truth into playing a new game - one that has Edward Elric waking up on the floor of his house where a transmuted abomination should have been, just in time to save his younger self and brother. He might have a chance to do everything again, now, though...He would never hold anything but bitterness for the title of 'dad,' but maybe an older brother could make things better.

    Summary
      Yuuri was almost sure that this was reality. His favorite tea blend could be found in the kitchen cabinet on left, and the teapot was on the top shelf, exactly as he favored. Two important thoughts went through his head. Could he even skate anymore, and more importantly, did any of the people he knew exist?

    Summary
      Whether it's real or not, Amy McManus finds herself in Thedas and severely limited by aphasia and suspicion. It's hard to warn people about the coming doom when you can't talk properly, and it's even worse when they might think you're the enemy. At the best, she's thought of as odd or addled, and at the worst she knows too much and could be dangerous. Honestly, what's a modern girl to do?
