You gathered your surroundings haphazardly, a subtle frown finding your lips as you realized that you had somehow slept through your entire lecture, the shuffle of students as they began to gather their things and slide out the lecture hall greeting you.“Morning, princess. Thought you’d never wake up.” The silvery voice of your best friend mocked.Turning towards Jungkook, you furthered your frown, a small sound of annoyance escaping you.“How did we end up with a verbal laxative as a professor?”The brown-haired boy let out an attractive laugh, reaching over as he began to pack his things.“He’s not that bad. This lecture was actually interesting – if you had only stayed awake long enough to notice.” He countered.You sighed, moving to mirror your best friend’s actions, “Ugh, sorry, sorry. I haven’t been sleeping much lately…” You threw your bag over your shoulder, making your way down and across the room, your loyal guard dog trailing closely behind you.You held back a snicker at your own thoughts.Although Jungkook had explicitly told you that he wasn’t fond of the dog comparison, it didn’t change the fact that he did keep you within arms reach at all times. You weren’t too fussed. You knew it was his alpha nature that couldn’t help but follow his omega best friend close. Keep reading

watermelon sugar || pjmthere were three things in your life you could never have planned for: 1) getting accidentally artificially inseminated as an adult virgin 2) finding out you’re pregnant with a celebrity’s baby and 3) falling in love with the guy too.═════════════════════🍉 pairing: idol!jimin x female reader🍉 word count: 13.3k🍉 genre: smut, fluff, romance, comedy🍉 warnings: handjob, fingering, oral (f), unprotected sex (she’s already pregnant lol) loss of virginity, multiple orgasms, creampie, pregnancy sex, impreg kink if you squint lmao and jimin putting the daddy in baby daddy ;)🍉 a/n: this can be read as part 21 of my social media au Kiwi or as a very bizarre oneshot ahsjdkdk i don’t know how this ended up so long but i hope y’all enjoy this filthy fluff xPREV || NEXT || MASTERLIST═════════════════════They say that fate is a funny thing. Not funny ha-ha, but funny in that you can never expect the things it’ll throw at you. (Although in your case, some of the things fate had sent your way could be considered kind of hilarious, in hindsight.) Honestly, you used to not be sure if you even believed in fate, but there comes a point when the things that happen to oneself seem too beautifully ironic to be mere coincidence, and you’d reached that point.Was it fate that that perfect building on the corner came up for sale right when you were looking for a place to open your coffee shop? Was it fate that you and Park Jimin visited that same clinic on the same day? And, most importantly, was it fate that out of all the women in the world to be accidentally artificially inseminated and wind up pregnant with his baby, it was your virgin self?No, that last sentence was not a joke and you absolutely wished it was.Somehow, either by providence, medical malpractice, or the beauty of human error, (or some unfathomable combination of all three) your simple check-up with the gynecologist all those months ago had resulted in you being mistakenly artificially inseminated with a sample from a man you had never even met. And as if all of that wasn’t insane enough on its own, to top it all off, you also happened to be a virgin. And now you were pregnant. You were a pregnant virgin.Like they say, fate is a funny thing, and in your case, it was fucking hilarious. Keep reading

            With You        Pairing: Jeon Jeongguk x ReaderGenre: Fluff, smut, College!AU, established relationshipWord Count: 5.2kSummary: Although trying to fight it, Jeongguk can’t help but become insecure about your relationship after your ex best friend starts filling his head with lies about you and Taehyung, his best friend who you just so happened to be out with that day. Good thing is, you’re right there with him to reassure him you want him and only him.—Alternatively, the one in which during a heated make out session you find out your boyfriend is a virgin, and decide to help him get himself off.Warnings: Heavy making out, light body touching (?), dry humping, confident Guk and shy/awkward Guk keep switching places, handjob, blowjob. And yup, Guk’s (still) a virgin.A/N: Helloo, this from part 28 of my Social Media AU ‘Tiger Flower’, but I guess you can still read it if you haven’t read the full story lol. So this was supposed to be a 2k drabble like the ones I always write but I got a bit carried away 🤡 I hope you enjoy! 💕 ALSO, someone asked me to bold the beginning and ending of the smut part(s), so if you don’t wanna read the smut just look for the bolded words and skip what’s in between lol.Running his hands through his face as the elevator’s doors opened, Jeongguk started walking through the hallway to his place, head lowered as he absently looked in his pocket for the keys to the apartment.The conversation he had with Sooyeon was still going through his mind over and over. Although he had managed to sound confident enough through the texts they had exchanged and he had put her in her place —along with blocking her ass just like he had wanted to ever since the first time she brought you up into the conversation—, he could not deny her words did hit home.Taehyung was definition of your type. Outgoing, talkative, funny, handsome. The life of the party, in other words. Something he was not, and something he would never be, considering he did not show up to parties at all if it wasn’t because he was either forced to by his friends or because you would be there.Taehyung could most definitely show you a good time, whereas he, on the other hand…No, fuck that. You were dating him. He was your boyfriend. He, Jeon Jeongguk. That was all he could find comfort in.Then again, you were not with him right then. You were somewhere else with Taehyung. As friends, but still. And then again, just like he had a high school crush on you and found himself falling all over again three years into college, so had you with Taehyung right before dating him. Would it really be that hard for you to fall for him a third time when the two of you were still so close?He shook his head, as if trying to shake his thoughts away. Don’t let Sooyeon get to you, Y/N’s with you for a reason. Don’t let Sooyeon get t—“Hey…”Before his head could keep on torturing him, your voice brought him back out of his small trance, fixing his wide doe eyes on you for two seconds before he took in his surroundings, only then realising he had already reached his apartment’s door.Staring back at you, his eyes lit up.

You can smell it in the air and feel the damp chill against your skin, permeating through every layer of your clothing. The surrounding forest and all its occupants seem to be collectively holding their breath, waiting for the first drops to come. Even your footsteps, soft as they are against the loamy earth, sound much too loud in the hush that’s fallen. Dark clouds gather overhead, looming like an omen, and you silently reach into your purse to check that the umbrella you’d stowed this morning is still there. Vaguely, you wonder if it’s big enough for two.  Keep reading

            easy || jungkook angst/fluff        Originally posted by ariescults-movedSummary: Date you, win a bet, get his rent paid off. Sounds promising enough, right? Jungkook should’ve known that his ambitions would end in disaster, but even if he did, that still wouldn’t have stopped him from pursuing you.Warning: cursing, crude humor, fuckboy talkGenre: college!au, fuckboy!au, bet!trope, angst, fluffPairing: Jungkook x female!readerPremise: In which Jungkook accepts a bet from Taehyung to date the first girl that walks into the lecture hall and realizes that he bit off more than he could chew when starts to catch feelings. Now, he has to suffer the consequences of being an idiot.Commission Request: @altus-gens​Word Count: 9,203 words—It’s not like Jungkook planned to be one of the most sought after person in Yonsei University, but it somehow turned out to be that way. Truthfully, he basks in it, loves that so many people idolize him for doing the bare minimum. He was handsome after all and had a level of charm that surpassed the need to have a good personality. He got into such a prestigious school through an athletic scholarship for Taekwondo, managed to convince his professors to pass him when he put in minimal effort, and there was no shortage of girls to call when he was feeling lonely for a night. He was the stereotypical ‘it’ boy on campus and maybe if he was a little bit smarter, he’d have a better choice of friends than the six idiots he always hangs around with.“How about this,” Taehyung starts, gum in his mouth, “the first girl who walks in, you have to successfully get in her pants.”Jungkook rolls his eyes. They were in a damn lecture hall and yet Taehyung had no shame bringing up sex. Typical.“This again, bro?” Hoseok sighed. “Aren’t you sick of bribing us to do weird shit for you?”Taehyung smirked.“Not at all, actually.”“For how much?” Namjoon cut in, probably curious for the price point Taehyung would arrange this time. He was fired from his job just a week ago and could really use the money. “I’ll do it if it’s enough to pay for my rent this month.”Taehyung scoffs, although knowing full well he could pay for all of the boys’ tuitions combined if he wanted to. He was the resident rich bachelor on campus after all.“I’ll pay it for a full year and your utility bills too if you’re really down,” Taehyung flaunts. “You just gotta have proof you actually managed to do it.”“Dude that’s gross,” Seokjin chimes in, “No one wants to send you proof of us doing it with a random girl.”Taehyung shakes his head.“No, no, no,” he says, clicking his tongue. “I phrased it incorrectly. I’m not a fucking pervert.”“You got us fooled,” Jimin mutters. Taehyung leans in closer to the six boys and even Jungkook finds himself getting intrigued. Admittedly, he was a little curious considering he hasn’t had a proper meal in weeks. He could really use having some extra cash for food without worrying about rent.“You have to date the girl for like three months,” Taehyung says seriously, “and I’ll consider that as enough proof that you managed to actually do it since I know you guys are too horny to wait any longer than that to fuck.”They all look at Taehyung in disgust, Jimin even opting to hit him in the back of the head for being so vulgar. To be fair, they were all thinking of accepting Taehyung’s bet regardless. It’s not like they were new to leading girls on anyway.“You gotta pay me more than that to fuck just any girl,” Yoongi says, yawning in the process. He seemed the least likely to take up Taehyung’s offer, but he was still game depending on the person.“Then how would you feel,” Taehyung starts, “if I told you guys that I could get you priority registration for next quarter.”The boys, even the ones who weren’t interested, were now listening to Taehyung’s every word.“You mean,” Hoseok gulps, “I could finally get that fucking Organic Chemistry class I need to get out of this hell hole?!”Taehyung shrugs, an ominous smile on his face.“Just the perk of having parents who have connections,” Taehyung replies. “I’ll only accept one of you guys to do it though. I don’t wanna have you all fucking the same girl- that’d be weird.”Hoseok rolls his eyes.“Yeah, that’s what’s weird about this,” he grumbles.“So are you guys in or not?” Taehyung asks, his patience growing thin.He lays back on his chair, a smoldering look on his face when they all nod. They were desperate for money after all.“The next girl that walks in will be the subject of this bet and whoever calls dibs on her first will be the one to woo her,” he says with a stretch of his arms. “Good luck boys.”They all turned to look at the door and Jungkook watches silently as guy after guy walks into the lecture hall. No girl yet. Jungkook was hoping, from the bottom of his heart, that no familiar faces would walk in. If he had to deal with a past fling, he’d have to back out immediately. He never dealt with exes very well.The guys are at the edge of their seats, praying for a cute girl to walk through that didn’t already know about their horrible reputation. They were looking for an easy target, someone that could fall for their charms almost immediately. And then, you walk in. You were clad in sweats with earphones on, rushing toward the front row seats of the lecture hall. You were chatting with your friends, yawning several times throughout your conversation with them. Jungkook couldn’t help but smirk. There was nothing special about you to point out, in fact, you were just like everyone else. Strangely enough, he found that the most intriguing part about you."Nope, nope, nope,” Jimin shakes his head repeatedly. “Can’t, won’t, never will. Sorry, Tae.”They all stare at him in confusion.“What the fuck, what’s wrong with her?” Yoongi asks, crossing his arms over his chest. Jimin faces away from you, not wanting to look at you any longer.“No, nothing,” there seems to be a blush forming on his face. He was hiding something.“Bullshit,” Taehyung furrows his brows. “Bro, if she’s crazy and one of us gets our dick bitten off, we’re all blaming you, so spit it out.”Jimin just sighs.“She’s been giving me Professor Kwon’s notes for the past few weeks,” he starts, much to the confusion of his friends. “Her name is [Y/N]. It’ll be really mean if I go after her, especially since she and I are kind of friends. Plus, I really need to pass this class. I failed last quarter…”The boys groan. Jimin was no fun.“She’s not my type so I don’t think I could really get into it either,” Seokjin states, no longer interested in the prize after Jimin’s confession. He’s been banking off of your notes from him too. “Aren’t we all old enough to know not to mess with people’s feelings?” Hoseok sighs.They roll their eyes at Hoseok’s statement. Who was he trying to fool with the nice guy act? He probably fooled around with girls just as much as the other guys did.“Yeah, I’m backing out,” Yoongi agrees, “and she hates me so there’s that.”They all look at him questioningly and he puts his hands up in the air from their gazes.“What? I just realized who she’s talking to down there.”He pointed at a girl discreetly, but no one seemed to recognize her.“Her friend and I dated,” Yoongi continues, “and I broke up with her over text and blocked her without letting her respond. That whole friend group is pretty much pissed at me. I’d rather not have to deal with them again.”The guys look disapprovingly at him. Breaking up over text was harsh, but probably not the worst thing Yoongi has done to his exes.“You’re actually a piece of shit,” Namjoon sighs. "I really do need my rent paid though…“Jungkook nods in agreement. It’s been almost impossible to balance Taekwondo practices, college papers, and working a part-time job all at once. If he could somehow find a way to quit his job for a while and get priority registration for classes, then he doesn’t mind getting his hands a little dirty in the process. Plus, you were cute enough and he’s sure you weren’t too difficult to befriend as long as he doesn’t mention Yoongi in any conversations."I’m in,” Jungkook chides, finally saying something after such a long period of silence. They all look at him with disbelief in their eyes. Jungkook was never the one to partake in Taehyung’s bets. In fact, he was the one usually ridiculing them for participating. He must have been really desperate if he was willing to do it.“I mean, it’s all yours if you want,” Namjoon replies, “I don’t wanna turn it into a competition.”“Don’t worry dude,” Jungkook fist bumps Namjoon, “I’ll quit my job and refer you for it.”They nod at each other as if they were on the same wavelength. “I knew I could rely on you,” Namjoon says, faking tears from his eyes. The boys groan in response.“Alright,” Taehyung claps his hands. “In exchange for providing me some mindless entertainment and going out with [Y/N], you will get your rent paid for the rest of the year and get early registration for next quarter. Sounds like a pretty sweet deal to me.”Jimin shakes his head.“I don’t know about this, guys…”Jungkook doesn’t hear him and instead takes one last look at you. You catch him in the corner of your eye and you can’t help but feel flustered at his serious expression. “Should be easy enough,” he mutters to himself and turns his gaze back onto his friend.“So we have a deal?” Taehyung asks.He smirks, shaking the outreached hand Taehyung held out for him. He steals another glance at you and he finds you staring right back. He gives you a wink.“Deal.” Keep reading

            Tonight | Min Yoongi III {M}        Moonlit Throne chapter one. 650words.contains: daechwita au, historical au, exhibitionism, brief mention of battle/deathtonight, the doors to the royal
chambers fly open with a furious slam as you sink your wet heat onto your king,
taking all of him in a single, ambitious stroke. the dark eyes that behold you
are coolly intense as he flings aside the dyed silk that preserved the last of
your modesty. but your hips stutter down to stillness when two court advisors
stumble inside, poorly averting their gazes.“please forgive our intrusion,
but–”“did i tell you to stop?” his stare bores into you regardless of
the men; the pressure from the spread hand on your thigh tightens in silent
command to move. to fuck. Keep reading

Your grandmother had always left her front door cracked open for as long as you could remember – you’d imagine to some that might have been strange, but in a town as small as yours, that was just the way it went. Neighbors knew each other intimately, their parents and their parents’ parents having grown up together for as long as memory could stretch back.From peaking inside, you could tell not much had changed about your grandmother’s home from when you left town. The same green floral wallpaper was stretching across the living room that you had grown up with. You remembered how you used to run down the halls playing pretend, the walls serving as a forest of green and white columns serving as trees for every one of your adventures.How far you dreamed of traveling even at a young age, wanting more than your small town could offer.“Come in, darling! I’ll be out in a moment,” You heard the familiar voice call out from somewhere in the kitchen, an ache in your chest echoing.Clutching at the strap over your shoulder, you reentered your childhood home for the first time in years, holding your breath as if a sudden exhale would send it crumbling down on top of you.“How can I help–”You watched as your grandmother made her way into the living room, her friendly smile dropping the moment she laid eyes on you. For a moment, no one said a word, the two family members standing across from each other silently, neither wanting to be the first to speak.It was you, ultimately, who broke the silence.“I’m sorry.” You began, eyes welling as they mirrored your grandmother’s.“How could you?” She breathed, disbelief dripping off of every word.
