Triple Billion dashboard

Tracking the work of WHO, countries, regions and partners to meet the Triple Billion targets and health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The Triple Billion targets are an ambitious initiative to improve the health of billions of people by 2023. They are the foundation of WHO’s Thirteenth General Programme of Work (GPW 13) acting as both a measurement and a policy strategy.
They are an integral part of the GPW 13’s Results Framework, a new tool designed to measure and improve WHO’s impact on health at the country level. Measurement of these targets is closely aligned with those of the Sustainable Development
    Goals, to reduce country burden in data collection and streamline efforts to accelerate progress towards achieving key targets.
