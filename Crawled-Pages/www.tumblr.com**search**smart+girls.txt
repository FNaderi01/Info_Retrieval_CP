Smart girls are the over thinkers, the insecure ones, the different ones. They know what the real world is like. They analyze every little thing in life. Why? To avoid getting hurt. To find happiness. They stay up at night trying to think about every possible situation to get through all the problems. They think too much, they trust less people. Their insecurity proves their respect towards themselves. Smart girls know their worth, now that‚Äôs the ones worth keeping by your side.

nytimes.comOpinion | I‚Äôm 10. And I Want Girls to Raise Their Hands.I noticed that boys in my classes always seem more confident. That‚Äôs why my Girl Scout troop created a new patch.By Alice Paul TapperLast year on a fourth-grade field trip, I noticed that all the boys stood in the front and raised their hands while most of the girls politely stayed in the back and were quiet. It made me upset.On the car ride home I told my mom about what happened. We talked about how it seemed unfair and how boys and girls should be equal. My mom talks to me a lot about women‚Äôs rights and how women are treated differently.I told my mom that I thought girls weren‚Äôt raising their hands because they were afraid that the answer was going to be wrong and that they would be embarrassed. I also think they were being quiet because the boys already had the teacher‚Äôs attention, and they worried they might not be able to get it. My mom and I decided that we should take the experience to my Girl Scout troop.We talked about it as a troop. All 12 girls in our troop said this was a problem they also noticed and we talked about how we could improve it. I suggested that we create a Girl Scout patch that would encourage girls to raise their hands in class and be more confident about using our voices. The other girls loved the idea, and they had other suggestions. As a troop we decided to go the local council, Girl Scouts Nation‚Äôs Capital, which represents more than 62,000 girls in the Greater Washington, D.C., region, to present our idea.We decided to call it the Raise Your Hand patch. Its message is that girls should have confidence, step up and become leaders by raising our hands.

            I'm here for my smart girls.        I‚Äôm here for the smart girls that society finds annoying.I‚Äôm here for the smart girls who heard groans from the boys when they got a certificate in assembly.I‚Äôm here for the smart girls that poured their souls into school and academics because it‚Äôs the only thing they felt capable of doing.I‚Äôm here for the smart girls who use their studies to hide their insecurities, those who focus on school to try and blot out the problems in their lives.I‚Äôm here for the smart girls that are treated as annoying for doing well, whilst the smart boys are encouraged to be proud of their achievements. I‚Äôm here for the smart girls who didn‚Äôt want to tell their lab partner what they got on the test, because they knew the boys would scoff and make remarks.I‚Äôm here for the smart girls who cried themselves to sleep because nothing they did would ever be good enough for society.I‚Äôm here for the smart girls that told society to go fuck themselves and fought their way out of their struggles and went on to do something amazing.I‚Äôm here for all the smart girls that didn‚Äôt make it into the history books or science journals.I‚Äôm here for the smart girls. We‚Äôre not going to take your shit any longer.
