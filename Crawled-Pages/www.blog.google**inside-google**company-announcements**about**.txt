      About the Keyword

      Published Sep 28, 2016

          Welcome to the Keyword — our new, central destination for the latest news updates and stories from inside Google.Google first began blogging back in 2004 — when mobile phones looked like this and before anyone had dreamed up Chrome, Android, or YouTube. Since then the company has changed a lot, and we’ve published thousands of posts across a large number of blogs.We wanted to make it easier for you to find Google’s official word on any given topic. That’s why we created the Keyword.The Keyword consolidates and replaces 19 of our existing official blogs, in English. Over time we plan to expand to include other languages, countries and more. And we’ll be retaining a bunch of our existing blogs for more specific audiences (such as our advertising and developer-facing blogs).The Keyword is designed to grow and change as we do, so as we introduce new products and technologies they can find a home here. It will guide you to the big news of the week while leaving room for smaller, fun updates from that afternoon. And everything comes with bigger, more beautiful images, videos and slideshows.If you were a loyal follower of an existing blog, don’t worry. We’ve made sure you can still dig in on a particular topic, and all your old bookmarks and feeds will redirect.Where you’re from is an important part of who you are, and the name “The Keyword” is a nod to the origins of search. Keywords also unlock information, which is what we’re hoping to do here — provide a central, official source of news about who we are, what we do, and what we value. (Plus, we like that it has “word” in it.)We hope the Keyword will let us bring you more stories and tell them in more ways. Thank you for reading!
