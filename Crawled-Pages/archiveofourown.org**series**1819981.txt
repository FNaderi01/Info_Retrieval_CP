    Summary
      The life was... not terrible. Yes Checkerface's plan worked and they got cursed but her preciouss House helped them tweak the Curse so that they would be in their adult form and that the Curse would not kill them... The official Sky Arcobaleno kept her distance from them and they were free to live as they want.She was content with her lot in life. Then one day Fon comes for help...AU from the Teeth and Claws series.Crossposted from FF.net
