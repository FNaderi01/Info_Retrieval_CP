Charger Girls Bring Open-Call Auditions to the South Bay            
				By Sentinel News Service                
	                	                Published May 11, 2018
		On Sunday, May 20, hundreds of talented dancers will once again compete for a coveted spot on the world-renowned Charger Girls, one of professional sports’ most respected cheer and dance teams. Most notable among the 2018 season’s highlights, this year’s squad will have the rare opportunity to perform on an international stage when the Chargers host the Tennessee Titans at Wembley Stadium in London on Oct. 21.
The FREE open-call audition will be held at Bay Club South Bay in El Segundo, Calif. Registration and check-in begin at 10 a.m. followed by the preliminary dance audition at 11 a.m.
“As much as we’re looking for the most talented and energetic dancers, we’re also looking for individuals who exemplify great character and have a passion for their community,” Charger Girls Director Lisa Simmons said. “Those making the 2018 squad will have a tremendous opportunity in front of them. Not only will they perform and be ambassadors for the organization in the Los Angeles community, they will be representing the Chargers on the world stage in London this October. This is definitely an exciting year to be a Charger Girl.”
        ADVERTISEMENT        
Applications are available only online at LACHARGERGIRLS. Applicants must be 18 or older by May 20, 2018.  Dancers are encouraged to send a 5×7 (or larger) head shot and/or full-body shot with their application. Walk-ups will be accepted at the door.
From the hundreds of dancers expected at the audition, at least 60 finalists will be selected. Each finalist will go through a one-on-one interview May 21-22, and a comprehensive panel interview on May 23. The final dance audition is scheduled on May 24. The L.A. Charger Girls will be announced on Chargers.com on May 25.
The Charger Girls will perform at all home games at StubHub Center and serve as ambassadors for the organization at business, community and charity events. The Make-a-Wish Foundation, Wounded Warriors, American Diabetes Association and D.A.R.E. are among the many non-profit organizations which have benefited from the Charger Girls’ support.
The Charger Girls were formed in 1990 and are recognized as one of the premier dance teams in the National Football League. They have performed at the Super Bowl and internationally in Berlin, Germany; Tokyo, Japan; and Sydney, Australia.
