how to deal with a witchy burnoutmost of us have been there. we lose our touch with the craft and don’t feel like doing much. we feel too tired and exhausted to put effort in it and sometimes we feels like there’s no point.here are some tips on how to get out of this sticky situation! 🌙drink tea ✨yes, you heard me! drinking teas with specific herbs (like chamomile for sleep, lavender for anxiety, etc.) will help you get in tune with herbal magick. you can also stir your tea clockwise to bring forward something (like good energy or calmness) or add a sigil on the bottom with some honey (doesn’t have to be perfect). 🍵✨🌸nature walk ✨get in tune with those energies outside! i always find a walk on the grass helps pick up my mood (especially barefoot!!). envision the energies from the earth flowing into your body 🌱🌎🍃witchy movie ✨sometimes, we just need a little inspo to bring us back to our craft. watching witchy movies can bring back that spark into us! some great movies i recommend are:the crafthocus pocusthe love witchpractical magiccharmed (a show)carriethe vampire diaries (a show)tarot ✨start off with one card if more than that feels like it would tire you. it’s ok! you can do one in the morning by asking a simple question like “what should i focus on today?” 🔮✨💜food ✨incorporate some magick into the food you eat! this isn’t hard at all, especially since we all eat food everyday. simply add an intent to an herb or spice and then add it into your food. for example, add cinnamon onto your oatmeal, with your intent being that you will have abundance 🥐🍦🍩songs ✨songs are great to get you back into magick! listen to pagan music, celtic songs, or just look up “witchcraft songs,” “wiccan songs,” or “pagan songs” on spotify🌛🤍🌜gratitude ✨this one’s real simple! when you wake up, thank the universe that you got to live to see another day. you can even journal it. breathe in the air and think of how grateful you are that you’re able to do that. soak in the sun’s rays and feel the heat. 🌞🌼💛final words…it’s ok to take breaks! nothing wrong with that. it’s human. appreciate yourself as a person. remember, you are magickal and divine no matter how many burnouts you have. burnouts happen to nearly everyone and it’s completely normal! 🍄🐥🌈sendin good vibez 💜

Things to Research Before Working with the FaeOriginally posted by gajo1987Research is the most important thing to do before heading into Faery work and witchcraft. You want to have a lot of in depth and versatile knowledge covering many areas of the topic so you’ll be able to understand and interact with the Fair Folk! If you don’t want to work with the Fair Folk you can use this list to help yourself understand them and take the proper measure if you ever stumble upon them. I know the list could go on forever but I’m compiling the topics I find build a good foundation of understanding. I have compiled this list to give those interested guidance and a push in the right direction, it is best you do your own research before asking other’s personal knowledge and opinions!!The BasicsTerminology ( Fae, faery, fairy, changeling, seelie, unseelie, sidhe, etc)The Origins of the Fae (Tuatha de Dannan, Aos Sí, Tylwyth Teg)Faeries in Different Cultures: Celtic (Irish, Scottish, Gaulish, French), Norse, Influences from Greek and Roman culture.Folklore &amp; Myths!! ex. Oisin and Tír na nÓg , Fenian Cycle, Arthurian Legend. Celtic Gods, Goddesses &amp; Heroes- strong influences and connections to the FaeTypes of Faeries (study diverse types from pixies,brownies, pooka to Kelpies, Bwbach and Red caps) *Make sure you can at least answer who, what and where about them.The Otherworlds (Tir na Nog, Caer Arianrhod, Annwn, Alfheim, Svartalfheim, etc.)Faery Landmarks (fairy tree, fairy ring, fairy hill)Signs of the FaeSacred Trees and Plants (Hawthorn) Protection!! very important*Bonus if you learn Celtic CultureGetting into Working with ThemConnecting to Nature and the LandHow to Banish Faeries &amp; Protect yourself, house, family, etc.Faery Behaviour and Proper EtiquetteProper Offerings, How to give an OfferingAnimals associated with the Fair Folk and Why? (raven, deer, etc)Faery Festivals and Holidays (Samhain, Midsummer, Beltane)Why certain things offend them- iron, saying “thank you”,etc.The Courts (Seelie, Unseelie, trooping fairies, solitary)Setting up a Faery AltarHow to work with them in Rituals Faery Flowers, herbs and crystalsA proper and personal way to communicate with them!!this means developing psychic ability, tarot, meditation, signs, etc.Hagstones, heptagram/faery starSome Good Books :) The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries, by W. Y. Evans Wentz  Encyclopedia of Spirits by Judika Illes Enchantment of the Faerie Realm by Ted Andrews Faery Craft by Morgan Daimler Celtic Mythology: Tales of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes by Phillip Freeman**if you have more topics, books or anything else feel free to add some!

Beltane☀️🔥Originally posted by thewitchesofthewoodsWhat is Beltane? Beltane is celebrated on May 1st although some people choose to celebrate it from April 30th to May 1st. Beltane is a day for fun, light-hearted celebration, love, and it is often represented by maypole dancing and performing fire rituals to honor the Mother Goddess and Sun God. The days are getting longer and all life is bursting with potent fertility and sexuality on earth is at its peak.  Beltane celebrations are filled with feasts and sun magick, the name Beltane means “fire of Bel”. Beltane is a time to watch what you’ve been manifesting and working so hard towards come to life before your eyes. Celebrate, laugh, love, drink, eat and have a good time!Ways to Celebrate Play music that gets you feeling happy and excited. Beltane is a celebration of abundance and high energy, so play music that raises your energyPrepare something in the kitchen. Make a food that reminds you of the coming summer months, share it with whoever you live with if you can/want toGet crafty! You could draw, paint, write or even just work on a project for yourself.
