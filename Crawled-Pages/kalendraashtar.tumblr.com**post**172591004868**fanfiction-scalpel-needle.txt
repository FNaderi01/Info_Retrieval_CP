                            Fanfiction - Scalpel &amp; Needle
                            outoftheheartsabundance:missclairebelle:kalendraashtar:During the cardiac cycle, there is a critical time –
infinitesimal really – when a blow to the chest can cause a lethal disruption of
the heart rhythm and subsequent cardiac arrest. That is a commotio cordis.
I hope by the end of this chapter, you’ll understand why I named it so. Thank
you for the incredible support and generous words! Hugs XPreviouslyScalpel &amp; NeedlePart IX – Commotio CordisIf boredom could kill, Claire
Beauchamp would be painstakingly dead. Her practical side, restless nature and
passion for her work didn’t combine well with a sick leave. But her appendix
had been on the verge of rupturing, threatening to pollute her body with a
poison of its own making, and rest wasn’t an optional activity. Her abdomen
felt residually tender, but her mood had improved significantly after she had
been allowed to go home and wear her own pajamas. Geillis had come to visit, but
instead of concentrating on the task of distracting her – as any good visitor
would –, took hold of her comfortable armchair and started reading the latest
issue of “Surgical Field”, a reputed magazine on their line of work,
which had just arrived on the morning mail. Puffing in annoyance when she
realized that she had already watched the current episode of The Great
British Bake Off – not once, but twice! (And the tempering of chocolate was
only mediocre) – Claire rolled on the couch when her phone pinged with a
new message. Glancing at the screen, she realized the message came from an
unknown number.Unknown: How are you
feeling, Doctor Beauchamp?Claire quirked a brow and
quickly typed an answer. Claire: Alive. Who is this?Unknown: Have you already
forgotten your saviour? It’s a good thing I’m sure I didn’t take your memory
along with the appendix. Claire: Fraser?Unknown: Did you have any
other lifesaving procedures these days? Claire: How did you get my
number? Stole it from my chart?She smirked and swiftly added
his number to her list of contacts. A bantering session with James Fraser might
just be what was missing to speed her recovery. Fraser: Again, nurses.
Nothing is safe with them. Claire: I was thinking of
changing my phone number anyway. Fraser: OUCH. Are you
taking good care of that beautiful scar?Claire: Beautiful? I’ve
seen better suturing in 4th grade science projects. Borderline mangling. Fraser: :) Not all of us
can be as gifted as you. But then again, I don’t wear bright pink panties
either.Claire: …I’m blocking
your number now. And they were CORAL. I don’t wear pink. AS IF.Fraser: They were very
tasteful.                                                                Claire: Pretty sure you’re
violating about a thousand codes of conduct with this conversation. PATIENT
here.Fraser: IMPATIENT. Will you
come in to check your dressing today?Claire: I already did. I
knew you weren’t there in the morning. AH.“Ye’re smiling like an idiot.”
Geillis said sheepishly, startling her out of her reverie. The nurse was
glaring at her with an amused grin, her eyes intent. “Who are ye talking to?”“Fraser.” Claire shrugged,
nonchalantly throwing her phone to the side. “Poking him is always good fun.”“Hm.” The redheaded woman
hummed, putting the magazine on her lap, her index finger folded to mark the
page she had been reading. “Are ye friends now?”“Not friends.” Claire
furrowed her brows, fluffing the pillow she was leaning against. “I guess just
not…enemies. He isn’t as bad
as I thought he was.”“Oh, he is verra fine. Totally satisfactory, I’d say.”
Geillis gave her a sultry smile and a suggestive wink. “I’ve been telling you
that for months now.”“Well, I’m not joining his fan
club any time soon nor going to any support group for victims of his dazzling smile.” The surgeon huffed,
adjusting her loose bun. “Just trying some peaceful coexistence.” And then
noticing the entirely unconvinced look on her friend’s face. “He did save my life.”“I just think ye need someone.”
Geillis said slowly and more prudently than ever. It felt like watching a
jaguar trying to act like a well-behaved house cat. “Ye canna shield that heart
of yers forever.”“I already have someone.” Claire answered in a small
voice, avoiding the nurse’s intense gaze. Her meeting with Scalpel was just twenty-four hours away. She fervently hoped that
news of her predicament wouldn’t stop him from appearing at her door.  “Yer imaginary friend?” The redheaded
woman shook her head, contorting her beautiful lips painted in red. “Are ye
aware he is going to be just a man, like any other?”“No.” Claire said decisively,
the back of her neck burning – with shame? Apprehension? “Scalpel is different from every man I know. Attentive, sincere and intelligent.
He just is.”“Alright.” Geillis raised a
hand in surrender. “I hope he is all that
and has a map to the G-spot too. And a twin who loves a ginger woman.”Claire rolled her eyes and
immersed herself in the oblivion of daytime television again, as Geillis
continued to read. Her hands ached, empty, as they so often would when she
spent too much time away from a surgical table. “Claire…” The nurse called
haltingly, after a while. Her jade eyes were wide open in distress. “Did ye
read this issue already?”“No. What is it?” The surgeon
stretched her hand, waiting for her friend to offer her the medical journal. “Ye won’t like it.” Geillis greeted
her teeth, hesitantly offering her the offending literature. “Ye won’t like it
one bit.”***The afternoon of the next day
was spent in careful preparation, as Claire overthought and overanalysed every
detail, from her clothing to her doormat. She eventually opted for casual push-up
jeans and a blue sweater, since Scalpel probably
knew she was still in recovery from her surgery and had undoubtedly seen her
wearing worse. Claire had struggled with the decision to apply makeup to hide
her emaciated face, but chose to leave her skin clean and fresh. He had drawn
her face, portraying her in a light she was unable to see herself in – unquestionably,
he already knew whatever she was trying to hide. Cursing Geillis back to her
ancestor witch, she had thoroughly waxed, feeling simultaneously ridiculous and
wanton. Her hair was a creature with an independent life and she resigned long
before she was able to tame it. She sat on the couch and got
up multiple times to compose a misaligned picture frame or a crooked book,
until her sutures began throbbing, warning her to contain her obsessive
behaviour. Claire’s nails were a mess from biting and she darkly contemplated
the idea of greeting him with her hands carefully hidden inside her pockets.When Claire was almost asleep
on the couch, exhausted from expectation, the doorbell rang. She lunged for the
entrance, almost breathless – desperately trying to appear casual and composed –
and slowly opened it with a smile plastered on her face.And her heart skipped two
beats.@kalendraashtar : This is the cruelest, most venal trick in the book. I love ye for it nonetheless. Sidenote: I could sit and read Fraser/Claire text banter for DAYS. A side ficlet for such texting would not be entirely unwelcome. Raise your hand if you’ve been personally victimized by Chapter 9 of S&amp;N:Originally posted by isoldmysoultopaneraOriginally posted by dancingneonelephant@kalendraashtar  for the next chapter (I think this is may new gif for all the fabulous writers we have here!!!)I love love love you. And yes, I know this is cruel AF. I’m not happy yet with the next chapter so I’m sitting on it for a while longer. 🙈🙊
