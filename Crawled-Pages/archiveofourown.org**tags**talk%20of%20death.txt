    Summary
      Of course it’s Erwin Smith who pulls up a chair to the couch, carrying a spoon and a bowl of what appears to be some kind of stew. Levi stretches his mouth into a thin line. It smells better than anything he’d ever eaten, and like hell he was going to give Smith the satisfaction of knowing that.

      Cecil has had his eye on that perfect Scientist ever since he set foot in town. Cecil would love to be more than just the town radio host in Carlos' mind, but Cecil might be hiding a secret. Everyone has secrets, though - even Carlos. Sometimes secrets were meant to be told. But if we're going to be completely honest here, even the strongest relationships face their share of difficulties.

        This is so sad. :'(Also, not all Wizzrobes and Chuchus are bad, and anyone who says otherwise is a racist and a bigot...(Not all Bokoblins/Bulblins are bad or stay bad either, in the end credit of TP the Bulblin King is seen riding around Hyrule Field on Lord Bullbo; both of his horns have grown back, which symbolize most Bulblins being at peace with the other Hyruleans).https://zelda.gamepedia.com/King_Bulblin
