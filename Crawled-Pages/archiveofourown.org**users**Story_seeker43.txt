    Summary
      In every world there is pain, sorrow and joy. In every existence there are mistakes and triumphs. There are misunderstandings and differences.Having a daemon gives voice to the truth, for better or worse.If they so choose, anyone can hear the cries of a soul.That does not mean everyone listens.But it's harder to ignore one screaming in your face. The one where the cultivation world is rocked by daemons who speak their minds better than their people ever could and it changes everything.
