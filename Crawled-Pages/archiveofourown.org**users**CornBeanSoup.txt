    Summary
      Donatello and Michelangelo lead a good life. For mutant turtles anyway. With their adopted sister April they bend the law a tiny bit to make a living. Moving to New York was supposed to make life even better. What they did not expect was a certain do-gooder mutant turtle and his short-tempered brother to interfere with their job. And they sure as hell did not expect to join forces with them one day.Alternative universe - obviously.Mainly based on 2003 TMNT with a little TMNT 2012 sprinkled in.
