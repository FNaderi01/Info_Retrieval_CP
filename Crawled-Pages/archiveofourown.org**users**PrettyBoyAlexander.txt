    Summary
      The bartender considers him for a moment before holding out the hand that was over his just a second before. “I’m Magnus, bartender extraordinaire. While I certainly wouldn’t mind calling you pretty boy for the rest of the evening, I think it only fair that you share your name, too. Don’t you?”Slowly, Alec reaches out and grasps Magnus’s hand in a poor imitation of a handshake. He meets Magnus’s eyes and knows they both know that this is a mere prelude for what’s to come.“Alec,” he says slowly and watches as Magnus’s smile deepens.“Well, Alec, my shift ends in an hour. Wait for me?”

    Summary
      He’s better. He knows he is. He swore after that last time, after Magnus gently prodded at him, that he’d never do it again. And he hasn’t.But that doesn’t mean that he doesn’t miss it sometimes.Sometimes-- when the Institute is too much, when everything is pulling him in a thousand different directions and it’s all just too much-- he sits and he imagines it. It’s a shameful secret, a guilty pleasure if ever there was one but it brings him down. It helps.Or, Alec has a rough day.

    Summary
      It was never supposed to be like this. He was never supposed to feel like this. He wasn’t supposed to feel ever. Not like this. Not when he wasn’t on a roof, feet dangling in the air and the rush of the fall threatening to pull him over the edge. Not when the only other cause is nowhere near him.           And really that’s the problem, isn’t it?Or the one where Andrew feels and Neil disassociates.
