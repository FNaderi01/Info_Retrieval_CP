      To give a hand when no one else will. To be the hope for the forgotten. That is who Izuku wishes to be. Even if he is Quirkless, even if he is paralyzed from the waist down, he won't let that stop him. He is a vigilante, blending in with the night. He is a student, training to be a hero. He is Izuku. He helps those who society has forgotten. He is the hand that helps you up.

    Summary
      One day, Quirks appeared on the world, and several methods were devised to figure ot what could cause them to develop. One of the most accepted theories is related to the pinky toe: two joints meant a Quirk would develop, while no Quirk would develop with one joint.Chou Midoriya was born with a single joint on her pinky toe. For all intents and purposes, she should be Quirkless.So, how come her Quirk appears after death?

    Summary
      There are three fundamental truths about Midoriya Izuku, 12 years of age:1. He’s going to be a hero, no matter what. And not just any other hero, but the coolest one with cape and lots of fans and mortal enemies and… (You’ve got an idea)2. Kacchan is his best friend and always will be. (Even if he’s mean sometimes, they can work it out)3. Midoriya Hisashi is his father. (It doesn’t matter that his memories show him something else. Your memories sometimes get twisted when you’re very young, that’s what mum says)
But when he meets this tall, skinny stranger with blond hair who claims to be his mother’s former friend Izuku can’t help but wonder.

    Summary
      Izuku Midoriya lives in a world where 95% of the global population have quirks and the remaining quirkless suffer from discrimination. Being part of that minority, his dream of becoming a hero is laughed at or earns him looks of pity. But Izuku is set on proving everyone else wrong.As things would have it, quirkless people are far from being safe, and a quirkless hero may be what’s needed to save them.

    Summary
      Life is rough. Get over it. There are good things about it too, you know. Memories of your mom's kind smile, playing video games with your brother, nightly patrols...
Sure, a lot of it is shitty, but there are worse places to be. 
You just have to be brave enough to outlast all the turmoil. That's what makes a hero. A hero is someone who takes the brunt of the damage. A hero is someone who makes sure that everyone else is safe.
A hero is someone who makes sure that innocent people do not hurt as you have.
Because no one deserves that kind of pain.

    Summary
      Midoriya was tired.He was tired of Bakugo's bullying, he was tired of being called a useless deku, he was tired of feeling like a waste of space...The day he decides that he's going to end it once and for all, he meets his idol and from then on he starts to accept himself just the way he is... and fuck everyone else that thinks he's not enough!Midoriya was going to leave Bakugo behind... right?Then why, the moment he got to meet him again, after years of not sparing him more than a passing thought when seeing him on the news, he can't seem to get the rude, explosive, blond asshole out of his head?Maybe it's time for Midoriya to get his sweet revenge on Bakugo - he'll get what he deserves for the living nightmare that his childhood was because of him, right? That must be the only reason. The only, single, reason...

    Summary
      Getting an agency to hire Izuku as a work-study student is far easier than he expected it to be. With that out of the way, he can focus on learning about being a hero, spending time with his friends, and wondering if Shouto's siblings will like him. Of course, nothing is ever simple for him, a fact he is very quickly reminded of when a little girl runs into him outside an alley.

    Summary
      Midoriya Izuku never cared for Quirkist people. They discriminated based off Quirks. It was worse when he was less-than due to his lack of one.
So, when his idol tells him he can’t be a hero, he takes a different path.
Tsukauchi needed a raise after dealing with this. Eraserhead had a Problem Child. Nezu laughed in the background.
Who knew a Quirkless kid could do this much?

    Summary
      Hizashi sees the kid around the station, sometimes.He’s short, hunched in on himself in a way that reminds him starkly of Shouta before they became friends. The only real difference seems to be that he’s never fully quiet, mumbling to himself as he goes through a sheaf of heavily crumpled papers. That, and the freckles.

    Summary
      People have called Izuku worthless all his life, just because of a little genetics. One day, with a little help, he decides he won't take that anymore.
He gathers a group of people who want to change the way things are. They come from all over town, with all kinds of dreams. But they all want to change things.
A group of vigilantes rises up, that helps where it can. What the world doesn't know is that these law-breakers are not just some street rats.
They are heroes, and they will take UA by storm.
(The fic where the kids of 1A and 1B meet before, and add a little vigilantism to their resume.)

    Summary
      Go take a swan dive off the roof. Maybe you'll get lucky and get a quirk in your next life!! If 10 years ago someone had told Bakugou that those were the last words he'd ever say to Izuku he wouldn't have cared otherwise. The damn nerd needed to get his head out of the clouds and to stop chasing a useless pipe dream.You looked like you were asking for help. If someone had told Bakugou 10/years ago that was the last time he'd see Midoriya Izuku then he would've been glad to never see him again. His pride had taken a blow and his ego was severely bruised he didn't need that piece a shit nerd trying to save him. If 10 years ago he had known that he'd regret his words and his actions to the one boy who was never actually looking down on him..... Well he wouldn't have believed them. They say time heals all wounds but for some it just lets them fester and rot. 10 years later and he's rising to number 1, 10 years he's a household name and beloved hero, 10 years and he still looks behind him for that small frail body and doe green eyes. In 10 years he sees them again for the first time but they're broken and dull despite the smile. He wants to fix it but doesn't know how.
