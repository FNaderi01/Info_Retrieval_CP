    Chapter Text
    “Found you.”Tomura Shigaraki was finally going to kill Izuku Midoriya with his own two hands, just as he’d promised him in that mall all those months ago.It had been so long since he’d last seen the kid, but to him, it really didn’t feel like that long at all. He seemed to have grown barely a couple inches, was just a bit more filled in, and though he still had that wide-eyed look of terror he’d had at the mall, he held himself with more power and grace than back then.And yet, he was obviously still far from ready to face him from the way his balled fists were shaking, his eyes darting futilely for an escape that wasn’t there. Bakugou was much the same at Midoriya’s side, the mask of false bravado up high to cover how terrified he was at their situation.Alone with the leader of the villains who had just turned a portion of their city to rubble, with no backup in sight.The Voice had urged him to come here, to seek out One For All, and upon using search he realized why. It was undeniable that this boy was All Might’s chosen successor, now; impossibly, he had the same quirk as the man himself. How had this happened? Was Midoriya that gaudy icon’s son?He grinned as he thought of the face that failure would make when Tomura personally delivered what was left of his boy to him, and began to circle the high-schoolers patiently like a cat toying with its prey, his new cloak whispering behind him. They circled him as well, both parties gauging the other as they waited to see who would make the first move.And yet… there was something familiar in the boy’s face, now that he was looking, in the tilt of his mouth when it pulled into a desperate grimace at a testing feint, the aura of unshakable determination he seemed to give off as he analyzed the situation with a mumbling that he’d swear he’d seen someplace before. Tomura knew he’d seen it all somewhere before, from someone who wasn’t the Symbol of Peace, but who…?He didn’t dwell on it, didn’t let it distract him from the fight at hand as Bakugou finally got sick of the mounting tension and lunged for him with a staccato burst of explosions propelling him forward, a surprised cry of “Kacchan!” following him. Taking a guess at what he was going to pull, Shigaraki whirled around just in time to meet Bakugou face-to-face as the strident hero flipped over him, intending to attack from the rear. The blond's eyes bulged in horror as he realized his mistake, and Bakugou tried to change trajectory and pull back out of reach when he saw Shigaraki had turned with him, a hand already outstretched.Too slow; Tomura grinned with delight as he crowed, “Too bad! You should have joined us when you had the chance!” And reached out to grab his old captive, activating his new quirk to snatch the other’s away.Except, his fingers swiped through thin air. Something impossible had happened: black tentacles sprouted from Midoriya’s arm, and yanked Bakugou out of Tomura’s reach at the last second.Shigaraki’s jaw dropped in open shock as he stilled, limp hand still outstretched uncomprehendingly, completely flabbergasted by what he'd just witnessed. How on earth did Midoriya have another quirk? He certainly hadn’t had it during the sports festival, or when the attack on the summer camp had taken place. He was far too old to have manifested another quirk, and there was no way it could have been given to him. Unless…Unless he took it himself.Suddenly, his brain caught up to his earlier observations, and the implications hit him like a freight train. Could it be? Had his master… could Izuku Midoriya, of all people, possibly be…?He had to know. Reattaching his jaw and lowering his hand back to his side, Tomura blinked owlishly and asked, “…How did you do that? You didn’t have that power before.”Deku and Ground Zero both tensed and exchanged glances as if he’d asked a very sensitive question, and Midoriya licked his lips nervously before he haltingly replied, “…I-I don’t know. It just… appeared one day. After a strange dream.” Bakugou gave him a sharp look, as though he’d said too much, and Izuku winced.A memory from his childhood came flooding back at those words;
  “Sensei… what was it like for you, when you first activated your power?” Tomura Shigaraki was nine years old, and eating a rare dinner with his Sensei instead of on his own today. It was a reward for a job well done, and they were having the most flavorful and juicy steaks that he’d ever tasted. Wagyu, Kurogiri had called it.
The man across from him chuckled quietly, and replied, “Oh it was quite funny actually. I was at a sleepover with some other children, and when we went to bed for the night, my arm happened to be slung over the boy next to me.” All For One paused in his story to take a bite of his meal, and it gave Tomura a moment to process the bizarre thought that the godlike entity in front of him had been a child once too, and had done such strange, mundane things as have sleepovers.
“When I awoke the next day,” he continued, “I remember I’d had a very strange dream about breathing fire, but didn’t quite realize what had happened until I sneezed and set my host’s curtains ablaze! Haha, his parents hadn’t even cared; in fact, they’d wept with joy when they realized what had happened. They thanked me, because I had 'cured' their son.” He dabbed at his mouth with his napkin and added with a dark undertone, “…It’s amazing how differently that exchange would have gone had it taken place today, isn’t it?” All For One laughed somberly at the thought and reached across the small table to pat Tomura’s head, one of his gentle, understanding smiles stretched across what was left of his face. Tomura smiled sadly in return, and wished his master could see it.
It was almost undeniable, then. Izuku Midoriya was the child of his master. But how? Why? Why was he working with the heroes, being trained by his father’s NEMESIS, of all people?Surely, he didn’t know. But how could that be?Tomura thought back to the incident at Kamino, at his master’s half-hearted attempt to stop the student-led rescue, and realized what pain he’d have been in if he’d had to fight his own son, unknowingly standing at the side of his kidnapper. Yes, surely, SURELY he didn’t know, or else he would have addressed his father, even if it was to reject him.Another memory of a past conversation with All For One flitted through his mind, and then everything clicked horribly into place.
  “My family is gone…they’ve all been taken away from me, in one way or another. You and my colleagues are all I have now, little Tomura.”
Shigaraki felt his body grow cold with horror. He knew the feud between Sensei and All Might ran deep, but… what if his enemy had snatched away Sensei’s child to twist him against his father, out of some sick sense of spite and heroism? Quickly doing the math in his head, Tomura realized that Izuku would’ve been barely 3 at the time when he himself had been taken in by Sensei, nothing more than a helpless toddler. Young enough to not remember where he’d come from, certainly.All those times when All For One had looked at him with that mysterious, distant sort of melancholic affection…. his heart clenched with pity and horror. Sensei had hand-picked Tomura as his successor, yes, but had it also been to distract himself from the pain? To move on from a child taken away? Tomura chewed his cracked lip nervously in thought.By now, the young heroes had noticed their opponent had gone from goggling in shock at Deku to openly staring with something like horrified fascination and affection in his eyes for seemingly no reason at all, making no clear move to attack them further, and the baffled teens came together and whispered uneasily amongst themselves as the skirmish came to a standstill.Well, then, if Izuku really was Sensei’s long lost son who had been snatched up and corrupted by his greatest enemy, then perhaps Tomura needed to bring him home and show him who his true family was, just as his master had done for him. Was that why The Voice had pulled him to Izuku? Not to kill him, but to save him…?Distantly, beneath the shock and horror, he felt the incessant yawn of longing and dissatisfaction that had echoed within him since he'd woken up, something new and ancient and powerful inside demanding that he stalk forward and rip that strangely bright quirk from right out of the teenager's bones, like a beast reaching for a slab of meat just out of reach beyond its cage.And yet...Izuku was staring hard at the ground by Tomura's feet with a furrowed brow, looking to be at a loss as he murmured with Bakugou. He chewed his lip just like Sensei did when he was thinking hard, obviously trying to figure out what the change in his demeanor meant and how best to strategize around it. In that moment, he looked so much like his father that suddenly the dull emptiness waiting to be filled in his chest didn't matter anymore. In that moment, Tomura made up his mind: he would save Izuku from the corrupting influences that had spirited him away, and take him under his wing as his treasured little brother.As if on cue, the decimated concrete beneath their feet began to quiver with the telltale sign of Gigantomachia’s approach, and Shigaraki allowed himself a grin, not maniacal or cruel as before but still excited nonetheless; he couldn’t wait for Izuku to be integrated into his new family. This change in perspective on him was strange and very sudden, but far from unwelcome. He’d always been rather fixated on the kid; perhaps this was destiny.He’d be a better brother, this time. He had to be.Somehow, the face he was making along with the steady approach of colossal footsteps seemed to send Izuku and Bakugou into a barely-contained panic, as they realized that reinforcements were coming their way fast, and they’d already lost their chance to run.
“Shit, there’s something coming… there’s something MASSIVE coming…!” Bakugou snarled as his wide eyes darted between Shigaraki and the direction of the rapidly approaching giant, pacing nervously in front of Izuku. Izuku was still, however, and seemed to grimly accept his fate as he reached a decision.“Kacchan… it’s me he wants this time. You’ve got to run!” The other boy whipped around to face him so fast Shigaraki’s neck ached in sympathy, beady red eyes bright with fury, disbelief, and indignation. “WHAT? No, you dumbass! Do you really think-?!” Izuku interrupted as he reached out to grab the straps of Ground Zero’s hero costume, cold terror and determination and fire in his eyes as he yelled, “And I’m not losing you to them again! We can’t beat them all, not just the two of us! But, if you go now and bring reinforcements, we might both still make it! Go get Endeavor, or Aizawa-sensei, or someone who’s close by, before they get too far with me!” As he said this, Izuku transferred the straps of his teammate’s costume to one hand and hitched it back behind his shoulder like a pitcher winding up, the motion yanking Bakugou along with it as if he were no heavier than an empty backpack and not a classmate who weighed just as much, if not more than, Izuku’s own body weight.“Deku, what are- DON’T YOU FUCKING DARE-!!” Ground Zero roared with indignation and horror as his classmate became interwebbed with a brilliant violet glow, the air vibrating around him as his bunching muscles tensed and hummed with power, before launching Bakugou so hard a small tidal wave of dust and rubble rippled out away from him.It was a rather impressive toss; the only other hero around disappeared over the horizon several blocks away just as Gigantomachia came sprinting out from behind a nearby building, and then it was just Tomura, Izuku, and the League of Villains encasing them on all sides.The boy stood alone in the middle, breathing fast and hard as he turned every way and found himself quickly surrounded on all sides by every member in the League, with only seconds before they closed in. Eyes burning with terror and desperation, he lunged for Shigaraki in a desperate attempt to grab him and gain some leverage over the other villains, his only hope to evade capture now.Smoothly, Shigaraki sidestepped the grapple, caught the boy’s arm, and twisted it carefully behind his back with one of his new enhancement quirks. He brought his other hand up to gently grasp the boy’s throat, just as he had done at the mall.Checkmate.Midoriya went stone still under his hand at the feel of all five fingers pressed against his thundering pulse, and he didn’t start breathing again until Shigaraki murmured in his ear, “Easy, now, it’s okay. I have more control than before, so I can hold things without dusting them now. Unless I want, to of course. Isn’t that nice?”He smiled as his league chuckled around him and congratulated him on his near-effortless capture, before he threw himself back into the role of leader. Tomura didn’t let go of Izuku until the boy was blindfolded and cuffed, then left him under the care of the nonessential league’s members as he and the rest set out to execute the plan and wreak havoc on the scrambling heroes.Izuku would thank him for this, one day, but for now, he had a plan to execute.
By the time they'd all regrouped at the extraction point, the sun was setting low on the horizon, and Tomura was pleased to see that his underlings had successfully fended off a rescue attempt on their own with little trouble. In addition, he had retrieved the doctor, and gotten some shiny new quirks along the way.All in all, today had been a very, very good day.Mr. Compress released Izuku from the marble he’d been contained in with a flourish, and Tomura took Izuku by the neck again as he stumbled forward. “Who-where-?!” He gasped, trying to glance around with eyes that were probably wide and hopeful under the blindfold, before sagging in disappointment at the feel of Shigaraki’s hand returning to his neck. “You thought you were being rescued? How cute!” Tomura exclaimed, ruffling the boy’s hair just because he could now, and chuckling as he cringed away.They stood there waiting for only a few minutes before the previously arranged helicopters began to appear in the distance, and Tomura felt Izuku’s already rabbity heart rate triple under his fingers at the sound of blades chopping air closing in. Before, he would have grinned maliciously and mocked him for his fear. Now, though…”It’s alright, Izuku,” Tomura cooed without an ounce of malice, “We’re going to take good care of you. I’ve got you,” Carefully, he held his arm as he pulled the quietly hyperventilating student up the steep steps of the landing skid and into the aircraft. Tomura strapped him in next to himself, in the middle seat. Surrounded by his new family.“I’ve got you.”Shigaraki watched the beautiful sunset from outside his window on the helicopter as they took off, and ignored for the moment how a tightly curled Izuku was shaking minutely under the arm he’d slung over him. The absolutely fantastic spray of colors felt like a victory fanfare to end his perfect day, and Tomura sighed happily as he sprawled out and relaxed into his seat. Sleepily, he rested his head on top of Izuku’s as he dozed, like an exhausted child napping with his sibling in the backseat of a long car ride home, amusement park in the rearview mirror. He felt Izuku swallow and grind his teeth under his cheek, and despite feeling him tense with the effort to hide it, his shivering didn’t decrease.Tomura would repay Sensei for this wonderful new power he’d been granted by returning what had been snatched away from him. Father and son would finally be reunited on the glorious day they managed to break him out; Shigaraki had no plans to let his savior rot in prison. And if he was wrong about his little hunch, well… having his successor taken away and turned against him seemed like a fitting punishment for All Might’s treatment of his master, anyways.
        Notes:
          Poor Izuku. He has no idea what’s going on. :,)Kudos and comments are appreciated.Thank you for reading! &lt;3

    Chapter Text
    This was the nightmare scenario.Izuku sat tightly curled on the stiff leather of his flight seat, knees up to his chest with his heels perched on the edge, bound arms looped tensely over his legs as a swooping in his stomach signaled that they had taken off. He felt sick with horror as he tried not to think about what that would mean for him, how he might be leaving everything he had ever known behind forever. For all he knew, he may have already seen the last slip of sunlight he’d ever see in his life through a dusty blindfold.… As something that could still be considered human, that is.
   “We’re going to take good care of you.” 
Izuku shuddered and cringed into a tighter ball as a wave of cold dread welled up inside him. This was different from when they’d snatched Kacchan, and he knew it. He was here as a prisoner of war, not a recruit hopeful, and he knew he wouldn’t be lucky enough to have a well-placed tracker save him as it had Kacchan; the villains had learned their lesson well, and done a thorough sweep for bugs before they’d taken off. Deku was being carted off to a location no one else knew of, with no hope of making contact with another hero or reaching out for help from inside the helicopter. Once they arrived, he would be completely at the villains’ mercy until the heroes could find him.And it had taken them months to locate the base they’d attacked today.What was going to happen to him? Would Shigaraki try to force him to give up One For All, then dust him? Turn him into a noumu without any fanfare? Or, would he get “special treatment”, as All Might’s student? If they really knew he was the man’s successor, as he feared, would they torture him? Tell the world his secret, and hold up what was left of him as a trophy?All Might… he would be so disappointed to know how easily he’d been caught. He had entrusted his legacy to Izuku, a quirk passed down through generations of heroes, and now because he’d failed to get away it was at risk of falling into the hands of the villains. What would Aizawa-sensei say, when he found out? Or his friends? When would he ever even see them all again? A week, a month… a year? How far was he going to fall behind in his classes, assuming he could even return to them by the end of this?…And his poor mom…Izuku hissed through his teeth as he fought back the tears that wanted to form beneath the blindfold, feeling angry with himself for his thoughts. No, he wasn’t doing this. He wasn’t going to break before they’d even arrived, he wasn’t going to break at all! Deku had more faith in his friends and the heroes looking out for him than that. He was a hero in training himself, now, and he needed to find a way out of this mess. He needed to be strong.Reluctantly, Izuku made himself uncurl in his seat as he took another shaky, steadying breath. He then almost jumped out of his skin as he felt Shigaraki, who was strapped in to his left, lazily drape an arm over his shoulder to lean against him comfortably, as if they were two good pals riding a cramped train together.A burning swell of anger and indignation rose in the teen as the white-haired villain had the gall to actually use him as a headrest and go right to sleep, as if there was nothing wrong with kidnapping a highschooler and using them as a pillow on the ride over to torture, mutilate, and eventually kill them. (Assuming that death would be a luxury he’d even be afforded, that is.) Izuku ground his teeth with helpless frustration and made a conscious effort to not shrug Shigaraki off. Instead, he focused on doing his best to suppress the shivers he hadn’t even noticed skittering up and down his spine until just then, and continued his efforts to de-escalate his panic. A hand rested limply against his arm now, and Izuku desperately hoped that Shigaraki’s powers couldn’t activate in his sleep as his own sometimes did...Deep breaths. He had to stay calm and passive. The last thing he wanted to do right now was provoke an attack; trying to win a fight with whoever of the League was crammed in this helicopter with him, God knows how high up, while blindfolded, handcuffed, and strapped in would not go well. Izuku shuddered at the mental image, then frowned at himself. Focus.Ok. What could he learn about his surroundings that could give him an edge?He couldn’t see anything from behind the blindfold, and between Shigaraki’s soft snoring by his ear and the constant, deafening shriek of the flight machinery above them he couldn’t hear anything, either. He had almost nothing to work with here, though with how securely his arms were bound in their quirk-cancelling restraints it seemed there was little he could have done anyways...The anxiety he was trying desperately to push back curdled in his gut as he struggled to figure out what to do. How much time did he have? Could he afford to rest and bide his time until they arrived, or would he be thrown straight onto a gurney once they exited the helicopter if he wasn’t ready to fight his way out and make a run for it? Surely, that had to be it, what they were planning for him once they arrived. It just made the most sense. He was going to be Shigaraki’s very first experiment with his new powers, and it was probably going to be a horrific blend of all the scenarios he’d feared.It would certainly explain why he was being so clingy. His back hunched at an uncomfortable angle as Shigaraki, now fully asleep, sagged against him. A pang of irritation pulsed through Izuku and he clung to it as a distraction; somehow, he was bizarrely reminded of when he’d occasionally see older kids sitting on their younger siblings or pretending to faint on them purely to be a menace, long ago and far away in the park he’d loved to play at as a little kid. Why was Shigaraki doing this, passing out on him like some obnoxious older brother? He couldn’t be that afraid he was going to try and make a break for it; by now, that ship had sailed. Literally. Was it some kind of convoluted power play, then, taunting him by showing that he was so little of a threat that he could literally sleep on top of him and there was nothing he could do about it? Or, had he really just… accidentally fallen asleep like this? Deku wasn’t quite sure HOW Shigaraki had been given All For One, especially with the original holder locked away in one of the most secure facilities on Earth, (and wasn’t THAT a dark line of thought to pursue…) but he knew from the radio chatter he’d picked up that it had involved him floating unconscious in a tank of some sort. Perhaps, whatever they had been doing to him had been interrupted before they were ready to let him out, and now with the adrenaline of fight-or-flight gone, Shigaraki was just now suffering the repercussions of being woken early? Izuku thought back to his horrific fight with Muscular and what it’d been like coming down from the endorphin high, and felt the beginnings of pity for the criminal. Shigaraki hadn’t gone through anything near as traumatic physically, sure, but somehow, he had been convinced to step into a tank, close his eyes, and allow one of the most nefarious doctors in the country to tinker on him like he was some kind of creepy lab experiment. What had gone so wrong, for the man next to him to have been brought to this point? What kind of life had he led to let someone as monstrous and terrifying as All For One have so much agency over what he became?Although… now that he thought about it, if he was lucky enough to be thrown in a cage instead of a medical suite when they touched down, asking Shigaraki himself that question may actually be a good idea. Sympathizing with his captors and gaining their trust could help protect him from their more sadistic tendencies, and he could get some valuable intel to boot. Who knows… he might even save someone.For the first time since Shigaraki had appeared before himself and Kacchan, Izuku felt a twinkle of hope; he’d have to swallow more than a little pride, and maybe say some unsavory things in order to cozy up to his kidnappers, but if he was successful then the information he could get out of this whole ordeal might even be worth it. A small, hopeful smile began to form on his face.Just then, he felt something dribble through his hair and down his scalp, and groaned in disgust as he realized that Shigaraki was drooling on him in his sleep. Deciding that maybe a mystery brawl in a helicopter wasn’t that bad after all, Izuku tried to struggle out from under his unconscious tormentor, but Shigaraki just muttered something in his sleep, moved his arm so it was hooked around his waist, and used it to tuck the teen closer and slump his full weight against him. His back bent into an awkward crescent from the way he was pulled in sideways, and he had to twist his neck at an odd angle as he was forced to fully support Shigaraki’s head and torso.Great.He’d been promoted from pillow to mattress. Izuku growled quietly with annoyance. Now, Shigaraki really was crushing him, and he didn’t have enough leeway to wiggle out from under him this time. He was sure that to an outside observer, he looked ridiculous, half-crumpled in his seat under Shigaraki’s weight. In fact, under the endless racket of the carriage, he swore he could hear someone snicker at him.Izuku sighed. This was going to be a long flight.Time passed.It had been a hard, slow process, but Izuku managed to gradually squirm around so he was facing away from his captor, with Shigaraki leaning sideways against his back. The supervillain’s arm was now slung around his middle as though he were a giant teddy bear, and when Deku curled into a loose ball and let his weight rest against his knees, he found he could actually relax without focusing some muscle group or another on holding up his captor’s weight. It was so mercifully comfortable compared to the tense charlie horse juggling game he’d been playing before, he could cry.Deku still couldn’t hear anything over the hypnotic, muffled thwop thwop thwopping of the rotor blades above his head, and with his eyes already closed under his blindfold from the bliss of letting himself go limp for the first time in two hours, it was far too easy to just rest his cheek on his knees and drift off. He’d had a long, stressful, adrenaline-riddled day, and he could feel the darkness at the edge of his consciousness beckoning him. ‘Maybe a nap would be ok, just for a moment,’ he reasoned with himself; he’d need all the energy he could get to deal with whatever hell was waiting for him at the other side of this flight, after all.Deku’s last thought before sleep claimed him was,  ‘at least Shigaraki isn’t drooling on me anymore...’ Dabi stared at the bizarre sight in front of him with a raised brow, mystified. The newly reborn leader of the League of Villains, who had just led them through a bloody and victorious battle against the top heroes of the nation, and their current captive, an incredibly powerful teen hero who had apparently taken out that Overhaul bastard almost by himself, were….slumped against each other like a couple of kids tuckered out at the playground and fast asleep.
   Cuddling. 
Well, not consciously. At some point, Shigaraki had fallen asleep, listing to the side and trapping the young hero under him. Izuku had seemed to be afraid to wake him, (rightfully so; Shigaraki was an ass when woken up early) and Dabi couldn't help but snicker at how ridiculous he looked. Like a startled rabbit who suddenly found a wolf napping on its head. From the sulky expression he got in return, he could guess that the teen had somehow heard him.After a grueling and rather entertaining battle between Midoriya, his restraints, the forces of gravity, and the patience of the sandman, the kid finally managed to win himself a more comfortable position as a human mattress without waking their leader, and escaped his flying prison through the only avenue available to him: sleep. Honestly, Dabi wasn’t sure what impressed him more at this point: Deku’s tenacity or how heavy a sleeper Shigaraki was.It was quiet for a bit after that. Dabi almost nodded off himself, when he saw it happen.A random bout of turbulence knocked the carriage around harder than before, and Shigaraki was jolted awake. Midoriya stayed fast asleep, however, and didn’t rouse as his head rolled off his knees to jostle around loosely at an angle that can’t have been comfortable. Instead of taking the logical path here, which would have been to simply turn over and sleep against the chopper door while leaving the kid to suffer his fate of a cricked neck come morning, Shigaraki had turned to him and… gently readjusted the unconscious Midoriya so his head was settled back onto his knees, tweaked his ear affectionately, leaned against him again, and dropped right back off to sleep as if he’d done the most natural thing in the world.Dabi was dumbstruck. Why would he take care of their prisoner like that? He seriously doubted his leader was just feeling merciful from having an extremely good day; up until this most recent encounter, Shigaraki had despised Izuku Midoriya. This was the same kid he’d slapped with a kill-on-sight order in the summer camp raid.Dabi knew the brat wasn’t here by choice, or with them as some sort of spy; his hopeful reaction when he’d heard his friends show up to rescue him before being shoved into a marble was proof of that. When Dabi saw that Shigaraki had finally managed to capture the brat as they’d responded to the summons, he had assumed the unlucky sap was going to be tortured to death to shake up the heroes, or turned into one of those noumu things. Or both.Instead, Shigaraki was treating him with a careful kind of reverence, like he’d seen something important or special that hadn't been there before.… Maybe he had.There was something almost… familial about the way the new All For One holder was treating his young enemy, and Dabi couldn’t help but reminisce…Uncomfortably, he rubbed his arm and pushed back the unwanted childhood memories that tried to surface, and instead stared out the window at the gentle midnight rain spattering the helicopter window as he reflected on what was going to happen next.They were going to get set up at the new base, paid for by a mysterious benefactor on Shigaraki’s behalf well before he’d gotten in the tank, and get settled in to plan out their next move. There wasn’t much unpacking to do, as they’d basically only brought the clothes and weapons on their backs, so the first few days would probably be spent cleaning the place up and getting everything ready to go as their new base of operations.Across from him and to the left, Mr. Compress dozed leaning against the door of the helicopter as he bounced his leg impatiently, and to Dabi’s right, the doctor sat wringing his hands excitedly and staring at their new acquisition with a disturbing fascination, clearly fantasizing about which horrific ‘medical procedure’ he was going to use to him first when they arrived. Dabi almost wanted to wince with pity for the kid. He smirked. Almost, but not really.On the other side of him, he could see Toga wrapped in nothing but one of the emergency blankets the helicopter had stashed in the overhead compartments, still caked in the long-dried blood of her rampage, her frame shivering and wracked by harsh sobs inaudible under the steady beating of the helicopter blades above. She was obviously still torn up over the death of Twice; she had been inconsolable since she snapped out of the catatonic state she went into after killing every hero she could get her hands on. They had found her, sitting alone and exhausted and very still,  in a dark half-caved room full of corpses. She didn’t even care that they’d captured Izuku, who she’d obviously had a huge crush on since well before this; she had stumbled right past him and climbed aboard without a word.Hesitantly, his arm half-raised as if to reach out and comfort her somehow, then decided against it with a shake of his head as he brought it up to comb through his messy hair instead. He was no good at this comfort shit, and with him being unable to even say anything over the noise of the chopper it would probably just be awkward anyways. His head dropped against the back of the seat with a soft thunk as he closed his eyes and considered allowing himself to sink back and process his own emotional wounds for a second. No, no… not yet, not in front of the others…he peeked an eye open to instead stare at the pair in front of him; his leader’s face was an uncharacteristic mask of peace and tranquility, contrasted by Midoriya’s own scrunched features of tension and dread, unable to truly escape even in his dreams. Still, he was stricken for a moment by just how similar their features were when they slept, and he wondered again if there was some kind of bizarre family drama going down here. Hmm. The corners of his mouth quirked upwards for a moment as the possibilities raced through his head; now,  that was something he could chew on for a bit, to keep his mind off things…Slowly, his eye crept closed again as the noisy carriage rocked gently in the rain. Then again… maybe those two in front of him had the right idea after all….They arrived at the new base early the next morning, when the predawn light was barely brushing over the horizon and the sun had yet to appear.For the merciless killer he’d proven himself to be yesterday, Shigaraki seemed to be oddly endeared by the sight of his young hostage fast asleep and curled peacefully next to him. The others privately found it to be a pleasant change of pace, as well; most subjects they brought in for the creation of noumu were crying and screaming to be let go by this point in the journey. Still, they all braced for the chaos that was to come as they waited for Tomura to jerk the teen into wakefulness and yank him viciously to his feet. Instead, however, their leader carefully scooped him up to personally carry him inside, much to everyone else’s surprise and appreciation. He must still be in an excellent mood from the day before, then.Once in the new compound, the supervillain sleepily listened with half an ear to as the doctor explained the layout of the building, Toga’s hoarse hiccups the only other noise echoing down the dusty hall. Not noticing the eager, pointed look the good doctor gave the boy in his arms when mentioning where the lab was, Tomura just nodded drowsily and headed the opposite way, where the holding cells were. He completely missed the look of disappointment that descended onto Doctor Ujiko’s face as he stood staring after them, arms half-raised as if ready to receive Izuku and deliver him to the surgical theater himself.Gently, Shigaraki set Izuku down on his new cot in the largest, most heavily reinforced cell they had. He was rather regretful about having Sensei’s son stay in a dusty cage like this; however, until he was able to take a moment to sit down and explain what was going on to him, it was better to err on the side of caution.No way was he going to risk losing him to the heroes again.Tomura perched on the mattress beside him, and removed the student’s blindfold and restraints before tucking them away into his cloak. When he drew his hand back out, he was holding a special device he’d snagged from the ruined lab. It was a metal cuff made with the newest high end quirk-cancelling technology, and it would ensure the boy could be safely defanged without having to be strapped into a quirk-cancelling straightjacket like some kind of prisoner.He snapped it onto the boy’s wrist and pocketed the key, and after a moment of thought, reached back in and pulled out an apple he’d found floating around the pockets of his new cloak. Presumably, it had been intended as a snack for the cloak’s previous owner. As the man was now dust in the wind, however, he assumed Izuku might appreciate it more; they hadn’t exactly had time to stop for dinner last night, after all. He left it on the side table next to the cot, and stood to leave, his own stomach rumbling grumpily.He got halfway to the cell door before he hesitated again, looking around the bare, oppressive room sadly. He perked up as a thought occurred to him, and strode out into the hall. A moment later, he returned with a spare duvet under his arm. Tomura settled it over Izuku’s sleeping form instead of the scratchy, mothworn scrap of cloth that sat folded at the end of the bed, and left the cell once again.By the time he was done ferrying in objects, there was a divider for the toilet, a toothbrush as well as a cup to hold it, toothpaste, floss, soap, some toilet paper, a small pile of interesting-looking books, a small mountain of spare pillows, some hand lotion, a rug, and even a stuffed bunny that had been gathering dust decorating a shelf. Maybe Izuku was a little old for that one, but it had reminded Tomura of one that Hana had loved, and...He shook his head to dispel the memories that threatened to overwhelm him, and hastily moved on.Shigaraki hovered and fussed for a short while longer, wondering if there was anything else he could do to make his sensei’s child more comfortable upon waking. He knew the kid would be under the impression that he was here for something terrible considering their past interactions, but Sigaraki fully intended to show him that he was safe here.He really was going to take good care of him, just as he’d promised. Better than that damned All Might ever had.Finally deciding that he’d done all he could for the moment, Tomura exited the cell. Peering at Izuku one last time through the viewing slot on the door, Shigaraki smiled softly and whispered, “Welcome home, little brother.” Then, he followed the heavenly scent of coffee brewing deeper within the base.

    Chapter Text
    Izuku snuggled into his new duvet, relishing the quiet morning he’d drifted awake to.He wasn’t one to sleep in. Normally, he was up with the sun to enjoy a morning jog in the predawn mist before showering and tucking into breakfast. His alarm hadn’t gone off yet, however, which must mean that today was Sunday. He could sleep in for as long as he wanted!This was a rare treat; normally, the other kids would be up and about by now, and between Kacchan’s temper, morning training routines, and the typical bickering over whose turn it was with the tv down in the rec room, everyone without earplugs was up by 10am or sooner whether they liked it or not.Izuku was stiff and sore from whatever training he’d had yesterday, so he was thankful the others were being so considerate this time about keeping quiet.Of course, that could also have something to do with his unfortunate sleeping habits; recently, the previous One For All users had begun to show him snippets of their lives through his dreams. Some of them were mundane and domestic, some were important milestones in their lives. Most, however, were intense battles they’d lived through.And the very worst of them were against All For One.With those, he’d often wake in a cold sweat, thrashing in half-shredded sheets or among the mess of an unintentionally Detroit-smashed room, as if his body had instinctively tried to fight off the ancient nemesis chasing him through his nightmares. They weren’t always bad enough to activate his quirks in his sleep, however; most nights, he slept soundly until morning, even with the visions.Tonight, however, he’d been unlucky.It had been terrifying. Bits and pieces had been fuzzy, but Izuku had seen enough to grasp what had been going on; All For One had captured a young Daigoro Banjo, and seemed sadistically intent on getting One For All out of the boy any way he could. He didn’t care that Banjo was still barely a teen, only a few years older than Izuku was now, and showed neither mercy nor remorse as he bustled about preparing to subject the young man to various nightmarish torments. Izuku could feel his predecessor's mounting terror through the memory, and the cheery tune All For One hummed as he went about readying the implements of torture had been nothing short of spine-chilling.Deku had felt as Banjo desperately braced himself, how multiple strategies and techniques for getting through intense pain raced through his mind before the dream suddenly came to an abrupt end, and he was spared from seeing whatever had happened next.It was odd; usually, the vestiges would speak with him afterward or at least end the experience on a more conclusive note, but the end of this vision had seemed almost...cut off. As though the power cord had been yanked mid-program.That wasn’t the end of his nightmares tonight, however. At some point, before he received Banjo's vision, he’d had one about Shigaraki snatching him off a battlefield and taking him away to some dark, cramped prison. All in all, Izuku had had a very rough night.Though the rapidly disappearing impressions of the third and final dream he’d had were pleasant, he couldn’t help but feel stressed upon waking. That first dream, the one about Shigaraki, had felt so… real. And it was very unusual that he’d remember anything he dreamed of before the vestige’s visions took over...Putting it out of his mind, Izuku rolled sideways to take some weight off a tension knot in his shoulder and decided he wanted to start the day on a more pleasant note. He frowned as he now felt the jab of an unwanted zipper against his side; was he still wearing his hero costume? This wasn’t at all unusual; he’d fallen straight to sleep after a long, tiring evening of training more times than he could count.Still… after being haunted by such awful battles in his sleep, he would have liked to return to the realm of the living in something a little more comfortable. He kicked over and settled onto his belly, finally finding a comfortable position. Then, he smiled with relief and relaxed into his unusually tough, strange-smelling bedding. Distantly, he thought about how he should remember to wash these new sheets when he got up, to get rid of that odd, dusty smell they must’ve gotten at the factory.Something nagged at the back of his head again, something about that first set of dreams feeling just a tad too real for comfort, but he pushed it away with annoyance to savor his precious extra hour of sleep.The idea of Shigaraki coming to take him away was disturbing but unfounded. He was safe here, at UA.He yawned, drifting softly in and out of consciousness.Except… his brow crumpled. Except, if he was sleeping at UA, then why had his mom picked him up and carried him to bed? She hadn’t been able to do that since he’d put on weight in his training to receive All Might’s quirk, and wouldn’t have had any reason to be in the dorms so late at night, anyways.It hadn’t felt like her carrying him, either; it had felt like someone with a lithe, masculine build. Oh god, had Aizawa-sensei done it? Or All Might? His face scrunched as embarrassment flared at the thought. Reluctantly, he decided to peek a bleary eye open to see where he was.Not his room at home, or his dorm. Someone else’s, then?His eye drooped shut again, not quite awake enough to fully register what he was seeing. Who else could have carried him up, if it hadn’t been one of his teachers? A classmate, maybe? Shoji? Todoroki? It couldn’t have been Kacchan, he knew that much for sure… The thought of his old childhood friend gently carrying him up to his room instead of blasting him halfway across the rec area for hogging his favorite spot on the couch was so absurd Izuku actually let out an amused snort.Kacchan… the hospital… evacuating citizens…Shigaraki.Izuku bolted upright, blind with panic, gulping air and shaking as if he’d just surfaced from a mile below the arctic ocean.Where- where was he? Why- how had he-?!His heart went cold. It hadn’t been a nightmare, had it?He clutched his chest as it suddenly felt far too small, and Izuku began choking on what air he’d brought in as anxiety overwhelmed him. He had been captured. By Shigaraki. The new holder of All For One. Who knew, who knew what he had and who wanted to steal it away.His predecessor's vision from earlier came rushing back so fast it made his head spin, and Izuku clapped a hand over his mouth and gagged as he felt physically nauseous with terror. So many good people had died to get this quirk into the future, into his hands, and now he was only one step away from losing it to the very forces they’d sacrificed so much to evade.Breathe, Midoriya.In 7, out 11... In 7, out 11… Just how Aizawa-sensei taught him in the crisis response training section…The thought of his teacher made his heart clench and his head cloud with panic all over again.What had happened since he’d been captured? How much destruction had Shigaraki caused while he was trapped in the League's clutches? Had everyone else made it out of that terrible battle alright?More pressingly, was he alright?Quickly, Deku patted himself down, immensely relieved that none of his limbs were chained to the scruffy cot he was sitting on. He found no needles, unwanted IVs, or damage otherwise to his person that would suggest he had been paid a visit by a mad doctor in the night. He did, however, find a strange device clasped onto his left wrist.Izuku clutched the offending arm in his right hand and turned his wrist over carefully to inspect it, as curious as he was apprehensive. The device was about two inches thick and hexagonal with rounded edges and corners. There were no obvious markings or screens aside from a bright green indicator light and the black magnetic key reader alongside it, but the cuff was thick and clunky enough to suggest it was stuffed with some kind of tech. Deku noted that his skin felt strange where it was touching the inner metal of the band, as though it was being pressed against a plasma globe.What was this thing...? A shock collar? Some sort of monitoring device? He didn’t know, but Izuku was sure that whatever it was, he wouldn’t want it on him when he escaped.After a moment's consideration, however, he decided to leave it be; for all he knew, it was rigged with an alarm system that would trigger if he were to try and tamper with it, and he didn’t want to take any risks until he could gather more intel about his situation.Izuku let out a slow, shaking breath, focusing on collecting himself. It wouldn’t help him to waste energy panicking, and he didn’t seem to be in any immediate danger.For now.Feeling a little calmer, the teen turned to survey his surroundings:He was in what was obviously intended to be a prison cell; the walls were some kind of thick brick painted over with peeling white paint, and the door was a dark blue stainless steel. It had two slots, one for peering in at the prisoner and one with a counter built-in at chest height for slotting food trays through. He had a toilet and a sink installed in the corner, and there was a single tiny window at the very top of his cell allowing a slice of midmorning light to shine in. The bare, dusty overhead lamp was built directly into the ceiling, and overall, it was laid out just as any cell would be in a typical prison.The rest of the room, however, was absolutely nothing like he had been expecting; instead of the bare, desolate interior lined with racks of torture devices he’d been dreading on the flight over, there was a bafflingly colorful explosion of miscellaneous items scattered about. Things like books, spare pillows, even a divider so he could have some merciful privacy on the toilet… Whoever set up this room had clearly done their best to make him more comfortable, despite the fact that they were keeping him here against his will.Somehow, it was almost creepier than if he’d woken up tied down alongside a tray of scalpels. At least then, he would know what to expect; this almost made it seem like someone here cared for him. Maybe Toga had been in charge of setting up his cell…? Although, he got the sense that despite her, uh, fixation, she didn’t care all that much for his actual comfort; besides, he seriously doubted Shigaraki would approve of letting her go this far without good reason....Unless...Had he gotten lucky? Were they really going to try and recruit him, after all?If this was the case, then it would mean he had far more time and freedom to plan for an escape than if they were going to try and use brute-force methods. Instead, the villains would be focusing on trying to get in his head, giving him a chance to stall for time; depending on their tactics, he may even be able to gather otherwise unattainable intel for the others. There was still some hope after all!Deku let himself breathe a small sigh of relief at the revelation. Considering the situation, he was probably in the best-case scenario as far as long-term survival went.… Again, for now.As he relaxed, Izuku felt a pang of discomfort lance through his stomach and realized he hadn’t eaten since breakfast the previous day. He considered the slightly bruised apple sitting innocently on the side table by the bed with narrowed, mistrustful eyes; based on how they’d decorated the room, The League seemed to be playing nice with him, but he knew it could also be an elaborate scheme to make him lower his guard and so they could trick him into giving up his quirk. Could he even trust that his food wasn’t drugged with something of a mind-controlling nature that would leave his defenses down and his mind open to suggestion...?Perhaps it would be better, then, to try and escape while he could? After all, he might be forgiven for an escape attempt now, but if he were to try to pull one while pretending to go along with their recruiting tactics, it would be a huge risk. At the very least, he should test his prison for weak points, or try to figure out a plan of attack, just in case... Perhaps set up a diversion that could be activated remotely, or macgyver a trap out of what he had with him in here… For instance, with these books, he could...Izuku stood and paced with his chin perched on his hand, continuing to mutter aloud to himself as he became distracted by his tangent. Suddenly, he became aware of an uncomfortable prickling on the back of his neck.
  Someone was watching him. 
Deku whirled around the room, paranoia itching under his skin, until he spotted the only possible offender: a small plush rabbit that was sitting at the foot of his bed, like a child’s favorite toy waiting patiently to be picked up and played with again. Izuku stared at it, trying to process the fact that the League of Villains had left something like this for him, and failing.Its beady little eyes stared unassumingly back.Unseen by Deku, a familiar pudgy man ducked away from the viewing slot on the door before he was spotted. He rubbed his weathered hands together in glee at successfully locating the boy’s cell, then made his way quickly down the corridor towards the lab. He had many preparations to make now that he finally knew where his newest subject was being kept, after all.The boy shook his head and ran a hand through his curly hair, feeling stressed all over again. It was just a toy, but the fact that they thought it was an appropriate gift for their teenaged kidnap victim proved without a doubt that the people he was dealing with here were...not all in their right minds, moral differences or no.He had to remain vigilant. Now that he thought on it, they could’ve bugged the room somehow and heard everything he’d muttered aloud just now. Just because he didn’t see any cameras mounted on the wall didn’t mean there weren’t any there…His eyes roamed the cell anxiously as he scanned for any sign of surveillance devices before shaking his head at himself, exasperated. He should stop overthinking things and just get on with it. The best thing he could do right now was to learn more about his prison, and that meant testing for weaknesses and looking for bugs.Deciding to get the former out of the way first, Izuku walked to the far wall of the cell where the door was, intending to do a relatively gentle testing strike against the wall; he didn’t want to punch through it yet, just gauge the strength of the brick to see if he could do so at all.He took a deep breath, wound back a fist, and summoned up a paltry 2% of his power to pound the wall with the side of his fist.One For All did not come.All the air left his lungs as Izuku felt like he’d been sucker-punched in the gut. It was as though the world had stopped spinning. Everything crawled to a halt and narrowed down to his clenched, non-glowing fists as he stood staring at them uncomprehendingly, trying to understand why the familiar rush of power wasn’t flowing through his veins. Slowly, he forced himself to exhale the shaky breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding and try again, reaching inside for the familiar buzz of power that should be swelling within.
  Nothing.
Izuku plunged fully into icy panic.How? How was this possible?! He hadn’t consented to passing on One For All, he would never have willingly given it up to the villains, but yet-! Had Shigaraki somehow- had he found a way to forcefully take-?!“No. No... No, no! Nononononono… !! ”Izuku’s voice pitched up hysterically as he frantically began to beat his fists against the wall as though he’d been buried alive, trying desperately to summon something, anything from One For All. Nothing came, not even a wisp of strength, and tears began rolling down his face as Izuku slammed his fists harder against his unyielding enclosure. Pure, unrelenting terror stampeded through him, and his attacks became more and more panicked and sloppy. Finally, one blow glanced the wall just enough, and the device on his wrist hit and bounced hard off the solid brick. For a split second, there was a hair of space between his wrist and the underbelly of the cuff, and the tingling sensation against his wrist lifted.Immediately, his body was bursting painfully with tentacles and power as Black Whip and One For All responded overenthusiastically to his call. They were there for only a fraction of a second, before disappearing once again. What…? Where did-...The device.Understanding finally hit him like a hammer between the eyes: this was a quirk suppression device. So long as the underbelly of the cuff was touching his skin, he would be rendered completely quirkless. One For All was still with him, of course, he simply couldn’t access it while the cuff was operational.The green indicator light twinkled mockingly up at him.Izuku sniffled weakly and wiped away his tears, upset and embarrassed that his enemies may have seen his moment of weakness but deeply, deeply thankful that his quirk hadn’t somehow been stolen away in his sleep.He held up his arm again and considered the offending device with puffy, critical eyes; despite the fact that he’d been slamming it hard into a wall just now, it seemed almost entirely undamaged. There wasn't even a dent! He almost couldn't believe what he was being restrained with; tech like this was still highly experimental, and wasn’t supposed to be widely distributed until several years from now. Where on earth had the League of Villains gotten ahold of it…?Deku shook his head with a sigh as he stood, clearing his thoughts and focusing again. For the moment, he’d leave the device be; right now, he should get back to reconnaissance, and the next best thing to do would be to check for surveillance devices.Izuku began to meticulously comb every inch of his cell that he could reach, hoping to get done before anyone came by to check on him. The boy was unaware still that a certain doctor had already done so when he hadn't been looking, or that the man was currently in a medical suite, laying out his best scalpels.Just for him.

    Chapter Text
    A set of footsteps came trudging down the basement stairs, two at a time. Daruma Ujiko lifted his head from the equipment he was cleaning to see Shigaraki descending into the lab, presumably to come check up on him. Ah, perfect timing! He was almost set up and ready to go. His sensei’s chosen successor nodded politely and greeted, “Hello, doctor. Good to see you’ve gotten your lab set up so quickly.” He turned to examine what Ujiko was working on, and asked, “What’s all this for?” as he gestured to the medical tools being laid out alongside the empty gurney, as they always were when he was preparing to start a new project. “Do I need a day one patch, since I’m technically still in beta?” Ujiko smiled fondly at the usual gaming-related lingo. Ah, the boy thought this was all for himself.“Oh, no Tomura-kun. You were pulled out a little early, yes, but with some minor adjustments you’ll be right as rain in no time.” He was quick to reassure him. “This, however, isn’t for you. It’s for that boy you brought in, Midoriya! Believe it or not, he used to be a patient of mine, back when Sensei would have me work as a pediatrician to keep a lookout for fresh quirks and subjects to take.” He turned from Shigaraki as he said this, making sure the scalpels were laid out neatly in order of size as he continued, “It’s amazing, really! I examined him personally when he was four, and as far as I could tell, the child was quirkless, toe bone and all. Imagine my shock when he came up on the screen during the sports festival with such a ferocious quirk!” he chuckled at the memory, “And even better, based on this ‘Black Whip’ that seems to have shown up out of nowhere, I don’t believe his power is just super strength; it may be the manifestation of quirks themselves! A quirk that is to generate new quirks! Imagine! ” His voice raised to an excited shout at the last word, and he took a moment to clear his throat self-consciously.It had been so long since he was this excited for the creation of a new child; these past few months, he had been so wholly focused on overseeing Shigaraki’s development, he hadn’t had time for anything else. While it had been a stimulating and unique treat, he was rather eager to wrap it up and get back to making some of his more usual types of creations. When he’d seen Shigaraki had brought Izuku Midoriya into the League’s custody, he had wanted to jump with joy at getting the chance to work with such a unique specimen.It was a fitting reward for all the hard work he’d put in for his new master these past three months, afterall.He snapped on his favorite rubber gloves and returned blithely to the conversation at hand,“Ever since, I’ve just been dying to get my hands on him. Such a wonderful power! And, if we combine it with a good regeneration or shock negation quirk, I think we can have something really, truly special on our hands!”He was a little embarrassed to say he was rushing a bit, like a freshman in college jumping into his first big lab, but he found he couldn’t help himself; he’d been bouncing on his toes with glee all morning, and now he was so close! He just couldn’t wait to get started. “Now, can you please come with me for a moment to help retrieve the boy? I’m finally ready to get started prepping him for the procedure!”Ujiko gripped the gurney, ready to wheel it out to Midoriya’s cell as he turned to his young master with an excited grin, expecting it to be returned in a reflection filled with gleeful malice.Instead, Shigaraki was standing frozen where he’d greeted the doctor by the stairs, staring at him with an unfamiliar intensity that made his hair stand on end and his hackles rise. “T-Tomura-kun…?” Shigaraki didn’t respond immediately, and stood very tense and still as he stared down the doctor for several long, uncomfortable moments. Ujiko felt rather like a magpie being cornered by a dragon whose hoard he’d foolishly stumbled into. A bead of sweat trickled down the doctor’s age-weathered neck, and he swallowed as he very slowly reached a shaking hand for the nearest scalpel.“…No. We’re not using him for that.” Shigaraki finally replied softly but with a firm note of finality, before sweeping out without another word.Daruma Ujiko remained frozen in place for over a minute before he finally allowed himself to breathe....Maybe he should work those kinks out of Tomura-kun’s system first, after all.The mission was an absolute success. Clean, in and out, a quick exchange of goods and money with a smooth extraction. Even better, the fools hadn’t even looked twice at their disguises, much less considered ratting them out to the heroes. All in all, Dabi was quite pleased with how everything had panned out.Carrying the spoils of their victory in their arms, Dabi and Mr. Compress spread their loot carefully across the old oak table in the war room, just in time for everyone to begin trickling in for the midday meeting their leader had called. “How did the pickup go?” Spinner asked as he peeked inside one of the small cardboard containers to check on the product waiting inside, and Mr. Compress replied, “Perfectly. Nobody suspected a thing of us.” He then produced a small dinner bell from one of his marbles and gave it a little ring, announcing, “Lunch is served, one and all! Come and get it.”Dabi snatched up his own box of lo mein before it could be lost amid the chaos of shuffling boxes and hungry teammates, and found a seat perched backwards on one of the many hastily-assembled mixmash of chairs scattered around the room. It wasn't that crowded at the base yet, thankfully; their allies would be arriving sometime later that week after throwing off the heroes' scent, so it was just the original members of the League of Villains hanging around for the moment.He didn’t bother standing on ceremony and immediately dug in, ignoring the small smatterings of casual chatter that broke out among the villains as they waited for their leader to arrive and start the meeting officially. Toga was uncharacteristically silent as she picked morosely at her food, staring sadly at the empty chair across from her.Eventually, Shigaraki walked in and began perusing the orders. He’d insisted on getting the one finger food they had on the menu; apparently, the guy was ecstatic about being able to eat with his hands without having to use his bad hand or worry about dusting it, and Dabi had to roll his eyes at his leader’s ridiculous antics. He may be a little cooler and more powerful now, but he was still Shigaraki under that flowing cape and phenomenal hair.Oddly, instead of picking a box and sitting down to eat, however, Shigaraki chose two and set them both aside. He took a seat by Dabi at the head of the table and stared intently at the ground with a clenched jaw, knee bouncing impatiently, and Dabi wondered what could have come up to agitate Shigaraki so much when’d been so cheerful just this morning. Had the heroes sniffed them out already or something?One by one, everyone else filed in and turned to their leader as they ate. He finally stood, slapped on a grin, and began to speak,“So… welcome to Fort Soga, or as we’re now calling it, Headquarters. As I’m sure you’ve all noticed, it’s an abandoned military outpost the government forgot about, so it’s a perfect place to settle in after such a successful strike against the heroes.” Here he paused, and his gaze was full of pride as it swept the room and met the eyes of everyone in it, one by one. “Again, as I said this morning in the mess hall, well done everyone! We made a massive leap forwards yesterday, and I couldn’t have done it without all of you and the sacrifices you’ve made, least of all our fallen comrade, Twice. May he rest in peace.” They held a somber moment of silence broken only by Toga’s quiet, unhappy sigh as she swiped more tears out of her eyes.After an appropriate amount of time had passed, Shigaraki nodded and continued, “...Moving on. We have a lot to discuss going forward now, but first I have a very important announcement to make, so I’ll jump straight to the point.”He looked around seriously at everyone, making sure he had their attention, and continued, “…Yesterday, early on in the battle, I captured a UA student who you all know I’ve always had an eye on; previously, I’d given orders to kill him by any means necessary.” The doctor fidgeted unhappily in his seat, a strange sight considering how creepily bouncy he had been at the mere mention of the kid a few hours ago. Where was Shigaraki going with this…?“I rescind those previous orders. Nobody is to touch him, and no experiments are to be done on him. Understand? From now on, we will do our best to make him one of our own, and that means treating him as… as family. Like a little brother.”A stunned silence filled the room. Dabi set his empty container aside and leaned forward in his seat, suddenly understanding the doctor’s sour mood and feeling intrigued that his theory on the flight over may have been right afterall. Why else would he have such a huge change of heart?After a beat, Mr. Compress hesitantly raised his hand and asked, “... Uh, If I may, why is the boy here then, if not to convert him into a noumu or kill him? Our last little ‘recruit ’ was rather difficult and hardly worth the effort, after all.”For a moment, Shigaraki seemed to flounder, caught off guard by his question. His face reddened somewhat, as if realizing he’d made some sort of embarrassing error, and his jaw opened and closed twice before he stammered out lamely, “Well, uh… he’s… He has… potential.”Mr. Compress removed his mask to reveal he'd quirked a brow. “... That’s it?”Shigaraki let out an agitated sigh through his teeth and raked a hand through his radiant hair. “...No, not quite…” He hedged, obviously buying time to come up with something his underlings would find acceptable. “Master,  please. Why not let me turn him into an asset for you? He truly would make such an  excellent  candidate…” The doctor wheedled, the very picture of a wrongfully kicked dog.Shigaraki looked visibly uncomfortable now, and from how close he was, Dabi could see the sweat that was starting to bead on his brow. Still, he couldn’t help himself; how often did he get the chance to tease Shigaraki like this?“Yeah, and it would really fuck up the heroes to know we did that to one of the kids they couldn’t protect.” He sadistically added, grinning a little as he watched his boss squirm.Shigaraki was starting to look panicked, and sputtered, “W-Well, yeah it would! Except, uh-” The leader of the villains was shifting nervously from one foot to the other now, looking very much like he regretted not thinking this conversation through beforehand.Spinner gripped his chin thoughtfully and spoke again, “Although, he was the one that Stain wanted to spare, right?”Oh, fine. This was a good enough out, and he was starting to somehow take pity on the man who’d effortlessly wiped out a chunk of the city yesterday. “Are we going to train him as some kind of recruiter to bring in new members, as someone affiliated with Stain and all?” Dabi asked with a long-suffering sigh.Shigaraki brightened immediately and sent the dark-haired villain a winning smile and a snap of his fingers, as though he’d simply been looking for the best way to word it. “Yes! Exactly.  Recruiter was the word I was looking for! Thank you, Dabi.”The fire user didn’t bother hiding his eye roll. Yeah, sure it was. Mercifully, everyone else seemed to have bought it. A few, like Spinner, even seemed to approve. “Oh wait, he’s THAT kid too, isn’t he? The one who took out  Muscular by  himself? I hate to cut off his path to true heroism, but we could really use that kind of brute strength on the team!” Even Toga seemed to perk up a little, a tiny smile appearing on her lips and some of that old, maniacal sparkle returning to her eyes.“Yes,” Shigaraki continued amid the murmuring, “We’re intending to bring him on as one of our own for this reason. I know Stain was what brought many of you on in the first place, and since the Paranormal Liberation Front’s numbers have unfortunately dwindled somewhat since the battle, we need to start bringing in more like-minded folk to the team. Who better to bring them in than an ex-hero approved by Stain himself? And, indeed, think of what a crippling blow that would serve to the heroes, to know that one of their own has betrayed them so completely! Hahaha!” The white-haired man crowed sadistically with a cackle.What the hell? May as well strike while the iron was hot. “I think we should do some research on the kid before trying to sweet talk him into switching sides, though,” Dabi interjected quickly, “Find what ideals and hardships we can tug his heartstrings with, and shit.” As well as whatever’s got Shigaraki so keen on him, of course. He won’t be seen as quite as much of a nutjob if he’s not the only one nosing around, after all. “Dabi, you’re on a roll today! The way I see it, we’re going to be laying low for a while as we wait for all this noise to die down, anyways. We should watch what the heroes do and plan our next move accordingly. In the meantime, I would like us to train, acquire resources, and focus on bringing little Izuku into the fold. I want us to get it right this time, unlike with that Bakugou brat! Sound good?”A chorus of agreements went up from the villains, and Shigaraki seemed to breathe a subtle sigh of relief.“What if we can’t turn him?”Shigaraki turned to Spinner, and smiled a very secretive smile. “Oh, we will. I’m not giving up this time, and if the hunch I have about him is correct, it may be easier to bring him in than you’d think. Now that that’s settled, let’s move on to...” As their leader spoke about some of the finer details in setting up their base, Dabi watched the doctor become more and more deflated and dejected as he came to terms with the fact that he wasn’t going to get a new toy to play with, after all. In contrast, Toga had cheered up a little for the first time since they’d arrived at the base, and Dabi wondered if he could sneak her in a visit with her crush; even if Shigaraki had ordered otherwise, the brat would probably be fine with just a mild stabbing. Poor girl certainly needed the pick-me-up, with how down she’s been about losing her best friend. ...Not that he cared, or anything. These people were nothing but tools to him.To Shigaraki’s enormous relief, the meeting was rather dull from that point onward.After figuring out Gigantomachia’s living arrangements, Twice’s funeral ceremony, when they were regrouping with the others, and what to put on the shopping list, the League’s first big meeting in their new fortress home finally came to a close. He truly was immensely thankful to Dabi for giving him such a good out. He would have hated having to awkwardly explain why they shouldn’t torture his new little brother or take away his humanity, despite having no solid evidence on his theory why. He shuddered at the memory of his previous conversation with the doctor; that man could be truly deadset on a project once he set his heart on it, and if he’d walked in just a few hours later than he did...Tomura shook his head to clear it of the ghastly images parading through at what could have been, and instead turned his thoughts back to his rather embarrassing start to the meeting.His reasonings had seemed so clear in his head when he’d made the decision to scoop the boy up and take him home in the moment, but standing in front of his underlings and trying to say it aloud, he’d suddenly felt ridiculous and insane. For now, he would hold off on telling them the truth until some good, solid proof surfaced. ‘If any proof surfaces…’  whispered that nagging hunger in the back of his brain. Shigaraki shoved it down irritably; he was not going to try and take Izuku’s quirk by force or go out of his way to antagonize him, not this time. When the time came and his brother had accepted his place among them, Tomura would simply trade him for something he preferred in his new arsenal of quirks and that would be that. Maybe even go out and get him something nice, as a treat. Something fun, like Flight or Telepathy! The thought of going on a sunny midday flight with his brother after a fun day of ruining the heroes together brought a small smile to his face.Shigaraki felt very proud of how well he’d done these past few months. He felt like a whole new man, reborn and revitalized. He’d had those awkward hiccups with that Overhaul bastard and his initial encounters with the MLA, sure, but in the end, he took it all in stride. He couldn’t wait to reunite with Sensei after the rescue and bask in his praise at how much he’d grown since their separation. Assuming, of course, he wasn’t completely taken in by his son.A hot pang of jealousy shot through him at the thought. No, no; Sensei would acknowledge him first. He was the one he’d hand-picked, after all.Shigaraki picked up his own barely touched box of food (his appetite had evaporated upon hearing the doctor’s... comments, despite having been ravenous mere seconds before) as well as Izuku’s and made his way to the kid’s room. As he walked, he distantly wondered to himself what Ujiko had meant when he said toe bones had something to do with quirks.He knew some people could have an extra one, but he never really thought anything of it. To him, it was like being double-jointed or missing the palamaris longus in the wrist; a little strange, but ultimately harmless. If anything, he found it rather fitting that Izuku had an extra toe joint.After all, he had one too.Humming a half-remembered tune from a time long passed, Shigaraki cheerfully set off for the detention block to enjoy lunch with his new “recruiter”.
        Notes:
          It's a good thing Dabi's curiosity compelled him to pull Shigaraki out of the metaphorical fire. His glorious leader didn't exactly look before he leaped, did he? XDNext chapter, our boys finally meet face to face and speak. Took quite awhile to get to this point, didn't it? :,)Comments and kudos appreciated. Thank you for reading! &lt;3

    Chapter Text
    It had been a few hours since he’d awoken, and Izuku had found no sign of bugs, traps, or suspicious goings on otherwise about his cell or the various items littered within. By now, he’d given up searching and had moved on to trying to find what use he could get out of his "gifts" as far as an escape attempt would go. The teen froze from where he’d been kneeling on the floor sorting through the book pile when he heard footsteps echoing down the hall. Someone was coming.Forcing himself to stay calm, he took deep, steadying breaths as he slowly straightened and turned stiffly to stare at the door as whoever it was come closer and closer, hoping against hope that they would pass his cell and continue on down the hall.No such luck.The sound of a heavy lock tumbling open rang deafeningly throughout the previously silent cell like a warning bell, and Izuku’s pounding heart jumped into his throat as he quickly improvised the best weapon he could think of in here-one of the more heavy books, held in front of him to act as a shield- and scrambled to his feet, creeping to the far corner of his cell. His entire body was tightly wound and ready to put up a fight, quirkless or not. No reason to make whatever they planned for him easy, after all.Dread filled his being as the cell door swung open to reveal Shigaraki balancing two small, nondescript cardboard boxes in one hand and juggling the keys and door in the other. He entered, spun quickly to shut the door behind himself and relock it, before slowly turning to look over his shoulder and peer with delight at his prisoner.He smiled. “Hello, Izuku.”The young hero bared his teeth like a cornered animal, and pressed his back harder against the wall, clutching his makeshift shield tightly. “Shigaraki.” he hissed.The villain in question seemed more offended than threatened by his show of hostility, and actually rolled his eyes at him as he ventured further into the boy’s unwilling residence. “Oh, calm down. I’m not going to hurt you.” he scoffed as he set both boxes of what appeared to be takeout on the side table, next to the untouched apple. “I’m just bringing you lunch.”“Why not use the food tray slot, then?” Izuku asked suspiciously, edging further down the wall and away from his captor cautiously.“Because, I want to talk to you. C’mere a sec, kid.” So saying, he sat on the cot and patted the spot next to him, as if he sincerely expected Izuku to willingly be within arm’s reach of him for any reason less than avoiding certain death.Izuku gave him one of his best hero smiles to hide the terror racing through his veins and replied, “I’m good here, thanks,” voice tight with false courtesy.Shigaraki gave him a look of mild concern at the strange grimace adorning his face, and sighed, “Alright, suit yourself then.” He leaned back on his hands and gazed up at the ceiling as he paused a moment, as if carefully wording what he was about to say next.Izuku ripped off the bandaid himself, knuckles white around the novel. “The answer is, and will always be, no.”“What?” Shigaraki turned to him, head still tilted backwards, brow furrowed with a frown of confusion.“You  can’t  have it.”Something in his enemy’s eyes darkened as he straightened up to stare at him, and Izuku felt his blood run cold. All at once, the nightmares he’d had of masters being ripped away from their wailing successors and the gore-stained battlefields of two centuries past made a deeper instinct in him cry out to stay away from this man. He fought the urge to take a hand off the book and clutch at his chest as anxiety flooded through him. Then Shigaraki’s face cleared, and the moment passed as the villain shook his head and looked down to the floor while leaning forward onto his knees with a sigh.“...No, little guy. Believe it or not, that’s not why I brought you here.”Despite his words, Izuku didn’t miss how his hands had twitched for a moment at the mention of taking his quirk.The boy swallowed painfully to wet his suddenly bone-dry throat, and hoarsely asked, “Then why AM I here? What else could you possibly want from me, if not to-to steal my quirk?” He knew what else there could be, of course, but he was still hesitant to really believe he’d be given such a merciful “offer”, not when Shigaraki had despised him so much before.Shigaraki didn’t say anything for a moment as he chewed his lip, before straightening up and reaching for the boxes of food next to him. “...Why don’t we have a bite to eat while we talk about this?”“I’m not hungry.” Izuku stayed right where he was.“Yeah, you are. You skipped dinner and probably lunch as well yesterday, and barely even nibbled the snack I left for you. Come  here .” Black branch-like tendrils sprouted from the tips of Shigaraki’s fingers just like the ones All For One had used in Kamino, and Izuku used everything he had to control the panic that lanced through him like a gunshot. Quickly, he brought up his makeshift shield to try and block the oncoming attack, but caught nothing; the tentacles didn’t swing for him as he’d expected, and instead snaked tamely and patiently around his defenses to grab him by his wrists, despite his best efforts to scramble back and knock them away. The book clattered from his hands as another set clamped onto his ankles, and Izuku let out an undignified, frightened shriek as he was forcibly dragged in and plopped down next to his enemy.Shigaraki gently put a hand on his back as if to steady him as he landed, and Izuku flinched away hard and unconsciously clutched the box of food that had just been thrust into his hands to his chest protectively. “Don’t- don’t you-!”“Hey now, relax. You’re going to spill, at this rate.” He scolded lightly as he withdrew the appendages, like he was telling a little kid not to play with his food at dinner instead of reprimanding a terrified teen hostage for cringing away after being yanked across the room by his captor. The man used a pair of chopsticks to force the box down from where it was flush against Izuku’s chest before stabbing them into whatever was inside and leaving them there. He then grabbed his own box and began to dig barehanded into his sushi with gusto. Izuku sat frozen for a moment, breath coming hard and fast as he stared at the maniac next to him. Feeling stunned, he decided it would be best to choose his battles wisely and began to shakily dig into whatever he had been brought. Chicken katsudon… almost his favorite.Shigaraki happily popped the sushi from his own box into his mouth without antagonizing him further, and they fell into a strangely zen silence. Izuku stared numbly at his decidedly not tampered with meal as he tried to wrap his head around the surreality of his situation and figure out what the hell was going on. Was Kacchan also made to endure this kind of insanity?Izuku was so confused. Every other time they’d met, Shigaraki had shown nothing but malice and contempt for him, and would have clearly preferred killing or maiming him to... this, all the way up to halfway through their last encounter. At the very least, he was expecting some mocking remarks for such a humiliatingly easy capture, but Shigaraki was either really committing to reeling him in despite his animosity, or...something truly had changed his mind about him in that last battle. What could it have been?“...Why am I here?” the boy asked softly, letting his chopsticks rest limply in his half-eaten meal.“Hwah?” Came the dignified response from the leader of the villains as he turned to his captive with bulging cheeks. Flowing ethereal hair and deluxe tank makeover or no, he was still that strange, slobbish man he’d met at USJ somewhere under the new grace and power he’d acquired. He swallowed, and asked again, “Sorry, what? I missed that.”Izuku was getting tired of playing these games. He grit his teeth and growled out, “Why am I here? Why are you trying to play nice with me when we both already know what you want? I’m not going to give my quirk to you just because you’re pretending to be my friend.” Izuku’s heart was hammering against his ribs, and despite his words, he prayed he didn’t just convince the villain to wheel out the torture devices. Though, maybe, that would be preferable to waiting for the hammer to drop.Is that what this was? Some strange form of psychological warfare, a way to get in his head?Shigaraki stopped eating, staring into his own meal for a second before sighing and setting it aside. He clasped his hands together and rested his chin against his interlaced fingers as he stared seriously at the other side of the cell. With a numb horror, Izuku noticed for the first time that his left arm had been totally mutilated and that several fingers were missing. What was the story behind that…?“I want to tell you…” Shigaraki spoke abruptly, “But, I don’t think you’d believe me. Not yet, anyways.” Izuku blinked in confusion.“What? Why would it matter if I believed you?” Izuku cocked his head to the side in puzzlement, and Shigaraki’s gaze softened as it turned to him. He brought his good hand up to ruffle the young hero’s hair, and chuckled when Izuku squawked indignantly and frantically ducked away. “Don’t you worry about it, ‘zucchini. I’ll tell you once I have some good, solid proof so you don’t think I’m crazy.”Deku's face scrunched at the bizarre, incredibly unwelcome nickname. “That’s- don’t call me that. And besides, I already think you’re crazy! You may as well tell me now anyways.” He might be pressing his luck with such a demanding tone, but Izuku didn’t care; he was dying to know what he could expect to happen to him.Shigaraki let out a long-suffering sigh that didn’t really feel all that annoyed, and replied, “Listen, all you need to know is that we’re not gonna hurt you. If you really want to know more that badly, though… Well, that information’ll cost ya.” the villain finished with a sly grin.Izuku paled. Of course, of course he would use information as a bargaining chip. What could Deku possibly be expected to offer up in exchange? Villainous deeds? Crucial information on his friends? Weaknesses in UA or the agencies he interned for? His heart raced as a million possibilities crashed through his head like a waterfall, each more horrific than the last, until he finally looked up to catch the amused twinkle in Shigaraki’s eyes as they darted down to his katsudon then back up to meet his gaze.He was being toyed with again.Izuku almost screamed with irritation, but managed to force it down to a low snarl as he thrust the remains of his meal into the supervillain’s lap, being careful to avoid his hands all the while. Shigaraki laughed quietly at him as he accepted the sacrifice, and Izuku crossed his arms and turned away so his enemy couldn't see his cheeks flush with embarrassment, hunching his shoulders to hopefully hide his reddening ears as well.“Aw, don’t pout, ‘zuku.” Shigaraki cooed from behind a mouthful of rice and chicken, amusement dripping from his tone. “You held up your end of the bargain, so I’ll hold up mine.”Izuku felt a stab of irritation at the gall he had to use his first name again, before perking up at the criminal’s words. It had...worked? He turned to peer curiously over his shoulder as Shigaraki finished chewing his bite. He had been serious about that after all, then…?Shigaraki swallowed his mouthful of Izuku’s meal and stared at the floor intensely with a furrowed brow, thinking carefully on his words again, “You bear a…special resemblance… to someone very important to me. I have a hunch about you, about where you  came from  and I… I need to make sure you’re safe, just in case I’m right.”Izuku snorted in disbelief at what he’d been offered, and replied, “So, you kidnapped me NOT to steal my quirk or turn me into one of your horrific abominations, but rather because I remind you of a friend of yours? And now, you want to wrap me in bubblewrap on the off chance I am indeed related to them, despite how often you’ve tried to kill me in the past?”“Yes. Exactly.”The man who had dissolved several city blocks just yesterday stared at him with absolute severity, and Izuku realized that he wasn’t joking. He was serious.Izuku’s jaw dropped. Shigaraki had taken him away… to protect him? From what? And who could possibly be so important to him that he would set aside his personal vendetta against Izuku and hero society at large on the off chance that killing him would hurt their feelings? ‘You know who,’ something in the back of his mind whispered, but Izuku shoved it down without much consideration. No. Shigaraki may be insane, but even he’s not that crazy.Now, it was the villain’s turn to snort. “Told you so. You don’t believe me, do you?”A strong, spidery hand landed on his shoulder and Izuku jumped about a foot in the air as he was jolted out of his dark musings, as Shigaraki merrily continued, “From now on, we’re considering you family, little brother! Regardless of what you have waiting for you out there, of what you think is waiting for you out there, myself and the rest of the Paranormal Liberation Front are here for you now. You’re going to stay safely tucked away here with us, where nothing can harm you and where you cannot bring any more harm to yourself. You’re with your true family, now. Understand, Izuku?” He was staring seriously at him, imploring the young hero to understand.Izuku didn’t understand at all. “I don’t think- well, I’m not-” he stammered for a moment, before chewing his lip nervously and hesitantly asking, “What if… it turns out I’m not who you think I am?”Shigaraki stared for a moment, before giving him a smile that stretched just a hair too wide. One that set his teeth on edge and made him feel like a fly caught under a cup. “...Don’t worry about it. You’re still my family, now. I won't be losing you to the heroes, again." Again...?“.... Ah. I see.” Izuku answered quietly, shifting nervously in his seat. Something about the unhinged possessiveness in Shigaraki’s eyes when he’d said that wasn’t all that reassuring.“...Anyways,” Shigaraki sighed and finally removed his hand mercifully from the boy’s shoulder as he stretched his arms over his head and continued nonchalantly, “you’ll see things our way at some point or another. Everything will work out just fine, eventually.” Shigaraki stood with a yawn as he spoke, and began gathering the remains of their food. “Are you done with this, or do you want to keep the leftovers in here? I can keep it in the fridge, if you’d like. Oh, you still need a trashcan as well, don’t you…” He trailed off with a murmur.“N-no, thank you… Hey wait, don’t leave yet!” Izuku's manners took over on autopilot as he struggled to keep up with the abrupt change in atmosphere, before standing and making as if to follow Shigaraki to the door as the man strode to the exit; he had more questions than answers now, dammit!The elder boy smiled at him, gentle and warm, and Izuku was so stunned by the sincere fondness radiating from his gaze that it stopped him in his tracks. “Don’t worry, Izuku. I’ll be back later tonight to bring you dinner. Tell me if you think of anything else you need in here by then, 'kay?” He said warmly, without a drop of condescension or mockery. Then, with a final ruffle to the teen's hair, he exited the cell and meandered back down the hall.Izuku stood there for a moment more, mouth hanging agape for the second time that afternoon, before he finally picked his jaw back up and collapsed into the cot again. He slung an arm over his eyes and groaned as he tried to process the despair, anxiety, and outright confusion surging through him at all these strange new developments.What kind of mess had he gotten himself into?All things considered, that had gone quite well.Shigaraki put the leftovers away in the fridge and set off to continue his rounds, intending to check on how Gigantomachia’s quarters were coming along next.For the most part, Izuku had been calm and civil. He’d only needed to restrain him once! The fact that he hadn’t immediately come at him swinging was a very encouraging sign, almost better than he could’ve hoped for.Though, a small part of him was a little disappointed Izuku hadn’t been warmer with him. Sternly, he pushed it down; Shigaraki reminded himself that at the moment, Izuku didn’t understand that he’d been living a lie up until now, that those he most looked up to had, in fact, snatched him away from his true family as a small child for the sake of revenge, pride, and a warped sense of altruism.Of course, he could still be wrong about Izuku’s parentage; after all, he had no solid proof outside of his own observations. Even if this were the case, his more impressive qualities were enough to convince Tomura that he’d make a fine underling anyways. Perhaps, even, a second in command one day!He would take this slow, one step at a time. There was no need to rush; he had all the time he needed, after all.He had all the time in the world.
        Notes:
          Yes, Izuku. What kind of mess, indeed? c,:Kudos and comments appreciated. Thank you for reading! &lt;3

    All Might had thought he’d known emptiness before, when he’d grown up alone and quirkless in those dark years before UA. He thought he’d known terror when he truly fought All For One for the first time, and been forced to stand against him on his own.He thought he’d known loss when Nana had been taken from him.None of those, not  one  of those compared to the sadistic ball of emotion that had been writhing in his chest since the news had reached him. Nothing could be worse than what he was feeling now.Nothing, perhaps, except the conversation he was currently having with Young Midoriya’s mother.Inko Midoriya sat quietly in front of him with her hands folded in her lap, still and quiet as a grave as he informed her of her son’s kidnapping and the circumstances behind it. He almost wished she’d burst into hysterics instead, so he’d at least know how to comfort her; anything would be better than the look of numb horror, acceptance, and  guilt on her face as she stared down unseeingly at the two cups of cooling tea sitting untouched on the coffee table between them.“You said you’d protect him from these kinds of situations, All Might. You  promised .”Toshinori flinched. The blow that took his lung had hurt less. “... I was not a part of the group that made the decision to send him out. I wasn’t even aware that there was an operation of that scale underway; had I been, I would not have stood for the hero commission’s decision to send  high school students out to assist in such a dangerous raid.”He bowed his head somberly and went on, “However, as his mentor, I am taking full responsibility for Young Midoriya’s safety, and am doing everything in my power to get him back.” To say that the higher-ups had been irresponsible and rash in their reasoning was a gross understatement,  especially  with everything that had happened between the children and the League of Villains this past year… Truly, what had they been thinking?“So, the ones who decided to send my Izuku into a warzone are the ones in charge? God…” A hand came up to cover her mouth in horror as she looked away.The retired hero took a sip of his tea as he tried to think of something more to say, anything to console her, something that wasn’t an  excuse  or an  I’m sorry , but nothing came. Finally, after floundering for a moment more, he tried, “...We truly are doing all we can to find him, Midoriya-san. All of our best are on the-”“All of the best are dead  or in critical care from the same massacre they sent my son into.” She broke through hollowly with a crack in her voice, lowering her hand and meeting his eyes.Yagi said nothing, just hung his head and raked a hand through his unkempt hair; it had barely been 24 hours since the incident, but the city, emergency services, and hero society as a whole were still reeling with chaos. Not only had they lost several good, brave heroes to the battle, several more had gone missing. Most disturbing of all, some had even lost their quirks.Somehow, the power of All For One was alive and well in Shigaraki Tomura.And now, his young successor was in his clutches.From the other room, a small explosion rattled the tiny apartment as Bakugou Katsuki’s cracked voice rose to a yell. The hoarse voice of his homeroom teacher spoke firmly over him, and both voices receded from his range of hearing as they began speaking at a regular volume again.Class 1-A had been absolutely crushed when they’d learned of their classmate’s abduction, evident in the pile of letters and gifts sitting on Mrs. Midoriya’s kitchen table. Eraserhead and Present Mic had been on the scene when it happened and taken it a little more personally, however. Aizawa was barely speaking to anyone outside of business anymore, and the radio star looked more gaunt and miserable than Toshinori had ever seen him. They had been scouring the underground networks and pulling in contacts without rest since the incident, desperate for some kind of miracle lead like the one that landed in their laps with Young Yaoyorozu’s brilliant tracking device, but so far all they had come up with were dead ends.It was rather concerning; All Might understood how they were feeling, he truly did, but the underground hero, in particular, should still be taking bed rest at the hospital. As far as Yagi knew, his escorting Young Bakugou to the Midoriya residence to force him to take a break from search-and-rescue operations was the first true rest Eraserhead had taken since this nightmare had begun.Then, there was Katsuki Bakugou... That young man blamed himself more than anyone else for what had happened to his rival, for allowing Deku to risk himself in such a way. He was trying so hard to put up a strong front despite the regret and frustration and guilt that was surely eating him alive, but All Might knew better than to let that fester this time. He had been keeping a close eye on the explosive boy; hazily, his thoughts drifted into their most recent conversation, when Young Bakugou had recounted to him the last anyone had seen of his precious student.Katsuki barreled over the rubble with his cobbled-together team, intent on hunting down Shigaraki before he escaped with the absolute imbecile who had decided to chuck him halfway across town.He wasn’t going to be responsible for another incident like Kamino. Not with that fucking loser!The hastily assembled rescue squad consisted of himself, half-n-half, Aizawa-sensei, Mic-sensei, and some old fart with a jetboot quirk who had insisted on coming along for some reason. It didn’t matter, the fight wouldn’t last long.They were almost to where stupid Deku had launched him like the ball from the first exam of their highschool career when suddenly, a villain leapt out at them from the shadows. Katsuki growled as a bolt of recognition ran through him; this was the dirtbag who had dragged him through the portal by his neck all those months ago at summer camp!A huge wall of blue flames blossomed from the ugly bastard’s outstretched hands. He didn’t blast them with it, but instead spread across the road behind him to block their way forward. The two-story tall blue-hot flames lit him from behind like a demon as he sneered, “Here to get your brat back, huh?”“Out of the way, asshole!” Katsuki roared as he made to lunge for the villain, but stopped himself short as Aizawa-sensei gave the signal to hold off. His teacher’s face twisted into a dark look of recognition and fury, and he stepped between his students and the flame wielder as he snarled, “Where is Deku?”The dark-haired criminal in front of them grinned maliciously and drawled, “Wouldn’t you like to know,  teacher? Hey, this feels familiar though, doesn’t it? Are you going to keep all your kids safe this time, or are you gonna fail them just like you did last summer?” His eyes locked with Bakugou’s as he taunted Aizawa-sensei, and the boy’s palms began to pop with preemptive explosions that were aching to be let out into that stupid, smug, crispy-looking face. “Will you be able to get him back before we get away, this time? I wonder. The kid we have now’s the one who messed up his arm in the sports festival, isn’t he? Be a real shame if we made that any worse.”Aizawa-sensei looked more murderous than Bakugou had ever seen him. For a moment, Katsuki was certain he was going to charge the flaming freak, but instead, Mic-sensei gave his shoulder a reassuring squeeze and whispered, “You guys go on ahead. I’ll hold hot stuff here back.”“Alright. Be careful.” Aizawa-sensei murmured, giving the hand on his shoulder a squeeze in return. He then darted down a side alley, giving the signal for the others to follow. Patchy made to cut them off, but was blasted back by one of Mic-sensei’s eardrum-shattering shrieks. “BAAAACK OFFFFF!”“I could’ve taken him,” Katsuki grumbled as he glanced over his shoulder to see his English teacher blocking another attempt to follow them. Would he be alright, fighting alone against a villain of that caliber? From the way half n half met his eyes with his own look of concern, he was clearly thinking the same. “We don’t have the luxury of a long drawn-out battle right now. We need to get to Midoriya-kun before things get too hairy and we’re forced to withdraw!” The old man explained, and they quickened their pace.It took several agonizing minutes of them racing through the alley system to come out into the ruins proper, and a few more to arrive where Katsuki had last seen Deku. Finally,  finally they managed to catch up.They had dispersed somewhat, but there was still a discouraging number of villains hanging around. Shigaraki was there as well, and was holding Deku by the back of his neck like a disobedient puppy. “Midoriya..!” Half-n-half cried, already stepping towards him.For a moment, just the briefest moment, Deku’s eyes locked with Bakugou’s own and filled with desperate hope at their arrival, before the villain in a tophat stepped closer and compressed him into a marble. The criminals then split into two groups, and as the one holding Deku’s marble disappeared into the rubble flanked by lackies, Shigaraki turned to look up at them. And smirked.Katsuki saw red. “Give him back, you bastards!!” he roared. Right at that moment, Endeavor and his squad showed up, and the grin dropped from Shigaraki’s face.“Perfect timing, Todoroki! Keep him back so we can rescue the kid!” Old fart called. Endeavor grunted an affirmative and began driving Shigaraki away from their group with a powerful barrage of attacks. Aizawa-sensei broke off to join him, and barked, “You three go on ahead, I’ll help contain Shigaraki!”“Yes sir!”No longer needing to keep pace with their slower members, Katsuki’s team rocketed out of the battlefield and quickly gained on the small cluster of villains. They seemed to be composed of minor fighters, and the only real threat appeared to be the one with the compression quirk holding Deku.Him, and the living mountain who turned to face them as they finally came within range for an attack.Bakugou grit his teeth as he braced himself for what would surely be an intense battle with the giant, only for Mount Lady to come bursting out from a plume of smoke and deck the monster in the face. She wrestled the thing back as it caught her arms, and called over her shoulder, “I’ve got this one! Go get that kid back!”Katsuki grinned sadistically as he turned to face his targets standing shocked between the pillars of their massive friend’s ankles; that just left the small fry. This should be easy pickings!The old man and Todoroki both peeled off to go around the battling giants and flank the kidnappers from either side as Katsuki rocketed himself high into the air. Taking advantage of the momentum of his fall, he began to spin wildly as he wound up to deliver a Howitzer Impact directly on top of the bastard who had Deku contained in one of his stupid bubbles.Only, he never made it that far. Out of nowhere, something black and heavy slammed into him and slapped him back down to earth as if he were nothing more than an annoying fly. His teeth rattled in his skull as he hit the ground so hard he bounced. As the teen struggled to his feet, he realized with dawning horror that it had been one of several noumu cutting himself and the others off, and that crawling out from behind the villains there were several…  dozen…“What? You didn’t think we’d make this easy for you, did you? Heroes?” Compress crowed gleefully like a performer midshow, half-turning to give the boy a mocking salute as he and his entourage began to make their escape through the rubble, laughing all the while.No. They’d come too close to give up now. Deku was right there, practically within his reach! He could still stop this from happening!Scrabbling to his feet with a snarl, Bakugou stubbornly charged the villains again, narrowly dodging a blow from a noumu with two mouths that would’ve pinned him to the ground. He dodged and weaved around the other villains and noumu in the chaos of the battle, and finally managed to slam Mr. Compress to the ground with one hand pinning his wrists and the other slapped over the side of his stupid mask. “Nobody move!” He roared, “Or I’ll give this loser a reason to keep his face covered!!” Reluctantly, the small fry stood down and called off the noumu that had been half a second away from pouncing the young hero. Not far behind them, the earth shook as the giants’ battle raged on, and walls of ice shot up as half n half finally managed to break away from the monsters and join him.The old geezer held back the rest, as they were too far to hear the call. He couldn’t buy them much time, but just a little was all they needed.Katsuki turned back to the villain whose shoulders he was kneeling on with a leer. Todoroki stepped closer and boldly demanded, “You’ve been defeated. Release Midoriya at once!” “Or else!” Katsuki jeered, letting a few mini-explosions pop off by the villain’s ear for emphasis.The criminal under his knee seemed to panic as he writhed fruitlessly for a moment, before heaving a heavy sigh. “Alright. Listen, I just-“ He was interrupted by a loud splash behind them.Katsuki turned in time to see a puddle of dark liquid splash to the ground where half n half had been just a moment earlier. He turned to lock wide eyes with the old man blasting across the battlefield to join him, only for him to be enveloped in dark sludge as well.“Heh. It appears you’ve lost your chance. Better luck next time, child.”Bakugou stared down at the calm, relieved face of the kidnapper in numb disbelief, just in time for a wave of horribly familiar sludge to burst up his throat and swallow him whole.Bakugou’s hands and knees slammed onto the ground as he coughed and gagged at the horrible taste lingering in his mouth. “What are you doing here?! Where is the rest of the rescue team?” Endeavor’s horrified voice rang out behind him. Endeavor. Who was supposed to be at least a mile behind them.A ragged gasp of horror left the teen as he looked up and realized where he was: all the way back where the main battle was taking place, far from the villains who had Deku in their grasp.Fuck, this was bad…!Shigaraki stood before him, beaming down with unhinged glee. “Woah now, that was close. Though, believe me, you won’t be taking him away again, heroes.”Wait… again?Far below the remains of the building they were on, the other heroes who had been chasing Shigaraki were now being completely swamped by noumu. A seriously toasted-looking Present Mic had caught up with the main group and was trying desperately to wade through the chaos with Aizawa-Sensei and head over to where Izuku’s captors had disappeared what felt like hours ago. “Shit, we’re losing ground!” “GET OUTTA OUR WAAAAAAAAY!!”The barely-disguised terror and urgency in his teachers’ voices was haunting. Had they reacted like this when he had been taken? Was this how it felt, to be on the other side of it? This awful, crushing desperation? And now, because he'd taken his stupid time gloating over the enemy instead of getting Deku out of that damned marble...Bakugou could only look on as the noumu overwhelmed his teachers, allies, and classmates, creating too much chaos for anyone to slip away. The still-battling giants looked so far away now, and with the smoke and dust rising from the war raging below they were starting to disappear entirely.He was running out of time…!Shigaraki’s cruel laughter chased him as he blasted across the battlefield, determined to regain lost ground and catch up to the group holding Deku again. Constantly, he was batted aside and stopped by the sea of villains and noumu alike, and Bakugou found himself struggling just to stay alive.Ultimately, he never found them again.Blinking, All Might came back to himself.Don’t think about it, Yagi. Focus on the here and now. Focus on what needs to be done. He regained his composure and picked back up on the conversation with his successor’s mother, “Yes, that is true. Many of our elite were injured or… incapacitated in the battle, and most of those who are available are busy helping out with the cleanup and rescue efforts.”He straightened and put on an optimistic, if somewhat weary, grin as he went on, “But rest assured, my name still has great weight in this community! I already have a detective I’d trust with my life on the case. I’ll bring together a team of the very best heroes, and we’ll start the search as soon as we can.” He leaned over the coffee table to rest a hand on where hers were folded in her lap, and put on his best reassuring hero smile. “We will find him. I will use all my strength to rescue Young Midoriya! That’s a promise!”She huffed out a short, dry chuckle, and pulled a hand out from where it was enveloped by his to wipe away the tears beading in her eyes before they could fall. “What does that promise mean? That you’ll depend on others as best you can to save him for you? You can’t swoop in to save him yourself, anymore, since you’re-”She gasped loudly, and clutched at her mouth as if to catch the words that had just spilled out and pull them back in. “I-I’m so sorry, that was very cruel of me to say! It’s just that, it’s just… ” She let out an exasperated sigh and stood to pace restlessly around the couch to the nearby wall hung with photos. Toshinori joined her, and placed what he hoped was a comforting hand on her shoulder. A solemn silence hung in the air as they both stared at a photo where a three-year-old Izuku was beaming out excitedly at them, posing heroically with his favorite All Might action figure clutched in his tiny fist.“It was all he wanted, you know? All he ever wanted was to be a hero, just like you. But being quirkless, he- All Might, he was so much more fragile than the other kids, it felt like. And when his quirk finally manifested he-  we were so happy. Finally, his dream could come true!” She paused to sniffle and wipe her eyes again as she turned to face him, despair overwhelming in her eyes. “Why is it, then, that killers have gravitated to him ever since he started going to that school? Why is it that I’ve gotten so many terrible calls from the hospitals, why is it that he’s this close to losing the use of his arm not even a year into his training?! This isn’t normal! Why is it always him, why do they always go after  my boy, All Might?” She finished choking on a sob, and he brought her into his arms as she finally broke down.…He had put this off long enough. It was time.Yagi steeled himself for the difficult conversation ahead, and began to speak softly into her ear, “Mrs. Midoriya… There’s something I need to tell you. Something I should have told you a long time ago.”Doctor Ujiko was not having the good day he’d anticipated that morning.The exciting new project that he’d so been looking forward to had been mercilessly yanked out from under him, and for what? A means to gain new members? They could do that well enough with people like Giran, or through their new allies. The old man growled with irritation, his mind made up. Well, then. He was just going to have to visit Shigaraki and set this right!He made his way briskly to his young master’s quarters, barely refraining from stomping the whole way there like a petulant child. He would talk him out of this grave misstep, he would make him see sense and understand that turning that child into an elite new High-End was the best way to go!He knocked on his young master’s door a little harder than intended, and an annoyed and bedraggled Tomura yanked the door open with a glare. “What is it, doctor? You woke me from my nap.”The memory of Tomura’s bizarre attitude shift just a few hours earlier came flooding back to knock the wind from his sails, so instead of boldly stating his demands as rehearsed in his head on the way over, Ujiko’s mouth hung open for half a second before he meekly stuttered, “M-may I come in? I’d like to speak with you for a moment.” Tomura gave him his grumbled assent, before nodding and grumpily stepping aside so the old man could enter his quarters. Ujiko shuffled in, then took a steeling breath. No backing out now, not over something as ridiculous as his nerves. This was for the boy’s sake just as much as his own.“Master, I-I  really  think you should reconsider your plans for Izuku Midor-” “Oh my GOD, not this again…” Shigaraki groaned and raked a hand down his face, clearly greatly annoyed despite this being the doctor’s first time asking. He hadn’t even heard him out! “Listen, we’re keeping him. That’s my final word on the matter. Now,  out  please, so I can finish my nap.” Shigaraki didn’t wait for a reply and began lazily nudging him towards the door with a bouquet of black tentacles that sprouted from his good hand.“W-wait, hold on now, I said WAIT!” The doctor caught the door frame before he could be fully ejected from the room, determined to say his piece even if he had to rustle up some theatrics for it. “I-I’ve been your loyal doctor for YEARS now, and all your new upgrades are thanks to ME! What have I done to deserve such cruelty? Won’t you at least give me an explanation as to  why ?!” He wailed with false dismay, blinking rapidly in the hopes of wetting his eyes. The gentle shooing stopped. “Haven’t I been good to you, Tomura-kun?” He finished sadly, giving the young man his best puppy dog eyes.A smidgeon of guilt pinched Tomura’s face, and he gently let him go before planting his hands firmly on the old man’s shoulders, giving a comforting squeeze. “I’m sorry, doctor, you’re right. I’ve been completely unfair to you, especially for all you’ve done for me recently. Forgive me.”“You are forgiven.” The doctor replied immediately, eager to get back to his point. Before he could get his hopes up, however, the young man continued, “But still, you can’t experiment on Izuku. He’s too… important.”His rising hopes were immediately dashed. “But then…  why? And, why the use of…?” Tomura was not one to use a first name basis so casually,  especially not with one he used to call an enemy not too long ago. What exactly was going on here?Shigaraki hissed through his teeth at the slip of the tongue as he sat on his bed, head in his hands. After a moment of deep contemplation, he met the old man’s gaze with a serious look in his eyes and asked, “Doctor Ujiko… can I trust you to keep a secret?”The old man’s fingers quivered as he dialed the number he’d memorized long, long ago into the emergency burner phone, still feeling numb and reeling with disbelief. Ujiko had been his master’s dear friend and confidant for the better part of a century, had even sacrificed his own flesh and blood for the cause. Surely, dear young Tomura was mistaken. There was just no way he would be kept out of the loop on something as significant as…  as…  Swallowing around a dry throat, he mashed the call button, praying he would pick up despite where he was. Telephone could be finicky quirk at the best of times, so for it to work from where his master was now…The line rang once, twice, five times... Before finally picking up.The familiar croon of All For One’s sonorous voice filled his ears like a warm breeze, despite the mildly disconcerted tone its owner was currently using. “Hello, Sensei.”“Hello, doctor. It’s good to hear you again, though I told you not to use this number unless the situation was critical. From last I heard, things seemed to be going very smoothly for Tomura-kun. To what do I owe the chat?”“Old friend… do you have any children?”Shigaraki yawned as he plopped down in the swivel chair at the tiny desk his room had come with, opened up his laptop, and got to work. May as well start poking through Izuku's records now, since he was too awake to slip back to sleep. He still had a couple of hours or so before dinner would be ready, anyways, and the other busywork he’d had planned for the evening could wait until tomorrow. Before he’d bid him a shaky farewell, the doctor had given him the information needed for Shigaraki to access his newest prospective member’s medical records. Tomura was very grateful for the help; it would be rather tragic if he killed his baby brother by mistake with a simple allergy or health complication, after all.It took a little while of jimmying with the security to find what he was looking for, but Shigaraki finally managed to break through to Izuku’s medical records.At first, it seemed pretty ordinary. No notable allergies or conditions, and the only incidents of note in his file were a broken ankle from a long fall when he was 5 and, of course, the extra toe joint Ujiko had mentioned. He scratched his nose idly as he stared at it, wondering at the significance. Perhaps he could ask Izuku later?As he clicked onto the more recent files, however, his hand froze on the mouse and all thought flew out the window. Everything ground to a halt as he stared at the various x-ray photos that seemed to glare accusingly at him from his screen.Izuku’s...  bones …It was as if someone had used them as a firecracker, lazily taped them back up, then done so again. And again. And again.The newspaper clipping he’d read reporting the boy had been hospitalized in the summer camp assault surfaced fuzzily in his memory. He’d known the boy had been injured in the attack, as well as in the sports festival previous to that, but…  this was…Guilt choked him like a physical sludge sliding down his throat. Shigaraki’s eyes darted down the page to the doctor’s notes, and felt his already chilled blood turn to ice. Just a few more breaks, and he would be…
   Shigaraki had always thought of his Sensei as invincible, a powerful and immovable pillar in his life that always knew what to do and how to do it. He was too clever, too perfect to ever be torn down in any capacity. 
 The thought of him being defeated, being   crippled   by some hero was as laughable as it was stupid. 
   And yet... 
   “He’s awake, finally. You can see him, Tomura-kun, but please take care to be quiet and brief. His health is rather delicate right now, and he really does need all the rest he can get.” Doctor Ujiko told him quietly, shepherding him gently to his master’s room. 
   “S-Sensei?” 
   A small Shigaraki hung in the doorway and clutched at the frame as if it would tether him to reality, barely able to comprehend what his young eyes were seeing. 
   That immovable pillar who had taught and steered him these past few years was nowhere to be found in those papery hospital sheets. Instead, there lied a faceless, armless doll, totally pathetic in its helplessness. It was one of the most horrific and pitiable things he’d ever seen, like an angel with its wings ripped off, and when it opened its mouth to speak with his master’s voice, hoarse and weak but still lifting somehow with a dark chuckle, he couldn’t stop the tears from falling. 
   “Oh, Tomura-kun… I’ve taken quite the knock here, haven’t I?” 
Shigaraki clapped a hand over his mouth, almost gagging as his mind conjured the image of Izuku in his old master’s place. No, no no… no, he wouldn’t let that happen. He could never let that happen.He’d scooped Izuku up just in time.Thoroughly disturbed by his findings, Tomura was about to close the window and shut down the laptop when he saw that he could access the files of an ‘Inko Midoriya’ from here, as well.Sensei’s… wife? Partner? Surrogate?  Fling? And Izuku’s mother. What would be on her file, he wondered?He decided to follow his curiosity to chase away the morbidity of his previous findings, but was somewhat disappointed. Aside from a minor fracture when she was 9, the birth of Izuku, and some surgery she had not long afterward, her file was totally normal. Except…Huh.Looks like Ujiko had been her doctor for a time as well, seemingly as the family physician. Had he been there to keep an eye on her while his master was away? But then, why hadn’t he known-?Suddenly, the base-wide intercom buzzed to life. “Dinner’s ready, everyone! Come and get it!”Whatever. It probably didn’t matter, not anymore. Shigaraki stood and hummed at the pleasant pop in his back as he stretched, then made his way down to the kitchen where he could smell something delicious cooking.He wondered if Izuku was a fan of curry.
        Notes:
          Two weeks from now, Shiggy and Izuku have another talk, this time over dinner. Though, perhaps things will go a little differently...?I say two weeks because I'm afraid I may be taking a break from posting next Wednesday's chapter, as I'll be busy with several things IRL (including my birthday, which is tomorrow/today! :D) and may not have time to get to posting it. I've really been looking forward to writing it, however, so it may go up after all. We shall see! c:Any updates on this will be made on my writing blog, here: https://windyskyes.tumblr.com/(I also post a silly spoiler without context meme for the next chapter every time a new one goes up, so there's that too lol)As always, kudos and comments are appreciated.

    Chapter Text
    Shigaraki arrived at the kitchen, grabbing two plates and loading them up without preamble.“You’re not going to be eating with us again?” Toga asked, sounding disappointed as she peered up at him with her hand propping up her chin. She took another bite of her curry as she watched him pile both plates high with generous servings of rice.“No, not for a little while I’m afraid,” Tomura explained, “I want Izuku to get used to eating with us, bit by bit, so he can acclimate to living here. If we were to all eat together in his cell right now he would become overwhelmed, and if we were to bring him out to eat with us here too soon he would try to run. Chasing him down or restraining him like a dog would make him distrust us more, and defeat the purpose. So,” He filched a hearty bite off one of the plates and continued, “until the others arrive and secure this place more thoroughly, I will be eating with him. Maybe once he’s settled in a bit, you can come share a meal with him, as well.”Toga gave him a small grin at that. “So you’re saying I can go see him soon? Ooh, exciting~” The bag of candy Mr. Compress had snuck in for her earlier crinkled as she fished out another treat, unwrapped it, and popped it in her mouth.Shigaraki returned her smile, grateful to see her finally returning to her usual peppy self. He then nearly dropped his plate when Dabi brushed past him in a rush to get to the curry. “Dabi, what-?” “Sorry, boss,” The pyromancer apologized as Tomura turned to face him, only to find he’d snatched up a plate and was piling it quickly with food, not yet looking back at him. Mr. Compress snuck some extra green sides onto the fire user’s plate as Dabi turned to him and asked, “Hey, can we take dinner in the projection room? I know you just said you’re gonna eat with the kid to build trust or whatever, but this is-““What, right now?”Dabi turned fully to face him, expression serious as he completely missed the candy bar Toga stealthily hid behind his rice, “Yes, right now. I did some digging on the Midoriya’s earlier school days just now, and… well,”“You’ll want to see this.”Shigaraki reflected on the many disturbing truths he’d learned as he walked to Izuku’s cell, freshly warmed plates in hand. It had been…  quite the rabbit hole to go down. He’d been deathly still as he saw the bullying and torment a much tinier Izuku had been made to endure, to the point where the others had almost seemed worried as he got up to leave.Tomura had insisted he was fine and waved them off. Truthfully, though…At the moment, he… wasn’t sure what he was feeling.There was a deep, helpless frustration at seeing a much tinier Izuku’s suffering and knowing it was far too late to do anything meaningful about it. There was disgust for the scum that put him through that, even more so for the adults who witnessed the bullying and cheerfully decided to do nothing to stop it. There was vindication and a strangely comforting sense of kinship at knowing Izuku went through something not at all dissimilar to what he did that fateful day Sensei had found him alone and ignored on the streets, though it did nothing to ease his confusion on the boy’s aggressive attitude towards Shigaraki and the concept of villainy.So much of his childhood misery stemmed from civilians who refused to intervene. Why would he still want to save those people instead of tearing them and everything that made them this way to the ground? Had the despicable brainwashing techniques All Might had employed really been so effective, for Izuku to be so loyal to such a cruel system? (Really, he knew the man was vain, but it seemed that poor Izuku had only been allowed to have toys of his kidnapper growing up!)But then, out of all his reactions, the one he understood least was the Voice.Strangely, that visceral urge squatting in the back of his head that had been so eager to steal away Izuku’s quirk for the past day or so had gone completely silent at seeing the boy as a small child, only to flare right back up again with a vengeance after All Might started making more frequent appearances in the middle school years. As he felt more and more like a stranger in his own head, Shigaraki wondered not for the first time if he should bump up his procedure with the doctor. He would rather wait until things had cooled down a bit and they had more allies at the base, but this was starting to become worrisome...His brow furrowed as he thought back on his actions the past few days. He really had been having so many strange thoughts and urges lately, now that he stopped to think about it. Perhaps, something had gone wrong when he’d been pulled from the tank early, after all.Finally, he shook his head and banished those dark thoughts from his mind; he was coming up on Izuku’s room, and he wanted to be in a good mood for their meal together. They had many important things to discuss now, after all.He balanced one plate on his other arm like a waiter and reached into his pocket to grab the keycard, blinking in surprise to find something plastic crinkling against his fingers. He pulled it out to find a candy bar, one from the bag of candy he’d had Mr. Compress buy for Toga.He smirked at the kind prank and placed it on Izuku’s plate instead; he deserved a little treat to celebrate his first real, homecooked meal under their care, after all. He then opened the door-Only to find the boy jumping up and down on his cot like a three-year-old.Shigaraki blinked and stared for a moment, before breaking out into soft peals of laughter. “If I knew you were that bored, Izuku, I would’ve come to visit you a little sooner.”Izuku’s face turned beet red as he whirled in midair to face him, landing hastily on the ground and trying to look innocent. Belatedly, Tomura realized why he’d been doing something so childish in the first place: he was trying to reach the tiny window high above them, likely as part of some kind of escape attempt.Part of Tomura wanted to be irritated, but instead he snorted and shook his head. Even if he’d managed to reach, there was no opening mechanism, the glass was three inches thick, and the gap wouldn’t have been big enough for him to get his head or shoulders through anyways. His dear little brother wouldn’t be running away from home that easily.“Anyways… here’s dinner, you little weirdo.” Izuku practically dove onto his plate, whether to have an escape from the embarrassing conversation taking place or because his captor was almost 3 hours later than planned with his meal thanks to the impromptu meeting, Tomura was unsure.The plate was scalding hot, and the young hero held in a quiet hiss as he took it and set it carefully on his lap as he stepped back to sit on the cot. He would still really rather not be sharing meals with this lunatic,  especially after getting caught red-handed exploring a potential escape route, but he desperately needed more information on his surroundings. If playing nice lowered Shigaraki’s guard enough to hopefully let something slip, then that’s just what he would do. “Thank you.”“Yeah, no problem.” Replied a rather pleased looking Shigaraki. So far, so good!For a few minutes they ate in silence, and just as Izuku was beginning to wonder whether the other was going to try and hold a conversation this time or not, the man spoke up, “So… we got access to your medical records.”Izuku nearly dropped his spoon in shock as he turned to stare at him, wide-eyed. Despite gaining access to such terribly private information so soon after his capture, his tone was cautious and guarded as opposed to proud or gloating. Deku gulped down his spoonful of regrettably delicious curry and choked out, “Uh, you did?”“Yeah…” Shigaraki continued, a slight furrow in his brow as he refused to meet Izuku’s eyes, “Your bones are- that was- I’m, uh, sorry. About that.”Deku felt the hand clutching his cutlery tighten at the mention of the colossal damage to his arm, and remembered all that had happened to get it to that point. Muscular had said Shigaraki put him on a kill list...He forced himself to take a calming breath through his nose and a neutral tone as he replied, “... It’s fine, all in the past now. Besides, I’d rather you apologize to all the others you’ve hurt than to me.” Like his classmates. Or the people of Hosu.  Jaku. The teen jabbed his spoon into his meal harder than necessary and stuffed more curry into his face before he could keep talking and say something he’d regret.Shigaraki sighed unhappily, and replied, “Right, well… what’s done is done, I suppose. It wasn’t all bad though, your medical records I mean. Did you know, ‘zuku? We both have an extra toe joint. In the same places, too!” The villain chuckled to himself at the strange coincidence, then jumped and blinked as the sound of a spoon clattering deafeningly against the concrete floor filled the cell. He turned to his young prisoner to find his eyes wide and his jaw hanging open with half-chewed food, and he rolled his eyes at what must be a childish overreaction. “Yes, very funny. We can, in fact, have things in common. It’s not as crazy as you might think.”Shigaraki turned away from him and returned his wayward silverware with a flick of a tentacled wrist, and continued, “Especially with what we found, with Dabi’s-” Izuku immediately cut him off. “Wait. What toe joint?”Tomura finished chewing and swallowing his bite of food as he looked to the ceiling thoughtfully, remarking, “Oh yeah, the file said you were pretty little when they found that, so you probably don’t remember. You have an extra toe joint that most other people don’t have, and so do I. ‘s not a big deal, doesn’t really mean anything medically speaking as far as I know. Like having a mole. Or freckles.” He tapped the boy’s dotted cheek playfully at that last statement. That seemed to jolt him out of whatever trance he had been under, as the boy finally closed his jaw to swallow and robotically brought another spoonful to his mouth.Shigaraki dug into his bowl with more fervor and remarked, “Man, Compress did a real good job on this curry, huh,” Deku nodded numbly in agreement, not really hearing him.Shigaraki had been quirkless. Just like him. He had to have been born quirkless, but yet then how did he have-? Why would All For One…? And better yet, why did he not seem to know?…Unless.“...How did you meet him? Your uh, sensei, I mean.” Izuku muttered into his next bite. The honorific for the man who almost single-handedly ended All Might’s career stuck uncomfortably in his mouth like a wad of rotting meat, but he had a nasty, creeping suspicion about what was going on here, and he needed to be sure. Shigaraki blinked at the unexpected question, then answered with a faraway look in his eye, “...He saved me.”An uncomfortable lump settled in Izuku’s stomach that had nothing to do with his meal. The villain was quiet for a few moments after that, and the boy almost thought he’d dropped the subject and was about to try again when he continued, “...My quirk came in late, and very unexpectedly. It’s hard to remember what happened exactly, but…Well,” Shigaraki shrugged half-heartedly. Izuku’s throat went dry at the absolutely horrific implications, and the lump twisted itself into a painful knot. “I was on my own by the end of it.”“Oh, god… I’m so sorry, I had no idea that that was-! Y-you don’t have to-"“No, it’s alright,” Shigaraki cut him off quietly, “I’m fine with it now. They weren’t all good people, and I just… did what I had to do to get away from them.” Somehow, Izuku didn’t believe him.Underneath his impression of the villain’s harsh and insane veneer, Izuku couldn’t help but see a glimmer of what little Eri had been when he first found her. A child, scared and alone and hating herself for being unable to control her destructive powers. Deku felt as if someone was driving the sharp end of an ice pick up into his chest. All this time…. all this time, Shigaraki has been just like her, just a manipulated and abused child in need of rescue, but… no one had come for him.No one but the monster who had been the one to put him in that position in the first place, who scooped him up to twist him into what he was today.A means to hurt All Might. A weapon. A  tool.A spidery hand landed gently on his shoulder as somewhere far away, Shigaraki continued speaking. “It’s why I’m so grateful to have you here, Izuku. You’re my second chance!”Yes… yes, for once he found himself agreeing fully and completely with Shigaraki. The man had started out as a child who was a victim of horrific circumstances, but then grown into something horrific himself. That child may be long gone by now, and he might be a fool for wanting to save him, but...What kind of hero would he be, if he didn’t make every effort he could to try and reach someone who was in need?Izuku stared into Shigaraki’s eyes with a newfound determination for a few long, searching moments, and whispered, “You didn’t kill them on purpose, did you?”The man flinched and removed his hand from Izuku’s back as though it had burned him, but the boy pressed on insistently, “You would have been so young, there’s just no way you could have knowingly done such a thing… I don’t know what All For One told you growing up, but the people of the world aren’t all monsters. Not inherently!” He motioned to all the items around his cell that had been placed there for his comfort, to the candy bar he had been given freely with no strings attached, to the bunny plush that still sat watchfully at the foot of the cot. “I don’t know what exactly drove you to think you need to destroy society completely, and I am so sorry that the hero system failed you for so long, but there are better ways to change things. There’s still so much good in the world! You still have good in you, too, and I know that you can reach it if you try. Everyone can.”A terrible snarl twisted the man’s face. “Really?  Everyone? Even the twerps who bullied you, who broke your ankle when you were five? Even the adults who sat by and did nothing as Bakugou blasted you, tore you down,  suicide baited  you?” Shigaraki snapped, vindictive, standing to tower over him, “We’re the same, Izuku. We were nothing until our masters found us and built us up to greatness!”Now it was Izuku’s turn to flinch, shocked at the knowledge that Shigaraki knew so much about his childhood, but still the man plowed mercilessly on, “Only, yours deceived you, Izuku! He snatched you away from your real family, raised you to be something you’re not! All Might twisted you into a prop for his deluded illusion of peace, and a weapon to be pointed at my master!”Deku straightened his back and matched the other's tone, not intimidated in the slightest, “Have you ever considered that you have it backwards? That All For One gave you that quirk, and then… Do you even know what having an extra toe joint means? It indicates quirklessness, Shigaraki!  He gave you that quirk, then swooped in to pick up the pieces when everyone who cared for you was gone!”Shigaraki turned abruptly to face him fully, outrage evident in his tone as he roared, “He would never! Why would he even do that to some random kid? Sensei saved me while everyone else pretended I wasn’t there, blinded by the illusion that everything would be alright! You already know how that feels, Izuku. You know exactly what I mean. Remember the mall? I would have been caught there if everyone wasn’t living in the false utopia that All Might planted in their heads, and the summer camp assault, All Might’s downfall,  Jaku all never would have happened. Instead, they just waltzed on by while you sat helpless and terrified in my grasp.”“So, All For One has never done anything controlling to you? Never forced you to do something horrible or cruel against your will? Was your upbringing with him  really a good one, or were you just trained to obey his every command and worship the ground at his feet?”Shigaraki was taken aback, and seemed to consider his response carefully. He finally huffed out a deep breath and growled,  “There’s no point in talking about this with you. You’re too stubborn, and you don’t even know what you’re talking about. Not in the slightest. Let’s just drop it, okay?”Izuku bit back the argument at the tip of his tongue and complied; this fight wasn’t getting them anywhere. The white-haired villain slunk down onto the mattress further away from Izuku than before and sulkily resumed eating without another word. The pair mulled their words over and picked at their food in the sullen silence that followed, neither looking at the other. As Shigaraki finished his meal and stared into his empty plate for a few moments more, he quietly muttered, “... I’m sorry.”Izuku almost dropped his spoon again in surprise. “What?”“I never meant to come in here to harass you or fight over things that are in the past, I just- I want you to understand me, and why I’m doing what I’m doing. I don’t want you to resent me for keeping you here.”Izuku thought on this for a moment, considering ignoring his captor’s lukewarm apology and finishing his last few bites in silence. The memory of Eri receding willingly into the darkness with the man who brought her so much pain stung the back of his eyelids guiltily.Despite himself, Deku swallowed his stinging pride and answered, “...I’m sorry, too. You’re right about one thing: I don’t know enough about your childhood to judge you for back then, even if I absolutely do for all the terrible things you’ve done since USJ,” He turned to face Shigaraki, “But, I...I want to understand you better, too.”Shigaraki blinked slowly at him in disbelief, and Izuku almost worried that he’d overdone it and come off as suspicious until a slow smile spread across the other’s face. It was nothing like the sadistic leer he’d seen at the mall, or the unhinged mania that had been on his face during the USJ attack. It was warm and gentle. Genuine.His heart ached with something like pity for a moment; how many of these kind smiles had been traded to create the monster in front of him? What kind of person would Shigaraki have been, had All For One not gotten his hands on him and twisted him into a killer?“Hey, I think that’s the nicest thing you’ve said to me so far. That reminds me, I actually have a present for you…”So saying, the man turned and rummaged through his cloak pocket, and the boy was about to start worrying about what else the man could possibly want to add to his room until he produced-Izuku gasped aloud, and couldn’t bring himself to care enough to be embarrassed. “Is that-?”“A journal and pen? Yes, it is. I know it was a hobby of yours, and believe it or not, I really do want you to be comfortable here with us. It’s all yours.” It was a simple little thing, small enough to fit in a pocket and sporting a tiny pen attached by a chain, but it was more than anything Izuku had dared hope for.He could cry with joy and relief. This kind of luck was unbelievable! It would be such a huge help in getting him out of here; he could write down and organize his thoughts! He could plan out routes! He could-“Of course,” Shigaraki continued cheerily, wrecking his train of thought, “I’m going to have to be a nosy older brother here and take a peek every now and then to make sure you’re not planning something sneaky. Like, say, an escape attempt out the window?”Deku’s heart sank. Of course, it wouldn’t be that easy. Shigaraki wasn’t an idiot, after all; if anything, he would use this “gift” to the League’s advantage; anything he wrote down would likely be used to improve their security or set traps.His cheeks flushed with embarrassment at the mention of his previous attempt to scout what was outside his cell through the window, and the villain ruffled his hair and chuckled at his face.To Izuku’s enormous offense, he then wiped his hand on his pants with a grimace as if it’d been covered in grease. It had only been a day, his hair wasn’t that oily! “Now that we’re done eating, I think you’re due for a shower. C’mon, let’s go.”Izuku perked up at the mention of being allowed out of his cell and eagerly helped Shigaraki gather up their dishes. “Ah, are you gonna eat that?” The man was eyeing his untouched candy bar hungrily.Izuku was tempted to unwrap it and wolf it down in one bite as retribution for the older’s teasing, but reconsidered. Instead, he broke it in half and offered up the slightly smaller half to the villain. “Wanna split?”“Sure,” Shigaraki said, flicking his nose playfully and grinning at the way the boy’s face involuntary screwed up, “But next time, I call dibs on the bigger piece.”The trip to and from the showers was uneventful. Shigaraki waited outside while Izuku scrubbed himself down with soap and shampoo that smelled strange compared to his usual brand, and though he scanned thoroughly, there seemed to be no windows or alternative exits of any kind in the shower room. Damn.As he scrubbed, he couldn’t help but ponder what he and Shigaraki had spoken on earlier. It felt… very strange, not to mention uncomfortable, to try and be friendly with the murderer who’d terrorized him since the very beginning of his journey, but yet… could he be redeemed all the same? After every terrible thing he’d done, after the path in life he’d chosen for himself, was there anything that could bring him out of All For One’s machinations and back into the light? Or, would Izuku be wasting his time trying to save a villainous lunatic instead of focusing his energies on getting out of here in one piece? Would it be better to escape and try to involve an expert, or was this bond Shigaraki wanted to grow with him going to be the best chance he got?He sighed as he cast his jumbled thoughts and feelings aside and finished up, changing into the nondescript clothes his captor had handed him before he’d gotten in.Deku exited the bathroom to find Shigaraki dozing propped up against the wall as he waited for him. The desperate urge to slink away before he was noticed flashed through his mind, but he pushed it back to instead put on a friendly smile as he called out, “I’m done!”The man who’d taken down the top heroes of the country the other day jolted awake with a snort as he narrowly caught himself from slipping down the wall and falling on his ass. The man blinked and looked around groggily, before yawning, “Oh, yeah you are. Come on, let’s get you back to your room.” Izuku frowned slightly as he realized he probably really could have made a good escape attempt just now if he hadn’t woken his captor, and tried not to let that fact burn in his gut.  It’s way too soon to attempt anything,  he reasoned,  I would’ve just been caught and put under tighter security. The base was silent as they made the trek back to Izuku’s cell, and as they passed a row of windows Izuku stared longingly out at the moon that hung high above. It was a waning crescent, and barely cast enough light to illuminate the walls of whatever compound they were in, much less whatever scenery lay just outside. Shigaraki casually threw an arm over his shoulder, whether because he’d noticed his staring or just to be companionable, Izuku didn’t know.Maybe it was both.Finally, they arrived back at the hall that held his little cell, and Shigaraki seemed to wake up a bit as Izuku tensed at the old man waiting for them down the hall.“Ah! Hello Tomura-kun, little Izuku. Do you remember me?” He greeted them jovially, an impatient bounce to his stride as he came closer.Of course he remembered him. He would never forget the face of the very first person who crushed his dream.But, why…. why on earth was his childhood doctor here?! Was he being held as a hostage, to incentivize Izuku into joining somehow? No, if he was free and on familiar terms with Shigaraki then…. was he working with the villains?!Izuku felt as if someone had upended a jar of every bug in the world into his stomach. The hand on his shoulder tightened somewhat, and Shigaraki pinched the bridge of his nose as he let out a weary sigh. “Doctor, it’s late… What is this about?”The old man stooped to pick up a medical bag that had been sitting not far away, and Izuku shuddered and unconsciously leaned back into Shigaraki’s hold as he came closer, his senses suddenly on high alert. “Oh, it has nothing to do with what I spoke on with you before, I assure you! I simply want to give the boy a basic physical before I get too taken up with my other obligations, just to get  acquainted with him in case something were to happen-” Shigaraki didn’t stop walking to let the doctor greet Izuku as he seemed to want to, and instead nudged past him to stand in front of the boy’s door. “There’s no need, doctor. He didn’t sustain any significant injuries at Jaku, and according to his records, had a physical not long before arriving here. Why don’t you focus on getting the lab set up to receive the Nearly High Ends, if you’re feeling restless? There should be some arriving by tomorrow.”“Th-the  what  ?” Izuku stuttered, suddenly feeling overwhelmed. Nearly high end of what? Did the villains have some sort of special task force? But then, what would this doctor, his childhood doctor, have to do with-?“Don’t you worry about it, zucchini. Goodnight, don’t forget to brush your teeth!”“I told you, don’t call me that! Wait, hold on-!” Too late, he’d already been shoved back into his unwilling residence. The lock clicked shut behind him as he pressed his palms to the door, and Izuku groaned as he slunk back over to his new journal waiting for him on his cot. Well. He may as well map out what he could remember of the route to the showers, and figure out a code to record everything he’d learned so far. Perhaps, something that could be disguised as doodles? Despite Shigaraki’s earlier warnings, he wasn’t giving up on his new journal THAT easily.Then, his eyes wandered over to the pile of reading material he’d been provided. Perhaps...Meanwhile, on the other side of the door, Shigaraki eyed the old man with mild suspicion. “Was a checkup really all you came here for, Ujiko?”“Yes, of course! Look in my bag, if you don't believe me,” The madman insisted, and exposed the contents of his bag for the other to see: a stethoscope, a tool for measuring blood pressure, a light for checking eyes and ears… nothing out of the ordinary or suspicious. Tomura smiled.“Alright, I believe you. I appreciate you looking out for Izuku, but it’s really not necessary. I would rather you focus on finishing the noumu for now, yeah?”The doctor nodded, not a trace of frustration on his face despite the sweat beading his brow and the slight tremor to his hands. “Of course, that I shall do. Goodnight, Tomura-kun!”The All For One user was already halfway down the hall. “Goodnight, doctor.”A few moments of silence passed after he turned the corner. Doctor Ujiko stood alone in front of the child’s cell door, unable to open it. Shigaraki wouldn’t be giving others access to the boy until he was sure he’d settled in, and by that time Ujiko would be swamped.Unseen to both hero and villain, the doctor threw down his bag and kicked the wall in frustration. “Drat!”
        Notes:
          My, what sweet bonding moments Shiggy and Izu had this chapter! Just a shame the poor doctor didn't get his foot in the door sooner. :)Next chapter, someone visits Izuku's cell! Someone who isn't Shigaraki, for once...? :0Comments and kudos are appreciated. As always, thank you for reading! &lt;3

    Chapter Text
    Over the next few days, Izuku found himself settling into a bizarrely comfortable, if claustrophobic, routine. He would wake up, brush his teeth, do as much exercise and training as he could in such a limited space, then share breakfast with Shigaraki. After his morning visit, he would bury himself in his books and journal until lunch came along, at which point his captor would insist they play some variation of handheld games for around an hour before leaving him to his own devices again. After dinner, he would be escorted to and from the shower before being offered another round of gaming, though not before his self-declared ‘older brother’ took a good long look at his journal. All in all, it… wasn’t  awful . Especially considering he was technically a prisoner of one of the most feared villain organizations in the country. It was almost like being stuck on a vacation where he couldn’t leave his room. And where the room service insisted on bonding with him. His room… how long had it been, before his kidnapping, since he’d last left the dorms to have a proper visit with his mom? Two months? Three? He wondered if she had left it the same, or if she’d changed anything around since then. How well was his mother handling his capture? Was she still eating enough, or was she worrying herself sick over him? No no, he was certain the others wouldn’t let that happen; he knew All Might and Aizawa-sensei must have come in to at least check on her after breaking the news to her, and knowing his classmates she probably got gifts and visits from them, as well- Izuku frowned and squashed the welling bubble of homesickness ballooning in his chest and forced himself to focus on what he was writing. Currently, he was trying to puzzle out as much as he could of his prison from the very,  very limited information he had. Despite this, he’d somehow made decent progress. The other day, he’d managed to heckle Shigaraki into letting him have an early shower while it was still daylight out, and finally managed to see what was outside the hall windows on his trip to the showers. Disappointingly, he only saw an overgrown lawn, a yellowing wall that likely surrounded the perimeter of the building, and the tops of the trees beyond. Though he hadn’t seen much, he had noticed the lack of one important thing: there were no skyscrapers within sight. That meant they probably weren’t in the city, or were somewhere along the outskirts. Not much to go off of, but it was a start. There were other things he’d learned from little details as well; as far as he could tell, he didn’t have an armed guard sitting outside his door. The facility he was being held in was most likely some kind of aging military compound that could potentially function off the grid, based on certain descriptions from a molding history book that matched what little he’d seen of the building. His most promising discovery of all, however, had to do with the device on his wrist. He’d found that it  could , in fact, be tampered with without setting off any noticeable alarms. If he was clever with his resources, he was pretty sure he might even be able to jerryrig a device that blocked its effects on him entirely! Deku hadn’t dared to try assembling something like that just yet, however; if found, it would be a death sentence for any budding goodwill he’d built up between himself and Shigaraki. For now, the rough design was tucked away in the most boring section of the most boring book he’d been given, safe from nefarious eyes. Shigaraki never said he couldn’t deface any of his  other reading materials, after all! Still, to avoid any outright suspicion Izuku had gone ahead and indulged himself in pouring all his analysis and theories on the villains’ quirks into the journal he’d been given. It was deeply cathartic after all he’d been through, to say the least, and the look of amazement and fond reminiscing on Shigaraki’s face when he’d first read through it had been as mysterious and unsettling as it was strangely flattering. He really must be going stir crazy, if he was starting to actually  care about what his kidnapper thought of him. The boy peeked up from his literature to take a look at the clock. Almost lunchtime. Lately, Shigaraki had been mentioning small goings on around the base during their small talk. One nugget he had been particularly excited to share was the discovery of a training room. (Just how big  was this place, for them to be discovering new rooms almost a week after arriving…?) He’d said something to the effect of considering letting him out of this room and even out of the quirk suppression cuff for a while so they could train their multiple quirks together once Izuku had proven himself “trustworthy enough”. How Shigaraki expected him to do that while locked away all day and night, however, Izuku had no idea. Surely, he didn’t think keeping him in here forever would eventually change his mind? Or… was he just trying to find something that he thought would bring him over to the dark side? Shigaraki had mentioned that he thought Izuku was related to someone important on his first day in here, and that he would tell him who it was when he found “proof”. Was he spending all this time under lock and key because his captor was trying to find evidence that Izuku was who he thought he was? What would happen to him if nothing ever came up? Would he just be left to rot here forever like some forgotten plaything, or… would Shigaraki change his tactics to something less friendly? Would the other villains even approve of keeping him alive, by that point? It was of very little comfort to him that every day, more and more criminals seemed to arrive at the base. Just this morning, he’d awoken to his teeth rattling at what he’d thought had been an earthquake, only for his white-haired breakfast partner to assure him it was just someone called Gigantomachia arriving at base and walking past his room. He had a pretty solid guess as to which member THAT was... The longer he stayed here, the more secure the base became, and the slimmer his chances of escaping. He was running out of time. Now more than ever, Izuku couldn’t help but kick himself for not running when he’d had a chance at the showers; he could formulate a better plan now with all this new information, yes, but from how Shigaraki had spoken with such confidence and relief when mentioning the new arrivals, it sounded like they’d been running on a skeleton crew up until now. Add to that how exhausted everyone must have been with some still recovering from Jaku… He’d really blown a perfect chance to run… But then, if he’d run he would never have learned about Shigaraki’s motivations and origins, about how terrifyingly similar they were in some ways, about how he still may have a glimmer of hope for redemption. If he had even a chance to rescue Shigaraki from himself, then he had to try. All the same, Izuku had no idea how much time he had before things turned ugly for him. He had to either come up with an escape plan or find a way to turn his captor’s worldview around, fast. If he could only convince Shigaraki to let him out of this quirk suppression brace and train for a bit… maybe a good clean sparring session without any form of escape attempt would be a good enough show of good faith to win his trust? A few minutes earlier than usual, the telltale rattle of his door being unlocked filled the cell. Izuku marked his place and set the book aside as he yawned and stretched in his seat, scooting to face the door. Already, he was formulating the best way to butter up his white-haired captor for what he wanted to request. Perhaps he’d let him win the first few rounds then compliment him on his skill, or pretend to have more fun than usual, or- Only, it wasn’t Shigaraki who walked through the door.
Instead, two other members of the League walked into his cell, one he recognized as the girl with the transformation quirk who had tried to stab him during Eri’s rescue mission (Toga, his mind provided) and another who was burned into his memory as the fire user who’d dragged Kacchan through the warp gate at summer camp. His piercing neon blue eyes bore into him with keen interest as the teen girl beside him bounced from foot to foot excitedly. “Hiya, Izukuuu~!”“Hey, kid. Hope you don’t mind if we take the boss’s place for providing your little lunch break this time around.” 
 Shigaraki took a long swig from his coffee mug as he finally,  finally sat down to do some research on Izuku’s parentage. He hadn’t meant to take so long getting to it; he’d had so much to do between organizing his steady influx of troops and getting the base set up, and when he did find the rare moment to breathe he found himself distracted by the veritable treasure trove of information Dabi had dug up earlier. Last night had been particularly difficult. Gigantomachia had learned the hard way that he was allergic to the polyester bedding they’d provided for him, the hydroelectric dam had gotten clogged by a log and caused a power outage for part of the night, a family of raccoons had been discovered to be living in the wall space in Dabi’s room… All in all, it had been chaos. Just one damn thing after another. It was to be expected, he supposed; nobody said that being a Grand Commander would be easy. Still, though he’d felt a little better after his morning chat with Izuku, Toga had begged him for what felt like the thousandth time to be allowed a visit to the boy’s cell and he just hadn’t had the energy to tell her no anymore. It was probably about time he started letting in visitors anyways, and with Dabi there to hopefully reign her in a bit it would probably be fine. No more dwelling on that, however. He was going to find out who this kid’s parents were today once and for all, or he was going to pass out in his seat trying. 
 His new visitors caught Izuku more than a little off guard; he didn’t want to say he panicked and scrambled to his feet, knocking down his once neatly-stacked book piles in the process at the sight of them, but, well… “Here’s lunch! Delicious and hearty beef stew!” Toga announced with delight as she bounced over to him, her bowl sloshing ominously. The other villain approached at a more sedated pace after relocking the door behind them and took a seat on the floor among the ruins of the book piles, unconcerned with the mess Izuku had just made. “Toga, stop that. You’re gonna spill, and I’m not heating it up for you again if you let it get cold,” He scolded lightly, sounding bored. She skipped around for a few moments more like an excited puppy, grabbing two of the spare pillows off Izuku’s bed as well as the bunny plush. She used one cushion as a seat and the other as a tray, with the bunny resting in the crook of her arm as if to partake in her meal. Its beady eyes stared out blankly in front of it with what Izuku was sure could be mortification. The girl then patted the spot between herself and the other villain invitingly, looking up at Izuku with an expectant grin. He hovered for a moment, feeling uncomfortable and frankly rather put upon, before lowering himself cautiously across from them, completing the triangle. “Here.” The man handed Izuku one of the bowls of soup, and he blew it gently as he took it. “Thank you, uh…?” “Dabi.” Izuku nodded politely and tried very hard not to think about the last few times he’d last seen this ‘Dabi’s’ face. “So!” Toga grinned, “Are you enjoying your stay, so far? You don’t miss those other guys too much, do you~?” “Heh, are you single is what she’s really asking-hey!” Izuku winced in sympathy as Toga kicked the shin adjacent to hers, her reddening cheeks puffed up with indignation as she tried to hide behind her bowl as she hissed, “Dabi!! You promised you wouldn't tease!” “How was I supposed to resist, when you made it so easy?” Izuku snorted quietly into his stew at their tomfoolery, disturbed though he was at the girl’s weird fixation on him. Maybe this wouldn’t be so bad, after all, if they were going to play nice then so would he. In a way, this might prove to be the chance he’d been hoping for. “As I was  saying…”  Toga huffed still sounding scandalized, “I know Shigaraki brings the videogames in here sometimes on his breaks with you. Have  you managed to beat him at the racing game?”  “No,” Izuku answered with a scowl. He had come so close last time, too, until the man had gleefully revealed he’d been sitting on a blue shell and waiting until Izuku was just within sight of the finish line to deploy it. Sadistic bastard, truly a villain through and through... “He do the stupid blue shell trick on you too?” Dabi asked, looking amused and annoyed in equal parts. A fellow victim. “Ugh, that’s a regular thing for him? No wonder he’s All For One’s chosen successor.” Or perhaps,  because  he was unfortunate enough to be the menace’s chosen successor... “Well, then you should keep your strength up, kid.” Izuku blinked at the dark-haired man in confusion, and he clarified, “To deal with Shigaraki at dinner, I mean. Last night was hell and today hasn’t been much better, so he’ll probably be grouchy as shit if he comes to visit you.” Oh. That would explain why he’d almost fallen asleep sitting up this morning, as well as why he hadn’t shown up now... “Noted. So uh, what do you do here?” Izuku asked, trying his best to be inconspicuous as he segwayed into more useful territory. Dabi shrugged modestly, and answered, “Just odd jobs here and there around the base right now, as well as researching you when I have the time.” “Researching m-me?” “Yeah,” Dabi muttered around a mouthful of beef and carrot, “You have some… striking similarities to someone interesting here, and I’ll admit, I got a little curious while I was stuck on bed rest the first day or so after the battle.” Oh, god. If someone else here aside from Shigaraki was seeing similarities between him and this mystery relative, then there may be a grain of truth to it after all. Was there some villain on his mom’s side, from the family that gave her up maybe? Did he really actually have an evil uncle running around somewhere who’d teamed up with the League? He wasn’t sure what he’d do if he did. Suffice to say, he was feeling more nervous about it now than ever. “Ooh, what’s this?” Toga cooed suddenly, bringing him out of his worry-ridden thoughts. “What-hey, put that down!” The girl was flipping through his journal, beaming at the contents within and holding it up at different angles as if it were a fashion magazine. Izuku made to swipe it away from her, but she just giggled and scooted back as she passed it to Dabi. Deku remembered the blue flames the man had effortlessly sprouted what felt like a lifetime ago in the woods, and his heart started pounding as those dangerous, scorched hands cradled his only escape from this hellhole, in both senses of the word. “P-please be careful with that!” “Wow, begging already? Guess we know how to twist your arm, now, eh?” The man chuckled meanly, leaning closer to the girl to get a better look at the journal they were holding. Izuku gulped uncomfortably as he tightened his grip on his spoon. He was pretty sure they were just playing, but it still felt far too soon for that kind of familiarity... “Wow, these are some nice drawings! You did all these yourself, right?” Toga gushed. She then started flapping one of her hands and squealed, “Ooh, look! This one’s of me!!” “Yeah, there’s some good shit in here.” Dabi remarked, “Strengths, weaknesses, various applications and combinations with others, all organized and shit… you whipped all this up in just a few days?” The villain looked only mildly impressed, but his tone betrayed how fascinated he really was with the work Izuku had done. Izuku blushed despite himself at the praise, and glanced away bashfully. “Y-yeah, I’ve been doing it since I was a kid… it’s just an old hobby.” A pair of small, manicured hands cupped his cheeks, and Toga was suddenly entirely too close for comfort. “Your cheeks look so cute when they’re full of blood, Izu-kun~! Let me have just a little taste…” She bared her teeth in a wide grin, and leaned in even closer. Izuku yelped and scrambled backwards as he kicked her away, nearly spilling his stew in the process. Dabi clicked his tongue disapprovingly and grabbed the teen by her scruff before she could give pursuit, rolling his eyes. “Toga, c’mon. You promised you wouldn’t try to bite him.” “And  you promised you wouldn’t tease!” Izuku rested a hand over his chest to contain his rabbiting heartbeat as the fire user apologized and finally returned his journal. “Hey, sorry about that. She bites to show affection, sometimes.” Izuku blinked at him, bewildered as he cautiously scooted back into the circle a good distance away from the obsessive girl and clutched his journal safely to his chest. “I’ll, uh, make a note of that then.” Toga stopped struggling against Dabi and smiled at him, seemingly pleased with the notion of having more written about her. “Hehe, maybe I can model for you too, if you decide to add another picture! I have some nicer outfits I can wear...” The girl batted her shining eyes at him, and Izuku leaned subtly away and avoided returning the eye contact. “N-no, that’s ok.” At this point, he honestly couldn’t tell if she had a crush on him or if this was all just some bizarre intimidation tactic... “Anyways, I can see why Shigaraki wants you in with us,” Dabi continued, “your skills would be really useful to the team. Could’ve probably prevented what happened with Hawkes, at the very least.” The mood in the room plummeted instantly. Toga seemed to deflate like an untied balloon, and Dabi stared wistfully at the ground, brow furrowed as he lost himself in a memory.  Deku blinked in surprise and felt a nasty welt of unease swelling in his stomach. “Wait…  Hawkes ? Number 2 pro-hero Hawkes? What do you mean, what happened? Did he capture-?” “He killed one of us.” Izuku’s ears were suddenly ringing in the silence that followed as he tried to make sense of the words that had entered them. That couldn’t be possible… Hawkes was the number 2 right behind Endeavor! He had seemed so cool and competent when Tokoyami had talked about him, there was no way someone so far up the charts would do something so awful. Maybe he had been backed into a corner, or it was an accident, or- Deku’s shock and disbelief must have shown on his face or he must have mumbled something aloud, because Dabi quietly said, “He did. In cold blood, too.” “N-no, he wouldn’t- A real pro-hero would never  intentionally- ” This was some kind of trick, a manipulation tactic to get him on their side. But… he could see from the hurt and anger shining in Toga’s eyes that she was truly grieving the loss of a friend. Dabi’s bore into his own, serious and unwavering “That’s why you should come work with us, kid. Cause like, at least we’re honest about our intentions, unlike those sleazy Commission bastards and hero society as a whole.” Izuku couldn’t help but scoff at the suggestion. There was absolutely nothing honest about villainy.  “I don’t believe you. If he really had committed a murder, the law wouldn’t have protected him just because he’s a hero. He would’ve had his license revoked and been removed from the chart! Why would he just throw away his whole career like that?” Dabi gave him a dark grin and replied, “I’ve been wondering the same thing myself, actually. Would you believe he was trying to jump ship and join us? My mistake in giving him a chance and letting him get so close…” Hawkes had… tried to  join the villains?! If Izuku hadn’t been kidnapped by Shigaraki and declared to be a long lost relative of some friend to the League, he would’ve said it was the craziest thing he’d heard all week. That-that couldn’t be all there was to it. “There must be some mistake… he wouldn’t want to join you guys, and even if he did - ” “Well, he did.” The man cut in. “And now, because of him, Twice is-” He stopped short at the loud sniffle the girl next to him emitted. Toga’s lip wobbled precariously, and Dabi put a comforting hand on her shoulder and gave him a look that said it was time to change the subject. Deku didn’t miss the hurt and resentment in the other teen’s eyes as she glared a hole into the floor, irrational though her anger with him was for someone she barely knew and had a history of attempted stabbings with. He sighed, and decided to go ahead and drop it. For now, at least. “...How did you guys get so much information on me so fast? Shigaraki somehow got into my medical records on the first day I got here. Was grabbing me all part of the plan?” He asked as casually as he could, intent to keep digging for whatever he could. Dabi gave him a mildly annoyed look for cornering him like that, but obliged, “I don’t know anything about the medical records, but I do know that the intel we dug up on your childhood was all me.” He muttered into a spoonful of broth.  “You were so cute as a little kid.” Toga interjected with a smile, still a little wobbly but steadily regaining her composure, “That Kacchan kid was so mean to you, though. Why did you want to get him back so bad at Kamino, if he was always such a bully?” So, they really did know about all his childhood business now. Feeling the violation of privacy and humiliation burn in his chest, Deku grit out, “Because it’s what heroes do. We save people.” Dabi snorted derisively into his soup as he shot back, “Yeah, right. Still, I think you would’ve been a way better fit for us than that brat, if we’d grabbed you up sooner. Don’t think we could’ve picked a more fitting representation of shitty fake heroes today if we’d tried.” The fire user shook his head, clearly lamenting their choice of kidnappee in the past. “Heh, at the very least, you would’ve taken a hell of a lot less blastings.” Izuku said nothing as he scraped some of the final dregs of soup out of the bottom of the bowl and into his mouth, a bitter taste that had nothing to do with his food lingering in his mouth. If All Might hadn’t found him… Had it been someone like All For One who had come along with the promise of a quirk and a future instead, when he was small and impressionable… Would he have ended up like Shigaraki? The boy shook his head and pressed on, determined to get back on track and mine more information out of the other while he could, “Still, that doesn’t explain how you sorted out all that information so fast. You would’ve had to hack almost fifteen years worth of security footage from the area I grew up in, and then fished out the clips that had me in them. That would’ve taken months, maybe weeks if you were lucky. How on earth did you-?” “Who said I hacked in?” Dabi replied smugly behind a mouthful of soup. “I have a… well, let’s just say an  old friend on the police force who was gracious enough to lend me access to the files. As for how we sorted it all out… it’s incredible what facial recognition programs can do these days. Whole thing took me like, nine hours tops.” Izuku’s stomach dropped like a lead ball in the ocean. The villains had a contact in the police? This was bad. This could be very, very bad. How far did their influence go? Was it just one contact in local police, or… did it run up to a higher ranking officer, someone important? Somewhere like Tartarus, even? Izuku chewed his bottom lip nervously as all the possibilities ran through his head then blinked at the look he was being given. Dabi stared at him as if he’d just done something incriminating, cold blue eyes calculating as if trying to solve a puzzle. His eyes… something about his eyes was suddenly incredibly, achingly familiar. Somehow, they looked so much like Todoroki’s... he selfishly wished that his friends and teachers could be here with him, to help him make sense of all this madness. Izuku was hit hard with a wave of homesickness all of a sudden, and quickly looked back down to his empty soup bowl before the other could notice. “Wow, that’s so cool Dabi! I didn’t know you had a friend in the police.” Toga exclaimed as she brought her bowl down from her lips where she’d just chugged the last of her stew. “And speaking of  friendship… do you wanna play any games while we’re here, Izuku? We brought cards~!” She declared cheerfully, scooting dangerously close to entering his personal space again and giving him her best puppy eyes. Izuku sighed and decided he may as well. These two were crazy, but they were the first human contact he’d had outside of Shigaraki for almost a week now, and he would take what he could get. Speaking of their illustrious leader, this was the first time the man had been absent from one of Izuku’s meals. Where  was Shigaraki, anyways? 
 Shigaraki leaned back in his chair, staring in slack-jawed disbelief at his computer screen. Unbelievable. Somehow, the files on Mr. Midoriya were all... so completely and utterly  mundane . No criminal record, no serious monetary issues or signs of laundering… Not even a charge of littering. Regular background, regular parents, regular schooling and career… Even the face was wrong! No matter how hard he looked, the man appeared for all the world to be a regular salaryman, working hard overseas in America to provide for his lovely wife and child waiting for him in Japan. Well, that didn’t mean anything. Not really. Of course Sensei would fabricate the perfect cover to protect his precious wife and child from his enemies, one that would allow him to be away from them for long stretches of time without drawing suspicion from nosy neighbors. Keeping a low profile would make sense as well, just to be sure no cops came poking around. Uh, and maybe he’d used a quirk to change his appearance? Or had his photos digitally altered in all his official documents? Still… Why had Sensei not said anything about his family earlier? The situation must have been delicate after Izuku had first been taken, yes, but had it really been bad enough to not even  try  and mount a rescue? The more he thought about it, the less sense this made… Unless, perhaps, he wasn’t just taken by All Might? Now that his head wasn’t clouded with rage, he could recall seeing Izuku’s mother present throughout his childhood, appearing calm and carefree. Had she been taken as well, or… Had she been an accomplice? Shigaraki had to know. As he delved into her files, Tomura found that Inko Midoriya’s past was somehow more mysterious than her supposed husband’s. Apparently, she’d kept her maiden name when they’d married, possibly to help keep his master’s cover; though, maybe some sentimentality for her old family had compelled her to this end as well? Perhaps they had disapproved, and convinced her to snatch Izuku away with her when she abandoned her husband? ...Oh. No, that didn’t seem to be the case. She had grown up an orphan, and with a quirk as weak and unremarkable as “attracts small objects”, seemed to have been mostly friendless and unpopular as well. The smiles in her old school photos and social media updates didn’t quite reach her eyes, and they never seemed to twinkle until Sensei began appearing in them at some point in her early twenties. Tomura managed to conjure some of their wedding photos from the portfolio of the photographer he tracked down on the web, and couldn’t help but to smile softly at just how  happy she looked in them.  So, betrayal was out of the question then. Sensei had been the only one to bring her happiness, just as he had for Tomura himself, and she clearly loved him greatly. Maybe she just didn’t know about her husband’s true line of work, and All Might had taken full advantage of that to whisk her and her son away? That must be why Sensei hadn’t gone after them: it would flip their lives upside down and plunge them into chaos. He must love them too much to put them through that kind of misery, so he’d let them go. Oh, his poor Sensei... such a noble sacrifice was almost enough to bring tears to his eyes... What was Inko Midoriya like to enchant All For One like this, he wondered? She must be a wonderful mother, if she’d raised someone as kind and strong as Izuku. He hoped she wasn’t missing her boy too much, though. It was his turn with him now, and soon enough, it would be his father’s. Shigaraki decided he’d like to know more about her now; his curiosity was piqued. Digging further into her file, he eagerly checked the identity of her mother, curious on why she’d been given up in the first place- Only to hit a dead end. Anonymous drop off… she hadn’t even stopped long enough to give her name. Shigaraki scoffed in contempt. This woman had doomed the love of his sensei’s life to a youth of loneliness and misery, and hadn’t even had the decency to even pass on her name? Well, he wasn’t going to let a thing like that stop him. Perhaps if she was still around, they could even have a little chat... Switching tabs, Tomura opened the facial recognition program that Dabi’s contact in the police force had so graciously provided him access to, as well as the security footage from the orphanage the day Inko Midoriya had been dropped off. Ah, there she was… Izuku’s dear old “granny” had been wearing a headscarf and sunglasses that had stayed rudely on even inside the building, but the camera had gotten a very clear shot of her face before she left, wiping her eyes weepily as she went. Ugh, like she’d even  cared . If he was lucky, there should still be just enough data to run a decent scan. He sat back and chugged the last dregs of his coffee as he waited for the results to come in, bouncing his leg impatiently. This was the last thing he’d search up for now; he really should go check to make sure that Dabi and Toga weren’t being too much for Izuku on their first visit. Or, maybe they’d be fine. Even with this coffee, he was actually really tired still. Maybe he’d just nap for the rest of his lunch break and check in on Izuku at dinner... Yeah, it was probably fine... Shigaraki turned back to the aging computer with a yawn at the soft ‘ping!’ of the software completing its analysis and felt the Earth stop turning as he laid eyes on the screen. His mug rolled from his numb fingertips to thunk against the floor, and any thought of sleep evaporated from his mind as he gaped at the impossible words glowing faintly in front of him.

    Chapter Text
    Izuku munched on the crackers he’d been left as a snack, basking in victory. He had managed to pull out a win against the deranged duo who’d just exited his cell, despite starting out with a terrible losing streak. Though, maybe Toga tossed because of her bizarre crush and Dabi did so as well out of pity for his awful poker face? He was happy to let these thoughts distract him as he incorporated all he’d learned from this particularly fruitful encounter into one of his secret texts, and tried desperately to keep his thoughts from wandering to the actions a certain pro hero may or may not have taken. It just… didn’t make any sense… Because if they had spies and traitors that high up the chain, then maybe- He glanced up from his coded writings with a bewildered blink as he heard pounding footsteps racing down the hall, and then nearly jumped out of his skin when he heard the locking mechanism being hastily unlocked. He immediately snapped the book shut and thrust it away from himself in a panic, just in time for the door to slam open and reveal a disheveled Shigaraki who looked just as shocked and panicked as he did. “What’s going on? Did something happen?” Izuku yelped with alarm, not yet daring to hope. Were they being invaded? Could it be that the heroes had found them already? “We need to talk.” The boy’s heart sank. Not a rescue, after all. But then… what could have possibly happened to put Shigaraki in such a state? The boy felt worry begin to build in him as the normally laid-back villain paced back and forth across the cell, looking more tense and serious than he had ever seen him. The silence stretched on for an uncomfortable amount of time, and Izuku felt his concern being compressed steadily into anxiety as he subtly scooted away, wondering if he'd done something to anger the man in front of him. “I found out… who you’re related to.” Izuku’s blood ran cold. He whispered, “Wh-what, you mean...?” The man sat down heavily across from him on the cot with a deep, shaking sigh, raking his hands down his face in an alarmingly intense show of distress. He sat silently like that for a few moments staring at nothing in particular, and Izuku squirmed in his seat at the tension mounting in the room. Finally, he whispered, “It’s me. Izuku...” “I’m your cousin.” Izuku’s jaw probably clattered as it dropped to the floor with enough force to bounce, but he couldn’t hear it over the utter absurdity of the statement ringing through his ears. What on earth could have led him to that conclusion?! The boy stared dumbfounded at his captor like a goldfish, before he managed to reconnect his brain long enough to wet his lips and stammer out, “Y-your…  what -?” Shigarkai suddenly grabbed both his shoulders and shook them so hard his teeth rattled, a mad gleam in his eyes. “We’re cousins! You’re my cousin, and they took you away! That fucking bastard All Might took you away from us!” The boy tried to wrench himself from the other’s grasp, but only succeeded in stopping the violent rocking, as Shigaraki instead clung shivering to his shoulders, head bowed and chest heaving. Izuku was definitely more scared than nervous now; Shigaraki was completely hysterical and in the middle of some kind of episode. If his powers acted up while he was in such a state… “I-It’s ok, it’s ok, calm down…” Deku gently tried to pry the man’s hands off his shoulders, but he just pulled him in to clutch Izuku to his chest as he began wheezing through what must be some kind of panic attack. The boy instead allowed the villain to cling to him like a life ring and rocked him gently back and forth, coaching him through breathing exercises just as if Shigaraki were a panicked citizen. It was impossible. It was just…impossible. For some reason, Shigaraki was absolutely, unshakably convinced  that Izuku was somehow his cousin. Could it be that the stress of running a base full of criminals had gotten to him, and he was having some sort of mental breakdown? The hysterical supervillain in his arms began to calm somewhat, his quaking reduced to slight shuddering. Izuku awkwardly patted his shoulder, unsure of what else to do or say. This wasn’t exactly a position he ever thought he’d find himself in, much less when the hostage element was introduced… “There, there. Uh, maybe you should go take a nap and we can talk about this later?” Shigaraki sniffled and finally released the boy, pulling away and looking more embarrassed than overwrought now. “You seem to be taking this rather calmly, at least. Why is that?” he croaked. In the absence of a good enough lie, Izuku decided to risk the truth. “Yeah… uh, that’s because I don’t believe you. Are you feeling ok? Did-did you get hit in the head or something? It could be that your new powers are acting up somehow.” Not that he didn’t deserve it, if that was the case. It was cruel and insane of him to have accepted those stolen quirks in the first place. ...That is, assuming he’d even had a choice at all. Oh, god... The man sighed dejectedly as he nodded in understanding. “Ah, of course you don’t. I didn’t bring the proof with me did I?” Shigaraki straightened up, moving to sit across from him as he began to explain, “While checking your parents' backgrounds, I found out that your mother had been given up anonymously as a baby. I looked up the footage of when she dropped her off, and when I ran her mother’s face through the facial recognition program… well…” “Turns out that woman was Nana Shimura, my own paternal grandmother.” Izuku couldn’t help the horrified gasp that tore from his throat. “Nana Shimura… is your  grandmother... ?!”  
   Izuku let out a sleepy sigh as he tossed himself onto Gran Torino’s couch, exhausted after several hours of endurance training with One For All. 
   The gleam of a picture frame bouncing light from the setting sunlight into his eye caught his attention, and he dragged himself to his feet as he came closer for a better look, snagging his water bottle off the table and taking a quick chug as he went. 
   There was a strangely familiar dark-haired woman smiling out of the photo at him, alongside a much-younger looking Gran Torino and All Might. An unfamiliar man stood at her side as well, with a hand on her shoulder. 
   “Who’s this?” He asked his teacher, who was currently in the process of microwaving a second batch of taiyaki. 
   “Hm?” Gran turned to him, smiling through a mouthful of the treat, only for it to slip off once he saw what the boy was motioning to.  
   Somberly, he slipped off his seat and wandered over, reaching up to pick the frame up off the shelf and examine it. “This,” he said as he indicated the strong-looking woman, “is Nana Shimura. All Might’s predecessor, and a dear friend of mine.” 
   Izuku’s eyes widened in amazement as he took in her features reverently, now recognizing her from his dreams. “She’s the one who passed One For All on to All Might?” 
   “Yes,” the old man said, “though, I’m afraid you won’t be meeting her any time soon. She died in a fight against All For One, and left me to finish training up that air-headed teacher of yours on my own.” Despite his words, he sounded more mournful than bitter.
   “I see…” Izuku murmured, looking back to the picture. “Who is that next to her?” 
   Gran Torino’s already serious gaze turned morose, and he turned away from Izuku as the microwave chimed an alert that the taiyaki was done. “That was her husband. All For One killed him not long after this photo was taken.” The reply was clipped, with an underlying tone indicating that he’d said all he was willing to say on that subject. Izuku’s stomach twisted with horror and pity for the man grinning alongside Nana. They’d looked so happy together... 
   “But enough about that for now, you’ve rested long enough. Back to training!” 
   “Y-yes, sir!” 
  Now that Izuku was looking closer, there was some resemblance between his idol’s master and the man in front of him. He even had the same mole... Izuku felt an awful concoction of wrath, horror, and disgust twist his insides into knots and pull so tight he doubled over with a hand clutched to his mouth as the reality of the situation slowly sank in. That sick, sadistic…  he knew All For One was a terrible villain, but this was… this was pushing inhuman. He didn't even know it was possible to feel this much disgust for one human being! What kind of vile, reprehensible monster…  The supervillain blinked as Izuku hung his head with his mouth covered, then gave a start when the boy began to sniffle with angry tears. “N-no, no! Hey… uh, don’t cry… I know it’s a lot to take in, but um-” Now it was Shigaraki’s turn to awkwardly console the other, hesitantly placing a hand on the boy’s quivering shoulder. “He ruined you,” Izuku hiccuped, fury and injustice shining wetly in his eyes, “he kidnapped you for the sake of revenge, and he did it in such a way that you wouldn’t even know to hate him… do you even know who Nana  was?” Shigaraki blinked owlishly at him, not understanding his anger, and quirked a brow as he replied, “Well, I know she was a typical hero who abandoned my dad to go save complete strangers, turning him into an asshole.” He then continued with a scowl, “And, for the last time, what happened to my family wasn’t some insane set-up! Sensei  saved  me!” The villain then brought a hand up to grip his chin thoughtfully as another thought occurred to him, and muttered with a star-struck look in his eye, “Oh wait, holy shit! This makes Sensei my uncle, doesn’t it…?” Izuku’s pinwheeling thoughts ground to a halt.  Wait… if he thought that they share a grandmother, and now believed that that bastard was his uncle because of this, then that meant… that meant…! “W-wait… you thought  ALL FOR ONE  was my father?!” Izuku shrieked, absolutely aghast. Just the notion made him want to throw up. What on earth had possessed Shigaraki to think-?! “No,” the madman insisted, looking rather disgruntled at how offended Izuku was over the suggestion, “I still think you’re his son, what with the multiple quirks, and how you chew your lip the same way when you’re nervous, not to mention how similar your hands are, and-“ Izuku bolted to his feet, starting to feel rather hysterical himself as he shouted, “No!  Shigaraki, lots of people bite their lip when they’re nervous, you’re doing it right now! And more importantly, I-I’ve never stolen anyone’s quirk! I would never-!  I’m  nothing like-!” The villain turned to him fully, hard skepticism in his eyes as he countered, “Then how do you suddenly have more than one quirk?!” “Because it was passed on to me!” Izuku shouted, finally losing his cool completely, “The other users, the vestiges-“ he stopped himself suddenly, a hand clapping to his mouth as he was suddenly flooded with shame for revealing such sensitive information to the enemy. The villain’s brow crinkled, and he asked, “What, vestiges…?” The boy curled in on himself, absolutely horrified that he’d revealed such a thing to Shigaraki as the other continued, “Oh! So, you get weird thoughts and urges that have something to do with your new quirks, as well?” “No, I-I didn’t mean to-wait, is that what you’ve been experiencing? Since when?” Deku asked as he jerked upright again to meet the other’s eyes, some of his horror evaporating at the fascinating idea forming in his head. “Did it have something to do with the new powers you got at Jaku?” “It’s not important, don’t worry about it…” Shigaraki waved him away dismissively. Izuku huffed with irritation, both at Shigaraki for cutting him off and at himself for being so easily distracted, and yelled, “You’re right, it’s not! Why won’t you accept that All For One probably only ‘adopted’ you as part of some terrible scheme against All Might and your grandmother?!” Shigaraki looked at him as if he’d grown two heads then immediately started cursing him out with them; incredibly shocked and offended. “No,  you-  !” He cut himself off with a growl of irritation before he ignored Izuku’s statement entirely and went on, “Stop changing the subject! How can  you  be so certain that Sensei isn’t your father if you’ve never even seen his face?” “Because I  have! He shows up all the time in the visions of the past the vestiges show me!” Ok, not exactly honest of him to leave out the fact that he'd never seen the man’s entire face, but he didn’t need to throw more fuel on Shigaraki’s fire here. He was clearly warped beyond reason, and Deku needed to de-escalate before things got any crazier. Izuku was still reeling from the terrible fact that the grandchild of All Might’s predecessor had been raised in All For One’s clutches, never mind the notion that he thought they were cousins. And now, Shigaraki thought he was the ancient fiend’s son as well! What was next, was Spinner going to reveal himself as his long lost brother?! He dropped his head into his hands and tugged at the dark green strands in distress, certain that his head was going to explode if he had to hear one more insane revelation. “Visions of the-?! Ok, you know what? Fine!” Shigaraki spat, seeing that Izuku was clearly overwhelmed, “You don’t have to accept that you might be my master’s kid if you don’t want to just yet because I know you have a lot to take in here,” he wouldn’t, because the notion was completely  insane-  “but I  will  prove to you that we are cousins!” He got up and stalked to the door, communicator in hand, “Doctor, there’s something I need you to do-“ The villainous leader stopped short as Izuku suddenly shot up and grabbed his arm, turning him gently to look imploringly up at him. “Shigaraki, wait. Wait…” Shigaraki gave him his irritated gaze as the teen took a deep breath and continued, “Listen to me. Your grandmother, Nana Shimura, was an enemy of All For One’s,” The man gave him a look of flat skepticism, but Izuku kept going, “She was  All Might’s master. She  trained him .” The man actually snorted with disbelief at that, only for his chuckles to die down at the seriousness in the other’s face. “Are you sure you trust All For One? He never did anything terrible to you, or used you as a guinea pig? Can you look me in the eyes and say that he brought you up in a way that wasn’t sadistic, and that you’re ok?” For a brief moment, an intense look filled with malice and hunger that felt like it was a stranger in Shigaraki’s body overtook his face, and Izuku froze. For ten terrifying seconds, he was almost certain he was about to be attacked. Then, as quickly as it had come, the other seemed to blink it away with conscious effort. “No… no actually, I don’t think I am okay at the moment.” He whispered. Then, he shook his head, continuing, “But still,  that was only a recent development. I stand by what I said; all that stuff about Nana was probably just propaganda they fed you to keep you on their side. Sensei was good to me!” Izuku frowned with dismay; he hadn’t gotten through to him at all, and with that strange behavior he was showing... “It’s ok, though; I’ll have the doctor run some DNA tests that'll prove I’m not lying to you.” The boy let out a huff of dry humor at that; how could he trust that any ‘results’ that were put in front of him were legitimate? “In the meantime, just sit tight, ok? I promise you, zucchini, I’ll help you see the truth. We’ll figure this out, together.” Izuku was then brought in for an entirely unexpected and unasked for bear hug. He grumbled “Ugh, don’t call me zucchini…” into his captor's chest as he patted the others back reassuringly despite the use of the irritating nickname, more to encourage him to let go than anything. Did his new powers come with mood swings as well or something? With a final fond hair ruffle and goodbye, Shigaraki left the room and hurried off, presumably to find the doctor for whatever task he had in mind. As he left, Izuku couldn’t help but be swallowed by pity as he ruminated on the other’s situation. That poor man… if he really was Nana’s grandson, then All For One giving him such an unstable quirk as Decay and raising him as his successor suddenly made a terrible amount of sense. Did All Might or Gran Torino know about any of this…? He sighed shakily and shook it from his head, feeling the adrenaline brought on by the argument seep from his bones. More pressingly, as far as Shigaraki was concerned, Izuku was his precious long-lost younger cousin, and the last of his family since…. he’d accidentally dusted…  Oh. He would be protective of him. Even if it wasn’t true, the idea was firm in his head now that they were family, and he would be so,  so protective of him from here on out. As if he hadn’t been before, as his master’s supposed child…. his ‘Sensei’, who ruined his life and snatched him up as part of a hideous plan to ruin a previous One For All user’s legacy... Izuku stumbled numbly back to the bed, getting under the covers and staring blankly at the ceiling as his thoughts careened through him one after the other like a stampede. Though his mind was jumbled with chaos and confusion and pity and terror, one fact had become apparent with terrible clarity: His window of time to quietly slip away had just slammed shut.  Around midnight, Izuku was awoken by an unexpected visitor. Well, not really awoken. He'd been lying awake and staring at the ceiling as his mind carouseled in circles over all that had happened today, when the lights had suddenly blinked on and blinded him as someone stepped into his room. “Ah, hello Izuku-kun!” The tired but chipper voice of his childhood doctor filled the room. “Apologizes for waking you at such an hour, but I’ve had many things to tend to today and by the time I got to your item on the list, I’d lost track of the time haha.” Izuku nervously sat up to observe the old man coming closer, and felt himself tense at the bag he was holding. “Shigaraki said I didn’t need a checkup…” he reminded him cautiously, his heart rate picking up as Doctor Ujiko remained undeterred as he sat at the foot of his cot and popped his bag open. “Oh, it’s nothing to do with that,” the ex-pediatrician assured him in what the young hero imagined was supposed to be a comforting manner as he rummaged through the aging leather bag, “I’m just here to take some samples.” So saying, the old man produced a frighteningly large syringe and turned to Izuku with a grin. The boy’s eyes widened with alarm, and he scrambled back and away from his childhood doctor to press against the wall as he shouted, “Woah, w-wait, stay away from me!” The doctor sighed and chuckled at him as though he was a small child having a dramatic overreaction to a shot and turned to face him more fully, saying, “Oh, come now, you’ll be fine. This is just to run a DNA test so Tomura-kun can confirm your relation.” The man held out a hand expectantly, and Izuku squinted at it with mistrust, remembering his ‘cousin’s’ strange reaction in the hall. “...Is that really all? You seemed to want me for something else earlier.” The old man sighed and shook his head as he said, “Yes, it really is! If I were up to no good, I wouldn’t have asked so nicely or come in without brute force, now would I?” He scooted a little closer to Izuku, trapping him further against the wall as he insisted, “Just come here so we can get this over with, I still need to prep the surgical theater for Tomura-kun’s procedure before I can sleep.” “Procedure? What procedure?” Izuku asked. The doctor shook his head and snapped his fingers emphatically. Finally, the teen scooted slowly back to the doctor and cautiously offered his arm against his better judgment. He really didn’t want to be going along with whatever was happening right now, but he got the feeling the man would probably result to calling in some goon to restrain him if necessary, and would likely then stop humoring him with conversation. Deku felt he really needed to know what this 'procedure' was all about, so he decided to take his chances with whatever tests the mad doctor wanted to run. Doctor Ujiko slapped the crook of his elbow lightly a few times to draw out the vein. With grace earned from decades of practice, he plunged the needle in correctly on the first try and, replied, “Oh, you see, tomorrow evening, I’m going to be putting dear young Tomura-kun under to work out a few ah…  issues that have been cropping up with his present configuration. He hasn’t been feeling himself since he came out of the tank, you see, so we’re hoping some final adjustments will get everything all smoothed out and working properly again.” Izuku blinked in bewilderment at the unexpectedly straightforward answer. He’d been expecting having to pry to get what he’d wanted. “Uh…” “Why am I telling you this? Oh, no reason,” the madman chuckled, “just making small talk. It’s technically top secret, however, so don’t go gossiping about it now!” He gave the boy a conspiratorial wink as he withdrew the needle from the teen’s arm and capped it, replaced it in his bag and handing him a bandaid. “We’ll get the results of the blood test in oh… three days from now? Maybe as long as a week? Hard to tell with these things sometimes, you know.” The old man stood and straightened his coat, apparently already done with his business. Halfway to the door, a messy sheaf of papers dropped out of the bag and onto the floor. Not wanting any reason to appear suspicious despite his burning curiosity, Izuku called, “Oh, wait! You dropped this.” Doctor Ujiko turned and gave the boy a strange, strained smile as he replied, “Oh, how kind of you, young man! But, I’m afraid I haven’t dropped anything.” He let go of the smiling facade to give him a very serious look, taking the strangely heavy sheaf of papers and closing the young hero’s hands around them gently before turning and heading for the door. “Nothing at all, all right?” Puzzled, Izuku looked down at what he was holding, only for his eyes to nearly pop from his skull. A map of the base, a set of keys…  and... A keycard for his cell.  Izuku sputtered in shock, nearly dropping the precious objects and protesting, “I don’t- y-you- Shigaraki will-!” “Three days from now, Tomura-kun will be put under heavy anesthesia for 12 hours as he undergoes the procedure. It will start at 5:00 am sharp the morning of, so you won’t be seeing him for some time after your evening visit the eve beforehand. I recommend you use that downtime wisely…” The old man turned the door handle and swiped his spare card, not turning back. “Goodnight, Izuku-kun.” “W-wait! Please, why are you helping me?” He could barely speak over the shock, the overwhelming hope and gratitude swelling in his chest. Why was he doing this for him? Didn’t Dr. Ujiko know Shigaraki would be absolutely furious with him for this? Was he a spy for one of the hero agencies, or a traitor? There was so much Izuku wanted to ask. The doctor was already halfway out the door, however. With a sly grin over his shoulder as he turned to close it, he said, “Consider this…”  “A favor for an old friend.”
        Notes:
          Oh my! I bet you guys weren't expecting THAT to be what Ujiko was planning, were you? ;D I wonder why he would do such a thing, though...? :3cUnfortunately, I'm going to be pretty busy from now on, so I may be changing the update schedule so a new chapter goes up once every other Wednesday as opposed to once a week. Though, this may be a good thing, with how long the chapters have been getting; I've been needing more time to work on them anyways, as I can only see them getting longer from here. :')Any updates on this will be on my tumblr at windyskyes.tumblr.com, under the Paradigm Shift tag.Kudos and comments are appreciated. Thank you for reading, and have a good two weeks!! &lt;3

    Chapter Text
   Nana Shimura tore through the sky like a bullet, racing to get home in time. 
  He had found them. All For One  knew  she had a family and where to find them, had taunted her with this information before setting off for a self-imposed “visit”, and she’d already wasted precious minutes she didn’t have to rescue citizens and disarming the bomb he’d left her.  
   She’d had to choose between stopping his scheme, saving innocent lives in the process, and running home to protect her own family, and…  well, there had been no other heroes in the area to cover for her, and a bomb of that caliber could wipe out a city block. As much as it chilled her blood, she couldn’t just abandon her duty for the sake of personal interest! She had informed the heroes patrolling near her home of the situation, futile though it may be, and focused on doing what she could where she was at. 
   Thank God Kotaro was safe, at least. One of the teacher aides had said he could see her boy playing in the preschool yard from the window when he’d answered her call, and had kindly stayed on the line with her until a hero could escort them to a shelter after she’d warned of a potential villain attack. 
   If he hadn’t gone for Kotaro, however, then that meant... 
  No.   Focus   . Keep going!   Finally, she arrived at their apartment complex. She set down on the balcony and didn’t even bother knocking or fumbling out her keys and instead burst through    the oh god, it was already open   balcony door with a cry of “Darling?!” on her lips. Her heart raced at the unnatural stillness that greeted her, and she began searching the premises room by room, feeling certain that her own dread would strangle her as she gulped in great breaths of air.  
   No, she needed to keep calm. No jumping to conclusions before she had any hard evidence; he could be out getting groceries, or been called into work on his day off, or- 
   Finally, she made it to the master bedroom, and felt herself go numb at the nightmarish, grisly sight her nemesis had painted, just for her. Her knees buckled under her, and she covered her mouth with a mute cry of horror. 
   Above the headboard, a mocking message was spelled across the wall: 
   ‘Wrong choice, Mrs. Shimura.’ 
   Her husband was dead, and it was all her fault. 
 Izuku jerked violently awake with a ragged gasp, heart pounding as he shot bolt upright in his cot. A dream… it had all just been another dream. With a relieved and exasperated sigh, Deku collapsed into the mountain of pillows at his back, noting how sweat-dampened they had become. He had gone ahead and crafted the wedge that would disable the quirk suppression device and worn it to bed so he could acclimate to the constant pressure on his wrist should he choose to run, and he supposed the return of the vestige’s visions had meant it’d worked throughout the night. As he swam through the fog of sleep and returned to reality gazing up at the soft predawn light, his mind returned to the thoughts that had been plaguing him before he’d slept: the doctor’s offer. For reasons Izuku couldn’t even begin to fathom, the medical officer of the base had risked his position, possibly even his  life  to offer him the means to escape. His seemingly casual mention of Shigaraki’s surgery three days from now had been no accident, either; clearly, he was telling the boy of the best time to carry out an escape attempt alongside being given a key and map to the base. Izuku had practically been handed his freedom on a silver platter! Still… it all felt too good to be true. Why would the old man take such a risk? Was he a double agent? Some kind of spy for the commission? Had he done it as a favor to him as an old patient, as he’d seemed to suggest? Or… could it be he was concerned about his current employer’s state of mind? Just the night before, Shigaraki had informed him of their supposed… connection. Deku wasn’t quite sure if he believed it was true; he knew it was  possible  , of course, but what were the odds that All Might and All For One just so  happened to stumble upon successors from the same family tree? More to the point, he and Shigaraki were just nothing alike. Was that why the doctor was giving him an out to his captivity? Because his being here was somehow encouraging this adverse state of mind in his current employer? Well, in the end it didn’t matter why he had it, he supposed as he stumbled out of bed to start in on his morning exercise stretches. What mattered was that he had a chance to escape, a real,  solid  chance to escape, and how he was going to use it. If he even should. Izuku paused mid-stretch. Potential familial relations aside… he might be Shigaraki’s only hope of escaping the villain mentality he’d been spoonfed for the better part of his life. Would he be abandoning him, failing him as a hero if he went ahead and left…? Although at this point, the man surely couldn’t blame him; gifts and kind words or no, he had still been taken and was being held here  against his will.  Izuku finished his morning yoga and chugged a glass of water from the sink. He then moved on to the warmup portion of his training. Just because Shigaraki thought Izuku was related to him because this Nana Shimura heroine might be his grandmother- He froze mid-crunch as the full implications of that statement finally hit him. Nana Shimura. Who had been All Might's mentor and predecessor, the one to start his journey to greatness. Nana Shimura, whose grandson had been taken by All For One as part of some cruel agenda against the descendant of a One For All user. Nana Shimura, whose hair All Might had remarked was similar to his mother’s.  Izuku sat up and stared into his lap, running a hand through his hair in shock at the overwhelming rush of emotions that threatened to capsize him. Shock, elation, guilt, horror… could it be, could he  actually  be related to the woman who gave his idol his start?  And, as someone who could potentially be his only living family member left and able to care, wasn’t Izuku more obligated than  anyone  to save Shigaraki? if not for the pale-haired man’s sake, then for the sake of the others he would affect as well as for Nana’s legacy? Wasn’t he  responsible for his cousin, if it was true? The doctor had said the results of the blood test could take up to a week… and he only planned to stay for three days. If he left when given the chance, Deku might never know for sure. He was positive that the uncertainty would haunt him... Consumed as he was with his thoughts, he jumped awake a little at the polite knock on his door. The boy glanced at his clock and raised his eyebrows; whoever was coming in with breakfast, they were quite early!  “Surpriiiiise~!” Toga burst in without further prompting and a small plate of cupcakes that were toppling over onto themselves with too much icing, grinning widely. The boy blinked up at her, bewildered. “...Uh, thank you…?” Who had cupcakes for breakfast? Izuku accepted one of the sugary treats and hazarded a guess, “Uh, is there any occasion for you bringing these? Is it someone’s birthday or something?” “Noooope!” Toga replied with a sweet smile, “Just felt like it!” The boy quirked an eyebrow, mildly suspicious. “Ah, I see.” Then, he felt his stomach rumble. Surely, if the villains had wanted to poison him, they would have done so by now. And probably with something far less suspicious, too! So thinking this, Deku shrugged and took a bite, only to nearly spit it out in shock. Th-this wasn’t a cupcake at all! “This a muffin!” He choked, doing his best not to hock up his mouthful at the unpleasant fusion of flavors. With some effort of will, he chewed and swallowed it down. “Yeah, that’s the surprise!” The girl chirped happily bouncing up and down gleefully. “Do you like it~?” Izuku sighed; of course. He should’ve expected something like this from the get-go when the strange girl wandered into his cell unmonitored. Although, icing aside, it wasn’t all that bad. Not at all. He took another bite along the side to avoid the icing, mulling the unusual taste over and trying to place the flavor. “Yeah, they’re pretty good, actually. What kind are they? I’ve never tasted this flavor of muffin before.” The girl giggled and clapped her hands, clearly beside herself with mirth, “Oh, Dabi saw them while putting together an online shopping list and thought it would be funny to buy them. They’re zucchini bread!” Oh, that  bastard . Toga’s uproarious laughter at the sight of his sour face echoed throughout the cell and all the way down the hall. 
 Shigaraki fussed with his disguise for the fifth time since leaving the base, slightly nervous. It was such a huge risk for him to go out now before things could settle down a bit and he knew it, but… he had an aunt out there. Izuku’s mother. He just  had to meet her. So, after making sure things wouldn’t fall apart during his little day trip and snagging Toga in the hall to make sure Izuku got breakfast, he was off. (He was sure she’d be fine alone with him. He’d been  very clear  on the fact that she couldn’t bring any kind of pointy or sharp object, and strictly forbade stabbings of any kind, no matter how “cute he looked covered in blood”. Izuku’d be  fine . Probably...) Well, calling it a  day  trip may be a bit of a stretch. To minimize his chances of being caught, he’d left before the sun had even begun to touch the horizon. By the time he arrived at the apartment complex, the first fingers of predawn sunlight were just barely brushing over the skyline. Tomura double-checked the address as he climbed the stairs stealthily. Near the top, he looked out at the view Izuku would have had leaving his home as a child. Out beyond the parking lot, he could see a small, familiar playground. Not far from there was a worn dust path leading to a park, as well as a gated-off forest that a tiny Bakugou had coaxed the boy into a number of times in the tapes. All in all, it seemed like a nice, perfectly ordinary place to grow up. Well… If you were believed to have a quirk, that is. With a scowl, the man mounted the last set of stairs and finally arrived at the Midoriya residence. It was unremarkable, with nothing noteworthy that made it stand out from the other units at its side. At the foot of the door, a well-worn mat read “Welcome!” Shigaraki crouched in front of the entrance and began to fiddle with the lock, the old skill coming back comfortably despite how much time had passed since he’d last used it on his early assignments from Sensei. As he did so, he did his best to brace himself; Inko Midoriya had seemed like a kind, gentle woman in the recordings, but… she was still his father’s sister. Behind closed doors, she might be just as cruel. His heart clenched at the thought of Izuku being made to endure what he had; though, perhaps in his case, the motivation was backwards. Perhaps she had forced him into being a better hero than her negligent mother, instead of banning the topic outright as his own father had? That was the other reason for this visit, the true reason if he was being honest with himself. For his cousin’s sake, he had to know. Finally, the lock gave with a tiny ‘click!’ that felt deafening in the dewy stillness. Slowly, carefully, the villain eased the door open and slipped inside, politely kicking off his shoes at the entrance. Socks  were  less noisy than sneakers, after all. He’d just gotten it shut and relocked when he jerked his head up at the strangled gasp that shattered the silence. Standing there in the kitchen at 4:16 in the morning was Inko Midoriya. She looked remarkably more haggard and aged than she had in the recordings, and seemed to have not slept a wink this night despite the dark pink robe she was wearing over her bedclothes.  Her hair was messy and bedraggled, oily strands drooping into wide, familiar green eyes that had heavy bags under them, as though it had been days since they’d seen sleep. The middle-aged woman had frozen midstep exiting her kitchen with a steaming mug of what smelled like tea clutched tight in her quivering hands. She was making the same expression of mute horror her brother had worn in his final moments. “Y-you…” She whispered, barely above a breath. A heavy blanket of tension covered the apartment, the ringing silence broken only by the tinkling of a neighbor’s wind chime outside. Inko swallowed dryly and straightened her back to shakily say, “You’re the one who took my son, aren’t you?” Shigaraki breathed, and nodded. “Yeah. That’s me.” A hand came up to scratch at his neck nervously for the first time since his enhancement; Inko made the same face her brother had made when looking at something they hated, too… The older woman’s eyes hardened at his confession, and the resemblance between her and Izuku was so striking Shigaraki couldn’t help but crack a small smile. She then sniffled and wiped at her eyes, choking out, “Well, go on then. Get it over with.” The criminal blinked, shaken out of his reverie at her unexpected reaction. “What?” He asked. Inko sighed with irritation and set her mug down on the counter with a hard ‘clank!’, and it was only then that Tomura noticed her hands had been shaking badly enough to make her spill. “Do whatever it is you came here to do. Kidnap me, torture me, kill me, I don’t care! Just please,  please  don’t do anything to my son. God, you can do whatever you’d like to me but don’t hurt my baby, for whatever reason you’ve taken him, I’m begging you!” By the time she’d finished pleading, Inko had dropped the strong mask she’d been trying to keep up and broken down into wailing sobs as she hid her face behind her scalded hands.  Ah. Of course. She thought he was here to use her as some kind of leverage against Deku. Shigaraki had known this was the likeliest solution she’d jump to, but had been hoping that they could just have a calm, civil discussion over a nice cup of morning coffee without any unnecessary drama. Now, he supposed it had been too much to hope for. Perhaps he’d gotten a little too used to dealing with hardened criminals lately... Tomura sighed softly and shook his head, stepping closer slowly as one would approach a wounded animal. “No, hey now. It’s okay, I’m not here to hurt you. And your kid is fine, we’re not hurting him, either, promise. Let’s get those burns taken care of, and then we can sit and speak rationally about-” His good hand brushed her wrist as he went to tug her hands down, but she suddenly smacked him away hard, snarling, “Rationally?! Was there anything rational about how you took my Izuku away for the sake of some…  blood feud?! ” “No,” Shigaraki growled, and did his best to hold his anger in as he snappily clarified, “I didn’t take Izuku for whatever reason  you’re  talking about. I took him because… well, because we’re family, Midoriya-san.” Mrs. Midoriya’s eyes widened, and she stopped struggling to free her wrist from the young man’s grasp. She instead took a step back to stare at him with the same look of incredulous disgust Izuku has given him. Ah, they really were  so  alike. “...  What? ” She hissed. “Come on, let’s treat those burns first. I’ll answer your questions afterwards. And please, don’t think I’m trying to trick you. We both know if I came here to hurt you I would have done so already, and I assure you wouldn’t risk coming out of hiding now for anything less than this,” He murmured, pulling her gently to the sink and turning the water on cold. Inko blinked down at her hands with a surprised wince, as though she hadn’t felt the pain until he’d brought it up. Then, she turned to stare at the villain as he dressed her wound, taking in his features with a measure of recognition dawning in her eyes as she scanned his features. She let Shigaraki help treat the mild burns and fix two new mugs of tea without a fight before they both took a seat across from each other on the living room couches. At the look of grim expectancy he was given when the woman was ready, Shigaraki began, “When I took your son, it was on the suspicion that he was related to… someone very important to me. When we looked into it further, however, we… well, with the use of facial recognition technology, we identified the woman who dropped you off anonymously at the orphanage. Her name was Nana Shimura, my paternal grandmother and the woman who dumped you and my dad into state custody to go play hero.” “Paternal...I-I have a brother?” Inko gasped reverently, barely hearing the latter half of his sentence as her eyes sparkled, “Where is he? Is there anyone else in the family? Can I meet them? Or, are they all… like you?” Villains, hung unsaid in the air. “No,” Shigaraki grunted as he tore his eyes away from her hopeful, apprehensive face to force down a sip of tea, “No, I’m afraid you can’t meet them. When I was very young, about five, I-” He grit his teeth and swallowed down the truth that wanted to come out; it would be of no help to him here. “-they… passed away…” he said instead measuredly, his eyes roaming the living room as he carefully avoided her gaze. “I’m the only one who was left. I’m sorry.” His insides squirmed uncomfortably at the way Inko’s face crumpled with horror and despair at losing her long-lost family before she could even meet them. She cried, “Wh-what? But then, why wasn’t I informed?! Did you have to grow up in an orphanage or on the streets because nobody could reach me, because I didn’t try to reach out in time? How can I know you’re not doing this as part of some scheme to hurt Izuku through me?” Her eyes filled with tears, and Tomura felt a wave of panic at the unexpected show of compassion despite her great mistrust of him. “No, I’m telling the truth, really! I swear it! And I was quickly adopted by someone incredible, so don’t worry.” Inko seemed to believe him but was unsatisfied by his answer, and his heart pinched as he realized how willing she would have been to take him in as a child had someone,  anyone  intervened and gotten him to a police station like a responsible adult. Or, better yet, had a certain  “hero”  not stolen Sensei’s family out from under him. He and Izuku really could’ve been raised as brothers…  With a deep breath, Tomura continued, “What matters is that since I’m pretty sure that Izuku is my cousin, that... makes you my aunt.” Inko’s eyes popped wide open as the revelation of  why  he was here finally hit her. The mug of warm tea that she’d just brought to her lips began quivering slightly between her fingers again as she whispered, “You’re here to take me away, aren’t you?” Tomura held her gaze and corrected gently, “Not quite; I’m here to  invite you to join us, to come be with your family. If you turn me down, then I’ll disappear, and we can pretend this encounter never happened.” The dark-haired woman covered her mouth in shock, averting her eyes as an intense analytical gleam entered them at his words. She was quiet for a long, long while after that, and when she spoke again her tone was hushed and shaky. Hesitant. “If you want me to go with you, then why… why are you even asking? Why not just kidnap me, like you did with Izuku?” The pinch between her brows indicating cautious consideration was one he had become quite familiar with lately; it was almost identical to Izuku’s. Shigaraki gave her a small smile and replied simply, “I want you to join us willingly so Izuku will be more comfortable. You’re my family too now, and I want us all to be together on the same side; I wouldn’t be a very good nephew or cousin if I just locked you all up until you agreed with me, however. As his mother, you must have noticed; ever since he began going to that so-called ‘school’ his physical and mental health have been a wreck. He’s constantly under pressure and in mortal danger, more so than any kid his age should ever be. It’s how I caught him in the first place, for pity’s sake!” He cried, throwing his arms out emphatically. Then, he continued, “If we can use this opportunity to pull him out now, then there’ll still be time to redirect him to a different path, with a better future. I’m not asking that you or he become villains; I’m asking that you help him step away from this dangerous, ugly lifestyle he’s trying to pursue to become something better. You don’t want him to follow the same career path that led to your orphaning in the first place, do you?” He stood, and offered her his hand, “Come with me, and you can see your son again, and never have to fear for his life or well-being like this ever again. If we go now, we might even arrive before lunchtime! Doesn’t that sound nice, Auntie?” Her eyes widened and her jaw gradually fell further and further throughout his proposal. For a fleeting moment, Tomura was filled with desperate hope as her expression shifted to something like temptation before suddenly hardening despite the despair, longing, and heartbreak now shining in her eyes. She dropped her gaze. She had given him his answer without words. “No?” He asked, just to be sure, his extended arm drooping. “No,” Inko confirmed, wiping her moistened eyes again. He let his arm fall fully to the side and hissed out a breath through his teeth as he brought the other one up to rake through his vibrant hair, heavy disappointment settling in his chest. “...I don’t suppose there’s anything I can do to change your mind? I don’t want to separate Izuku from you like this, and as one of the two genetic family members I have left, I really would like to get to know you. What does this life have that I can’t give you?” Tomura asked, feeling irrationally hurt and somewhat petulant despite himself. She had barely known him for half an hour and he had taken away her son, of course she wouldn’t want to give him a chance... The despondent mother sniffled and took a brief sip of her tea again as she answered, “It’s not about what you can give me. It’s about the promise I made to Izuku.” Shigaraki gave her a puzzled look, and she took a slower, deeper swig from her warm mug before continuing, “I’m staying because it’s Izuku’s dream to become a hero, and so long as that’s the future he wants to chase, I’ll always be there to support him.” A gentle smile graced her features that were lit by the rays of the newly-risen sun as she finished resolutely, “That’s my job, as his mom... Even if I’m trying to succeed where this supposed Nana failed, and even if it’s for the same career that made her give me up in the first place. Just because those before us made terrible mistakes doesn’t mean we can’t try to do better!” Tomura clenched his fists at the unexpected pang of jealousy that burned through him. She was absolutely  nothing  like his father… Izuku’s mother truly loved him so, so much. “...I see.” “Can I ask you one more question before I go, then?” Inko nodded as she finished off her drink, shoulders relaxing a bit at the mention of his leaving. “If you don’t mind my asking, who is your husband, and what does he do for a living?” Instantly, the housewife’s eyes sharpened with intense suspicion, but she answered without any sign of dishonesty all the same, “Oh, well, he’s just a regular businessman named Hisashi Midoriya. He’s been working in America for quite some time now, so I doubt you’d be able to meet with him as you have with me.”  Hisashi Midoriya… an alias. So then, she didn’t know about Sensei’s true profession. Shigaraki frowned at the unexpected answer; why would Sensei go as far as marrying and having a child with her if he hadn’t even told her what he truly did yet? Had their kidnappers wiped or altered her memory somehow? Or perhaps, he kept Inko in the dark to protect her, and whatever forces separated them took advantage of that? Or maybe, just maybe… he had been wrong? His worrisome contemplation came to a screeching halt as the sound of boots thundering up the stairs of the apartment complex obliterated the calm of the early morning. Shigaraki stiffened as his eyes flew to Mrs. Midoriya’s suddenly tense form and carefully blank face, and he immediately stalked around the coffee table to check her pockets despite her stuttered protests. Her phone was nestled in one of her bathrobe pockets and warm, too warm, when he plucked it out and checked the screen. It had been on call with 110, the  police , this entire time. “Well, seems like I’m out of time to visit with you, then.” He snapped, feeling very cross with her. Tomura tossed his aunt her phone which she flinched violently away from and dropped with a startled shriek at his suddenly unnaturally quick movements. Without looking back to see this, Shigaraki made his way swiftly to the balcony after grabbing his shoes with a quick snap of his tentacle quirk and snarled to Inko, “Thank you for your time, Mrs. Midoriya. I’m hoping you change your mind one day, but until then, I’m afraid Izuku and I won’t be able to keep in touch.” He wrenched the sliding glass door straight off its lock with barely an effort just as the first of the emergency response team burst through the front door, and muttered, “I hope you don’t regret this decision one day. Goodbye, Inko-san.” As he sprung off the balcony and soared high above the clouds before the heroes could catch him, he privately thought with regret, ‘But, I really do hope we meet again.’ 
 Twelve hours later, after going in and out of interrogation rooms and having many long, intense discussions with several different detectives, police captains, and hero officials, Inko Midoriya was finally cleared to go home. Getting up the stairs to her apartment was as daunting as climbing a mountain, and when she finally stumbled through the door she kicked her shoes off and didn’t bother finding any slippers to put on. With a tired moan, the small greenette collapsed onto the couch and threw a heavy arm over her aching eyes. Inko was feeling many things at the moment; stressed, terrified,  exhausted  , but more than anything she felt a crushing, guilty helplessness at how little she’d been able to really  do  to help the investigation along. Oh, she’d had her baby’s kidnapper  right there within arm’s reach, and had barely done a thing to catch him. Maybe, if she’d just played along and asked where they would be going, or snuck her phone onto his person somehow... The gentle woman sniffled dryly, fighting back the tears she barely had the strength to cry. No, no more tears; they wouldn’t help her or her boy now. Still, it was difficult; even if his kidnapper had assured her of Izuku’s safety, how was she meant to take his word for it? 
   Family… he had said we’re family… 
 Inko sat up as a thought occurred to her. Nana Shimura, the woman who had allegedly abandoned her on the orphanage doorstep all those years ago… if she was real, then she should have public records in her koseki that could verify at least some of what Shigaraki said. It may not help her find her boy, but it was better than sitting around moping and crying over things she couldn’t control. Besides, who knew? She might just find something that could be used against her diabolical self-proclaimed nephew in there, as well. One sugar-ladened coffee and quick cup noodle dinner later, Inko began her lengthy research into the family she never knew she’d had. 
 Izuku sighed morosely as he took another nibbling bite of his third (admittedly strangely delicious, so long as he avoided the icing) zucchini bread muffin, numb fingers of his long-dead left arm twitching at the vice-like grip Toga had wrapped around his arm like a koala. “...and that’s why I think pig blood is better than cow’s blood. Ok, your turn!” They had been sitting like this for the better part of two hours, and her chattering had yet to cease. She had insisted on playing a game of back and forth twenty questions with him as they ate, and while it had started out fascinating, he was quickly growing tired of it. He had a cramp from sitting like this for so long, his left ear was starting to hurt from the constant stream of noise... he kinda had to pee. And frankly, some of the things she was telling him were rather… unsettling. “Hey, not to be rude, but uh… why are we playing this again?” The boy asked with a strained smile, praying he wouldn’t set her off somehow. Toga giggled and covered her blushing cheek with one hand, replying coyly, “I want to get to know you, so I can become you!” Deku’s eyes widened, and he leaned towards her with a small smile of his own as he eagerly inquired, “Oh! You want to become more like me? Like, as in become a hero?” This was  fantastic ! If he could recruit one of the league’s members to his side, then maybe staying and offering her the support she needed to leave would be worth it after- “No, no!” she said shaking her head emphatically, “I don’t just want to  be  like you. I wanna turn  into  you! That’s the normal way for me to show love, silly!” Saying this, she nuzzled her face into her bicep, hugging him even tighter and sighing happily at their proximity. “Oh,” he said, his voice a deadpan of confusion. “I see.” it was hopeless. He just couldn’t understand her, try as he might. Although… perhaps this was some kind of physiological consequence of her quirk? If it needed blood to activate, and allowed her to physically take the form of whoever (maybe even  whatever  ?) she drank from, then maybe she felt  compelled  to drink blood? And, taking that a step further, if she was being compelled to drink blood, then perhaps some wires were crossed and she felt that as a strange sort of  attraction  for her intended victim? Of course, she could have also had some kind of traumatic experience while young, and her associations- Himiko giggled, and interrupted his train of thought with, “Hehehe, you’re cute when you mumble!” He snapped his jaw shut as his cheeks reddened slightly in embarrassment, which she cooed and giggled at while pinching one harshly between her fingers. Alright, enough was enough. She had officially overstayed her welcome. He grabbed her wrist and tugged it away from his face, asking gently, “Toga-chan, isn’t there anything else you’d rather be doing right now? It’s getting pretty late for a morning visit. I mean, you must have some important role to play at the base here that I’m keeping you from, right?” Instead of the enthusiastic or resigned response he’d anticipated, the girl’s eyes narrowed and met his own suspiciously. “You’re not trying to boot me out, are ya?” Her lip pulled down into a pout as she tugged the arm he’d been slowly trying to ease out of her grasp closer, and Deku held in a frustrated huff. “No, I just-isn’t there  something  you need to be doing, somewhere else?” He winced at how poorly that had come out. Her gaze shifted into outright affrontedness, then morphed into something alarmingly mischievous. “Yeah, actually,” she said, coy grin never leaving her face, “I  was  told to do something important today, now that you mention it.” The boy released a small breath of relief, unsure if any celebration was premature or not still. “Oh, good. What is it?” “Training YOU!” She yelled, yanking up the pillow she’d had behind her back and whacking him hard with it, right in the face. “Ow!” The boy yelped, feeling the zipper smack into his cheek. “PILLOWFIGHT~!” Toga’s battle cry rang throughout the cell, and despite what she’d just declared she seemed to be intent on attacking him with anything and everything that was lying around the cell. “Loophole! Loophole! It’s a loophole!” She cackled madly, swiping har razor-sharp nails for his exposed wrist and missing by an inch as Deku stumbled away and took a book to the side of his head instead. “Oof! Hey, quit it!” The young hero scrambled up off the cot and away from the maniacal teen girl hurling his few worldly comforts at him; not even the plush bunny was spared from the onslaught. The already crumbling remains of the muffin toppled from his grasp with the icing-slathered side splatting to the floor, and his carefully organized book setup was quickly dismantled and used as ammunition. In a matter of seconds, his tiny cell had transformed into an absolute warzone! Izuku dodged and weaved successfully as he backpedaled, taking cover behind his wooden divider as adrenaline raced through his veins. Was it alright to fight back? Would he be blamed if someone walked in and saw a battle going on between him and one of his captors? What if in the midst of all this chaos, she saw one of his hidden entries or found his cell keycard?! Deku clutched the side of his makeshift shield to hold it in place against the multiple books thudding against it and demanded, “Toga-chan, knock it off! We’re making a huge mess!” The girl in question only giggled louder and skipped up to where he’d backed himself into a corner. “Nooope! I’m not gonna go easy on you just because you’re cute~!” She sing-songed as her sharp nails darted for the fingers poking out to grasp the divider in place. He gasped more in surprise than in pain as she grazed his knuckles, then promptly had a particularly large cushion dunked on his head. Izuku growled and made up his mind. Quirkless or not, he wasn’t going to sit here and be pummeled into submission by his own pillows! And, at the very least, he might distract her enough to keep her eyes from wandering to anything incriminating… “Alright, that’s enough. You want a fight? I’ll give you a fight!” The boy roared, charging out from behind cover to the other teen’s squeal of absolute delight. Deku wound up sparring with her in this way for what felt like hours, despite the clock indicating it had only been about one. He desperately dodged and counter-attacked as best he could in what little space they had, until finally a knock sounded at the door heralding lunch. Toga chirped, “Come in!” as her unwilling sparring partner bent double, hands clutching his knees as he struggled to catch his breath. Not that Toga herself was doing much better; she was just as winded as he was, and let herself collapse onto the cot with a worn-out grin. “Hey, what’s going on in here?” Dabi popped his head in with a quirked eyebrow, and at the sight that greeted him it’s twin shot up to join its brother near the top of his brow. “Uh… you guys good?” The man asked casually, but from the sharp glance he shot Toga his real message was clear: was there an escape attempt in progress? The girl giggled and flopped backwards on the rickety bed, kicking her slipper-clad feet playfully as she replied, “Yep! I was just puttin’ the prisoner through his paces, just how the boss told me to!” The flame wielder snorted and said, “Uh, you know he meant for you to do that with the others, right? An hour from now? In the training room? ” “Oh, pshh! This is close enough!” Toga waved a hand at him dismissively, and Izuku felt his irritation rise; she wasn’t even supposed to be doing this in the first place, and now his room was a mess! Dabi snorted and held the door open, saying, “Well, I bet you worked up an appetite. There’s more pizza in the kitchen.” Belatedly, Izuku realized Dabi was balancing a pizza box in his off hand. Toga was totally out of breath behind him, and the other villain had his hands full... If he could just slip by- His eyes darted up to the taller man’s face to see him staring right back at him, face bored but eyes gleaming with a sadistic sparkle. ‘ Do it,  ’ they seemed to say, ‘  Go ahead. Today has been boring so far. Give me a reason to make something interesting happen, kid. ’ Izuku looked down, crossing his arms and tucking his hands into his pits non-threateningly as he grumbled, “You could at least help clean up in here first.” “Of course, I’d love to!” Himiko cheered. Dabi entered the room fully and didn’t bother locking the door behind him, clapping Izuku on the back as he passed. ‘ Good choice. ’ Facing away from both of them, Deku winced. With the three of them working together, it only took them a few minutes to get the room back into some semblance of order, the boy buzzing with anxiety the entire time that one of them would stumble on his hidden stash or an incriminating entry in one of the books. Thankfully, they never did, and Dabi even managed to shoo Toga out of the room by promising that one of the other pizzas had come with a free order of brownies. “Ahh, why didn’t you say so earlier?! ‘Destro’s gonna eat them all!” She cried, scrambling from the room and running down the hall without so much as a goodbye. “W-wait, who is-?” Deku unthinkingly made as if follow her out the door, but Dabi’s vice grip grabbed him and pulled him back through as he swiftly relocked it. “A-ah, sorry…” Izuku murmured, ducking his head and hoping he hadn’t earned any kind of punishment. Or, god forbid, a sweep of the cell. The other did no such thing, however, and just gave him a sly grin as he asked, “So, you two were just training… is that all that happened, or has Toga finally managed to nab herself a boyfriend?” Izuku squawked and sputtered at the suggestion, and Dabi laughed at his reddening ears. Then, he crossed the room to return to the still-warm pizza box. “Now then,” he said, lifting the lid and revealing a familiar game console lying alongside the pizza, “Did she completely wear you out with that fight, or are you up for a few rounds of Smash while we eat?” 
 Finally, as Dabi left, relocked the door behind him, and strode on down the hall, Izuku stretched out on his bed with a happy sigh, feeling warm and sleepy. It had been quite awhile since he’d gotten a proper workout, and a few rounds of virtual sparring with the dark-haired man had been a perfect way to wind down. With a jolt of realization, he found the plastered-on smile he put up to wave Dabi out the door was still on his face. It had been sincere… he hadn’t had to force it at all that time. When he stopped to think about it, he was disturbed to find he was actually...  sad  the pair had gone, despite what he’d been put through. He  missed them, in much the same way he missed his real friends on a daily basis. With a gnawing sense of horror, Izuku realized he was actually looking forward to when the villains would come to visit him in his cell next. Was this Stockholm syndrome setting in? Had he already been so affected by the isolation of being kept under lock and key that he wanted to see more of the very people who’d trapped him here?! Izuku wrapped his arms around himself and rolled to stare at the wall, deeply worried. Despite being villains, despite all the terrible things they’d done, he was still slowly becoming  friends with them. Guilt clawed at his stomach as Deku imagined what his mentors and classmates would say to him if they knew. He was certain that even his mother would be disgusted with him for he was acting. Not even a week ago, these people had ruined so many lives, and yet here he was, laughing and playing with them as if nothing was wrong... Wanting to escape these uncomfortable thoughts and feelings, the boy decided to squeeze in a quick nap before going back to pondering what he should do when the big day rolled around. Of course, he first made sure to stash the leftover pizza in a freshly-eviscerated pillowcase under his cot mattress while leaving out the empty cardboard container to fool his captors; he’d need all the calories he could get if he chose to run, after all. However, between the restless night before, the long battle with Toga, and a warm belly full of junk food, what he had intended to be a small nap stretched on much further than a few minutes. When he finally blinked his sand-filled eyes open, Izuku was momentarily confused by the soft early morning light coming in above him. Wasn’t it just midafternoon a moment ago…? His eyes popped as he suddenly realized what had happened; he must have slept all the way through to the next day! It was the hardest he’d slept since arriving here. He sat up with a yawn and stretched, looking around to see if anything was different. Someone had even come into his room to kindly leave a bowl of veggie stir fry for him in the night, and he hadn’t so much as stirred at the intrusion. The teen quietly stashed it with the pizza beneath his cot as well, quelling the irrational guilt that wanted to bubble up at the dishonest action; there was nothing  generous about leaving him a meal as he slept when they were keeping him here against his will… If anything, he should see it as creepy! Now, he only had two days to think things over, and he was no closer to reaching a decision than the day before. He was still debating back and forth with himself when a knock to his cell door once again signaled the end of his alone time. This time, it was Shigaraki who visited his cell with some delicious-smelling omurice for his consumption, though he didn’t surrender it before pulling Deku in for a rough, playful noogie. Bastard. “You sleep well? You passed out early on us last night! And Re-Destro was  so looking forward to meeting you, too.” Shigaraki chuckled as Izuku shoved him away with a scrunched up nose. “Yeah, I slept fine. And who’s Re-Destro?” Thesame person Toga had mentioned yesterday... Shigaraki waved a hand dismissively and replied, “Oh, just a new colleague of mine. Don’t worry about it.” He handed Izuku his plate, and the boy dropped the topic with a shrug, trying not to dwell on the fact that he’d had a total stranger come into his room while he’d been sleeping. They ate in companionable silence for a little while after that, a strangely faraway look taking up Shigaraki’s eyes as he became lost in his ponderings. “Say, Izuku,” The man asked suddenly, “Can I ask… why did you decide you wanted to be a hero?” The boy lowered the fork that was halfway to his mouth, stunned by the question. Then, he brought it back up to his mouth and replied cautiously around a cheekful of egg, “Well... it’s what I’ve always wanted to be. For as long as I can remember, I’ve always wanted to protect and help and inspire people the way that All Might does.” A fond, warm twinkle entered the boy’s eyes as he talked about his dream and idol. “Even when everyone around me told me I couldn’t do it, it was still all I ever wanted.” Shigaraki snorted as if he’d heard a bad joke. “Why be a hero if you want to help others? Everything they’ve done these past few decades has caused so many more problems than can be solved. It’s why we should just tear it all down and be done with it. The whole system is rotten, right down to the very core,” He said, dabbing some omurice into his ketchup and popping it into his mouth. Izuku goggled at him with complete bafflement, more than a little offended. Just what had All For One said to twist his mind around like that?! “... How does any of what you just said make any sense at all? How does  saving people cause problems?!” He cried. Try as he might, the teen couldn’t quite keep the notes of petulance and disdain from his tone. Shigaraki side-eyed him contemplatively as he chewed his food, before answering slowly, “...Do you remember when Bakugou-kun was taken hostage by that slime-bodied villain, way back before you were enrolled in UA?” Izuku blinked, thrown off by the non sequitur, and replied, “Uh, yeah…?” Shigaraki maintained eye contact as he continued on, his gaze patient as if explaining something complex and terrible to a child for the first time, “Do you remember what everyone was doing to rescue him? There were three pro heroes, a whole crowd of onlookers, and yet nobody did anything… Why’s that?” The boy frowned, thinking back to the incident and cross-referencing it with his rescue training as he muttered, “Well, they weren’t doing  nothing ; the pros were focused on keeping the fire under control and making sure the crowd stayed safely back as they waited for more suitable backup to arrive. For the quirks and skillsets they had, it was the strategically sound thing to do.” And yet… “And yet,” Shigaraki said, as if voicing his thoughts aloud, “It took  you  , a quirkless little middle-schooler, arguably the most unqualified person  possible  in that situation, running in to actually fucking  try  and do something for any of those so-called heroes to get their butts in gear.” Deku’s eyes widened, and he protested, “Th-that’s not true! All Might-” “ All Might  ,” Tomura hissed as though the name itself was poison, “wasn’t moved to action until it was  your  life in danger as well. He’d been hanging towards the back that whole time, wheezing like an old geezer off his life support, and he didn’t get off his ass to do his damn job until  you forced him to!” Izuku’s mouth clicked open and shut as he furiously scrabbled for some argument against the point Shigaraki was making, but found himself unable to counter without risking a fight. It was true that All Might had been running on empty by that point and had even said so himself later, but it hadn’t been his hero’s fault for being proactive. He had already saved many lives that day, Izuku’s own included, and the man just couldn’t be expected to be everywhere at once. The heroes on the scene had done the best they could with what they’d had; sooner or later, backup would have arrived. But then… was that time that a suffocating Kacchan would have had? What would have happened if Izuku  hadn’t  run out when he did, or if All Might had never shown up? Sensing the boy’s resolve falter like a shark scenting blood on the water, the man earnestly continued in a firm but quiet tone, “This is exactly what I’ve been trying to tell you, Izuku. I wanted to be a hero myself you know, once upon a time, but let me be the first to tell you: you’re not saving others at  all  with that career path, even if you do wind up saving some lives. You’re teaching people  complacency  , you’re teaching them noncompliance, laziness,  apathy  , you’re teaching the average citizen to turn and walk away when something terrible happens instead of taking any meaningful action because ‘oh of course, it’ll be fine! A  hero  will come along! So long as All Might keeps smiling and someone stronger than the bad guys exists,  we  don’t have to do anything at  all  !’” Shigaraki’s voice took on a falsetto pitch as he mocked the fictional bystanders, his voice climbing in volume as he spoke. Deku winced and scooted away subtly, slowly taking all of this in as he let the man speak his piece. Shigaraki, of  all people, had wanted to be a hero once…? “They can witness a great tragedy and just continue on their merry way as if nothing had ever happened, and  that ,” He jabbed the air emphatically with his spoon, “that lazy, irresponsible attitude, is what’s rotting the world from the inside out.” His voice was so filled with purpose and vindication, a very stark contrast to the uncertain goon who’d menaced Izuku at the mall so long ago. The boy sat quietly through all this, uncomfortable and a little overwhelmed. Unwillingly, he found his thoughts drifting to all the teachers and adults who’d sat by and done nothing as Kacchan and his cohorts terrorized him... The man took a moment to recollect himself, then carried on evenly, “It’s the source of all the corruption in our society, Izuku, and it’s why we need to just purge everything. There’s too much rot for anything to be saved.” “That’s ridiculous. I can understand being frustrated at a broken system, but that’s no reason to destroy  everything, ” Deku shot back, incredulous at the ridiculous mission statement. Then, remembering his earlier point, countered, “...And regardless of everything you just said, it’s not always as simple and straightforward as that. They- those heroes, that time with Kacchan, they were just a bad matchup against the sludge villain, so they would’ve been taking a major risk-” Shigaraki cut him off mercilessly, furious but not at him. “You didn’t care when  you  ran in and took the risk that it was  their job  to take. You didn’t care because you saw the right thing to do, and you just… did it! Just like that! It’s why you’re so much better than all the rest of them, Izuku, you don’t hesitate or think selfishly when you see what needs to be done... Just like your dad.” His voice had shifted into something softer that was warm with admiration, and the teen squirmed in his seat a little at the whiplash. “Well still, I-” Then the last part of that sentence hit him, and he cringed into a ball of revulsion as he began to yell, “I am  nothing like-!” His captor cut him off, looking apologetic. “No, no, that’s enough. I see I’ve made you upset, and I’m sorry for that. Your dad’s a topic for another day, when you’re less overwhelmed. Let’s just finish our meal in peace, yeah?” Izuku stuttered for a moment more, wanting to argue the point, before softly echoing, “Yeah, ok. Fine. Let’s eat.” He ducked his head to avoid the other’s gaze as he ate, and Shigaraki ruffled his hair fondly before beginning to eat again as well. He grit his teeth and reminded himself: winning this argument wouldn’t be worth losing all the ground he’d gained. Izuku thought over all that his potential cousin had said, unease riding high in him at how he could almost agree with certain parts of it. The bystander effect  was  a real and well-documented phenomenon, after all…  He wasn’t going over to the dark side, he  wasn’t…  they were just in agreement about certain problems present in society, that’s all. It didn’t mean he wanted to  burn it all down  and start again like this maniac wanted to… the heroic thing to do would be to fix it, piece by piece. The boy stewed on his swirling thoughts as they began eating in silence again, this time thick with contemplation. Was it really ok, to be agreeing with the supervillain this much though? Had he kept his morals intact, or… or, was he being successfully corrupted? How could he know? “Well, unfortunately,” The villain began as he gathered the dishes at the conclusion of their meal, “I don’t have any more time to hang out with you. I’ll be back later, so you be good ‘til then, alright?” Izuku nodded absently, not even meeting the other’s gaze. He was still feeling spacey and deep in thought from the earlier conversation. “Sure, ok.” He blinked out of his reverie as Shigaraki ruffled his hair playfully again, before exiting the cell and whistling cheerfully as he made his way down the hall. Izuku didn’t recognize the tune, but to him it sounded… somehow optimistic. Disturbingly so. 
 Izuku remained in a nervous, unsettled bubble of his own until lunch rolled around. His new visitors introduced themselves as Spinner and Mr. Compress, and the young hero recognized them both from the summer camp raid. Mr. Compress especially… Still, he was trying to appear as compliant unsuspicious as possible for the moment, so when they offered him a few rounds of poker to decide who got the lion's share of the sweets, he agreed to join in. “So… you were chosen as worthy and spared by Stain himself?” Spinner asked with some interest, laying down a four of spades. “Y-yeah,” the boy replied, “he said something to that effect.” Honestly, he could barely remember; it felt so long ago and far away now he had almost entirely forgotten. That had been his first real fight holding some proper control over One For All… “What was he like? Did he give you any parting wisdom?” The lizard man asked eagerly, leaning towards him. “Not really, no. He mostly just kept stabbing me to keep me down and attempting to murder my friends. And he was very… opinionated. I fold, by the way,” Izuku replied awkwardly as he repressed a wince at the card he’d just drawn, somewhat confused by the mild disappointment on Spinner’s face. What did this guy care what Stain had thought of him? It’s not like they would let him practice as a hero again if they had the chance, and as far as he could remember Shigaraki hated Stain anyways. “I see.” The villain muttered, drawing a card and poorly repressing a grin. “All in.” “Checkmate, once again!” Mr. Compress sang, throwing down his cards to reveal a perfect hand. “Augh, there’s no way you got a royal flush twice in a row! You’ve been using your quirk to cheat this whole time, you lying bastard!” Spinner cried as he brought a fist down on a nearby book pile, furious. Compress simply wagged a finger in the other’s face and reached greedily for Spinner’s now forfeit serving of dango, chuckling, “Oho, but deception is part of the game, is it not my dear Spinner? A victory is a victory, and to the victor goes the spoils!” 
 That evening, Izuku was reclining on his cot, taking a break to read one of the more interesting novels when a strange noise met his ears. The soft whir of mechanical components moving in tandem, interspersed with rhythmic footsteps… a set of robotic legs? A strange man had come to deliver his meal, though he had only stayed long enough to introduce himself as Re-Destro and make some brief, polite small talk before rushing off to be someplace important. He had been dressed like a businessman and spoken like someone who knew how to run things, and Izuku worried about what it would mean if someone with as much money as a CEO was supporting the villains here. He was learning more and more about how the Paranormal Liberation Front operated the longer he stayed… would it really be wise to take his opportunity to escape now? The boy drifted to sleep with these troubled thoughts on his mind, a small furrow ruffling his brow. That night, Izuku slept restlessly again. He couldn’t remember his dreams when he woke, but he was certain it had involved more conflict between Nana Shimura and All For One. Somehow, the boy was glad he couldn’t remember. 
 In the morning, it was the doctor who came to visit him. “How are you doing? Do you have everything you need?” Dr. Ujiko asked, getting straight to the point after they’d sat down to eat. Izuku didn’t need to ask to know what the old man was talking about. “Yeah, I’m good. I have everything I could ever want, thank you.”  Seriously  , he tried to communicate desperately with his eyes, afraid to say too much aloud.  Thank you . “Oh, it’s nothing my dear boy. Anything for a former patient of mine!” The doctor was smiling, but there was a strange edge to it. Had someone else put him up to this, he wondered? “Have the uh, results come in?” Izuku asked, his voice hushed. “Afraid not,” Ujiko replied succinctly. Izuku’s heart sank; he may never really know for sure, then, unless he plucked up the courage to ask the officials for a similar test if-  once-  he got out. Assuming they could get ahold of Shigaraki’s DNA, of course, or even chose to believe him...  As the boy mulled this over, the doctor began gathering their dirtied cutlery and getting ready to go. “I would love to stay for a quick round of shogi, but I’m afraid I have much to tend to. Goodbye, Izuku-kun, and good luck.” “Bye, thank you again!” The old man was gone before he could even finish getting his thanks out. 
 Lunch was dropped off by a strange man in a parka who didn’t even bother to introduce himself, much less stay and chat, so Izuku decided to take full advantage of this unexpected free time by pouring over the map as thoroughly as possible.  As the boy put the finishing touches on his potential escape plan a few hours later, he heard a familiar knock signifying that dinner had come. Ah, sounded like Shigaraki’s this time. He stashed the fruits of his labor quickly and carefully as always before calling, “Come in!” With a strange pang of melancholy, Deku realized this may be the last time he spoke to Shigaraki for a very long time. The villain may even hate him for trying to leave, and never give the thought of redemption a chance. This strange, almost brotherly bond they’d built up over the course of his captivity would probably be destroyed, as well. Would running really be worth that? As the man sat down and handed him a plate, the young hero was struck by a sudden urge to know him better and decided there wasn’t any harm in asking about his past if he decided to be gone by the next morning, anyways. Sensitive topic or no, this might be his final chance to do so. “You look troubled,” the man smacked between slurps of his ramen, “What’s up?” Well, it was now or never. “You wanted to be a hero once before, you said?” Izuku probed cautiously, trying his best to look innocent. Shigaraki gave him a hard stare, but before Izuku could worry that he’d gone too far replied, “Yeah… but seeing as my dad  really  didn’t approve, that wasn’t exactly going to happen anyways. Especially with how my powers…  manifested .” The boy winced but carried on with a curious blink, “Right, yeah… Uh, but can I ask, why didn’t your dad approve? Was he a villain or something?” The man snorted harshly. “Oh, he was a bastard and a piece of shit, but he wasn’t any kind of career criminal like I am now. He didn’t like heroes because our grandmother  gave him up  to pursue her career, like the selfish woman she was. You know how low adoption rates are for kids who still have living parents here in Japan?” Izuku frowned thoughtfully at the floor at this. Would a previous user of One For All really do such a thing? Or was this just another lie he was told by All For One? Izuku murmured, “I see… so, nobody in your family approved of your dream, then?” “No, that’s- my sister, my mom, and my grandparents on her side, they all supported me. It’s just that, when I tried to talk about it around  him  he would get-get  violent  and…” the man trailed off with an uncomfortable shrug and turned away from Izuku to shovel noodles into his mouth in lieu of finishing the statement. “You didn’t deserve that. You were just a child!” Izuku whispered, outraged. “Yeah, well. What’s done is done.” Tomura muttered bitterly into his chopsticks. Once again, Deku was struck by just how  lucky  he was, to have had a mother like his own and All Might as a mentor to support him, so many wonderful friends and teachers. He’d been given so much to have gotten to where he was now... After a slightly sour pause passed between them, Izuku asked gently, “... Is this what they would’ve wanted for you, Shigaraki? Your mom and your sister?” The villain blinked slowly and let his chopsticks rest in his lap for a long, contemplative moment, as if he’d never considered that before. Finally, he breathed, “...No, but that doesn’t matter anymore. What matters is what I have now and what I’m moving towards in the future. And, with you by my side, the future looks very bright.” He turned to the boy with a genuine smile and said, “I may have lost my old family and Sensei for now, but I still have you, at least. Regardless of everything, I really do think of you as a little brother.” And he could be trying to leave tomorrow, disappearing forever from this life just as his old family had done. Deku’s stomach twisted into painful, guilty knots, and the boy did his best to not let that show on his face as he leaned into the warm hand that patted his shoulder. After a few more mouthfuls had passed, he asked, “What was your name before, if All For One really adopted you fully?” The other gave a soft smile and replied, “Tenko. Tenko Shimura.” “That’s a nice name. Kind of a shame he took it from you, though.” Deku muttered into the stragglers of what was left of his meal as he scooped the final few chunks into his mouth. A deep sigh emanated from Tomura as he replied, “No, it’s really not, but maybe you’ll understand that someday in the future.” A contemplative silence descended on the pair as they finished their dinner and went about cleaning up what remained. “Now, let’s get you a shower. You reek!” 
 Their meditative lack of conversation continued to and from the trip to the showers, and it was Shigaraki who finally broke the silence once they returned. “So, I’m going to be, ah,  occupied  all day tomorrow and maybe even the day after, so I may not be able to visit you for a while. Here’s a treat so you won’t miss me  too  much while I'm gone,” So saying, the man materialized a candied apple using a familiar summoning quirk and tossed it to him. “Think fast!” Izuku nearly fumbled, but managed to neatly catch the treat that had been thrown at him. “Ah, you’ve been practicing!” He chirped with false cheer as a sudden chill shot down his spine; that had been the quirk All For One had used at Kamino to teleport Kacchan to him. Meaning, if he didn’t take his chance to run  now , then... A hand landed on his head and ruffled it harder than usual as Shigaraki chuckled, “Haha yeah, that’s a cool one, isn’t it? Maybe I’ll trade you it sometime.” He didn’t need to say what Izuku would be giving up in exchange. He gulped. He then brought the boy into an awkward one-armed hug, that Deku was surprised to find himself returning. “I’ll see you later then, yeah?” The boy said. Shigaraki beamed at his cooperation and pulled him fully into a rib-creaking bear hug. “Yeah, brat. I’ll see you later!” He then set the wheezing boy down and headed for the door. “Oh, and Shigaraki?” The man paused and looked back questioningly. Izuku smiled, for real this time. “Thanks for the apple!” The villain grinned back, “No problem, zucchini. Make sure to enjoy it.” and then, he was gone. As twilight filtered through his tiny window and the hour of his final decision approached, Izuku considered the candied apple that was so much like the first meal he’d been offered upon arriving here. All the things that his captors had spoken about and put him through, everything he had to do and everything he was risking. Eri loved these kinds of apples, too... It was true that he had grown strangely attached to these criminals in the course of pretending to settle in to keep up appearances, but no matter what, he just couldn’t risk letting his dream die here by staying any longer. He wouldn’t trade his compassion away for their villainous ways, not in a million years! But… if he stayed for too long, then he may well and truly lose his shot at heroism, and he had no way of knowing when the next opening to leave would be. Weeks, months... years . And Shigaraki… he couldn’t help but wonder what kind of procedure he was going to undergo. He hadn’t  seemed  unwell these past few days… It hurt to abandon what could be the only extended family he had like this, but he swore, he  swore  he would find a way to reach him from the outside, no matter how long it took. Cousin or no, he had gathered enough intel.  It was time to go home.

    Chapter Text
    Izuku’s heart pounded as he did a final check on all his supplies, the chorus of evening frogs and crickets outside barely audible over the dull roar of adrenaline in his ears. It was finally happening… he was finally making a break for it. The boy did his best to breathe evenly as he secured the wedge against his wrist and tried not to let his nerves get to him; the kind of anticipation he was feeling now made the second round of the Sports Festival feel about as nerve-wracking as a trip to the dentist. The boy hopped from foot to foot and flitted around his cell nervously, quadruple-checking his room for anything that could be left behind. With some careful rips and clever knotting, Izuku had crafted a small makeshift pack for himself, perfect for the set of supplies he’d decided to bring. He’d packed his notebook, his clock, as well as the tome that he’d recorded his more vital notes in; he was of course bringing his food sack and water cup as well, which he’d modified with a cannibalized book cover to create a makeshift canteen. Oh, it would have been dangerously noticeable, but maybe he could’ve made some sort of water filter between visits as well…? No, no… it was too late for that now. The map had come with a schedule of the guard rotations, and if he didn’t go now, he would have to wait another two hours before a good enough window of opportunity opened again. That was time he couldn’t afford to waste; every second he had to spare getting away from here was immeasurably precious. As the young hero finally hefted his makeshift knapsack and braced himself to open his prison cell door, one final thought occurred to him. Deku’s hand hovered in the air above the card reader, a clashing swirl of emotions filling him at the notion. Should he leave a note? Izuku frowned as he considered it; these people were villains. They had kept him here against his will, and even if he’d formed a strangely affectionate bond with some of them, it wasn’t exactly under the healthiest of circumstances. Even still, if he could retain just a  little bit of the trust he’d built up with them these past few weeks, it would probably help him pull Shigaraki out of his villainous ways further on down the road. He wasn’t so sure he could save the rest of the criminals directly, but if he could pull their leader out of the darkness, then some may be loyal enough to follow him to redemption. The green-haired teen debated with himself for a moment more, before finally caving and tearing a blank page from his notebook. Deku found himself struggling to find the words, however, and after feeling a few precious minutes slip through his fingers he finally scrapped the page entirely and began to scrawl anew with something brief but sincere. Perhaps, simple was best. A few moments later, it was done. Finally,  finally he was ready to go. Izuku squeezed the straps of his little rucksack anxiously and clutched the keycard in a quiveringly tight grip. The young man exhaled a tense breath as he braced himself to swipe, urging his mind to stay clear and calm. There was no going back after this; he was either going to escape, or lose his golden ticket home and wind up trapped here under tighter security than ever. The boy held his breath, steadying the hand poised above the card reader. Then, in one swift downwards motion, he swiped it down. It beeped a negative red. For two and a half seconds, Izuku’s heart stopped and frozen panic flooded his being. Then, he realized belatedly that he’d been holding the card the wrong way. “Oh, my god.” With an annoyed sigh at himself, he flipped it around and ran it through again,  correctly this time. The small light blinked green, and the lock clicked. The boy pushed the door open and hesitantly took his first free steps in almost a month.  Alright. Okay. Here we go…  He forced himself to keep his breathing even.  Stay calm, don’t lose your head. He just needed to head to the exit with the path he’d determined to be safest. If he could get out the gate without raising the alarm, he would probably be past the worst of it. Outside the facility, it would just be a race against time to get far enough away before his absence was noticed. But, he couldn’t rush yet. He couldn’t run, no matter how badly he wanted to. One foot in front of the other, slowly.  Slow and steady,  the teen mantra’d to himself as he walked.  Slow and steady…  Izuku picked his way painstakingly through the base for what felt like an eternity. Once, he spotted a pajama-clad Toga just as she disappeared down the opposite hall with a midnight snack in hand. Only a few turns later, he caught the sound of several sets of footsteps approaching, but managed to duck inside a blessedly unlocked doorway just in time. The further he went, the more certain he was that he’d be caught at any moment, that this was some kind of sick test of “loyalty” that the villains had cooked up for him, that he was making a huge mistake and should have just bided his time until a rescue team appeared. But then, when he pushed open one last door and found himself breathing in the crisp, near-forgotten taste of fresh air for the first time since his capture, he couldn’t help but feel it would be worth it anyways. The hero student navigated carefully across the grounds, hugging the walls and darting into cover at every chance he got. Finally, he spotted the outer wall just a few buildings away and began to follow it around to where he knew the gate out would be, heart thundering all the while. Holy crap, he might actually do this… he was so close! He turned one more corner, and… There. There it was. 
   The entrance gate. 
 It was being guarded by a set of drowsy-looking crooks who looked to be about ready to wrap up their shifts. He was just in time, then; even better, the huge sheets of metal which made up the doors were hanging slightly ajar, as if waiting for him. He was so close now, all Izuku had to do was slip by just as the guards made their switch, and he would be out… The boy clenched his fists as he wiped the beginnings of budding moisture from his eyes. He needed to focus; his tears could wait until he was safely home and back with his loved ones. His heart ached with longing at the thought, and a grim little smile graced his face.  Just a little longer until I can see everyone again. Mom, All Might, Kacchan, everyone... I   will make it.   With bated breath, he watched from the shadows a few buildings away as the minutes ticked by, and his heart leapt when a new shift came by to relieve the guards, just as the schedule on his map had said. No, actually… he checked his clock, and grinned with delight; the new shift was actually early!  They were all talking amongst themselves as they waited for their cohorts to clock out, not paying the gate any attention. Now, now was his chance! Pulse tight in his throat, the young hero made a break for it, clinging to the shadows of the building to his left. He walked briskly forward as casually and inconspicuously as he could so as to blend out in the open, closer and closer, he just had to make it past these last two buildings, now across this last stretch of open road and he would be free-!  Then, from around the final corner, a colossal form appeared. It was thrice his height and looked as though it had been hewn straight from a mountain. And it was staring straight at him. Izuku froze, suddenly as still as if he’d been made from stone himself. He knew this behemoth; he had been the one to bring the rest of the league to Shigaraki’s side when he’d been captured, the one to seal his fate. With mounting horror, he saw suspicion grow across the creature’s face. He needed to do something,  quick!  There was no way he could take this guy down and still get away, and if he maneuvered around the giant to bolt for the exit then the other would have more than enough time to raise the alarm and cut him off before he got very far. Then, all that was left was... Oh, boy. Deku waved cheerily and chirped, “H-hiya, big guy~!” Internally, he was wincing at the fumble in his greeting, but the creature-no,  Gigantomachia’s  shoulders drooped a little as his brow crumpled in confusion. “...Uh...?” “It’s me, Toga!” Izuku cheerfully and dishonestly clarified, bouncing in place and hoping wildly to every deity in existence that he was accurate to the girl’s mannerisms, “I was just on my way out for a midnight stroll! You mind if I squeeze past ya?” He felt sweat bead at his forehead; was he being too hasty here, trying to rush past? Would it be better to risk some small talk, or was he safer in having less time to give himself away? What would he do if the guards finished chatting to take their jobs seriously and close the gate before he could get out? The giant loomed over him in the darkness like a cryptid, before slowly lumbering closer, huffing and narrowing his eyes mistrustfully. “Why would you be using your quirk right now? You don’t  smell like bun-girl… what if you are actually the little prisoner trying to escape?” The boy batted his lashes and twirled a lock of hair between his fingers as he’d seen the other teen do frequently, hoping he looked cutesy and effeminate instead of tense as a steel bear trap. With a nervous giggle, he answered, “Oh, this? I like to turn into people I like just for fun, sometimes. Izu-kun is  really  cute, so I just, uh,  borrowed a blood sample from the doctor so I can see what his form feels like.” Thankfully, he didn’t have to fake the blush that typically spread across Toga’s face when talking about him with such embarrassing words coming out of his mouth. Izuku swallowed and fidgeted nervously with the front of his shirt as he built on the lie further, “It’s… It’s actually why I wanted to go into the woods in the first place, so I don’t get caught. I didn’t exactly ask for permission, see... Please, you won’t rat me out, will you? I’ll be in big trouble if they catch me, I was just  so curious~!” Izuku clasped his hands under his chin and put on his best pouty face and puppy eyes, lethal weapons he hadn’t pulled out since he was a small child begging his mother for yet another All Might action figure. The titan stared blankly down at him for a long, tense moment as Izuku barely dared to breathe, before rumbling, “You should just ask, next time.” Just as the tension was leaving the boy’s frame, he then asked sharply, “Except, why the food, then...?” His nostrils were flaring, and Izuku realized he could smell his rations. Deku ducked his head and chuckled quietly to hide his widening eyes and expression of panic, giggling for a moment too long as he bought time for himself to think this one out. “W-Why, because I wanted to make a picnic out of this trip, of course~! I, um, used some spare materials to make this bag myself, actually. Do you like it?” He was babbling, he shouldn’t have brought any attention to his obviously improvised rucksack, he needed to shut up before he ruined this-! “U-uh, yeah, it looks nice. Good job,” The giant stuttered with a surprised blink. There was a strange glint in his eye, and it took the boy a moment to realize it was pity; the other was clearly lying to be polite. Deku nodded and faked a pleased grin as he pushed down the bizarre pang of offense at the implication that his bag made from cannibalized pillows wasn’t fashionable. “Do girls like that? Handmade bags?” Gigantomachia suddenly whispered as he bent towards the imposter, rapt and attentive. “Yes! Of course! We all like bags.” Izuku blurted out in befuddlement, truly having not even the faintest idea. A dreamy look overtook the giant’s face, and he murmured something that sounded like, “Maybe I should try that…” to himself. “Well,” the boy said, finally seeing a chance to duck out of the conversation, “I should get going before it gets too late.” “Yeah,” Gigantomachia replied as he squatted down to be nearly on Izuku’s level, “You probably should. You’re going to that nice little meadow with the mossy benches and the little brook running through it, right?” “Right.” Izuku chirped with a smile that he hoped wasn’t too strained. “I’ll see you later then.” The colossus nodded, then curled up almost completely and craned his head downwards so his face was level with the runaway hostage’s. Izuku blinked and stared blankly at him, then the giant tilted his head to the side and offered him his cheek expectantly. Oh. Flustered, Izuku laid a hand on one of his massive fangs and pressed a quick peck to Gigantomachia’s cheek. The giant let out a pleased hum, before standing fully and pulling away.  Deku’s face flushed with embarrassment as he turned his face away so the giant hopefully wouldn’t see it. Thankfully, the giant had already stood back to his full height, and actually gave a little “all clear!” wave up to the guards above the door. They nodded in response and obligingly opened the gate wider for him.  “Thanks,” Izuku said, meaning it. Gigantomachia gave him a soft smile and gently replied, “Of course. Goodnight, Bun-girl.” “Goodnight, Gigantomachia.”  Just like that, Izuku continued forward and headed for the gate as one of the most powerful forces in the villain’s arsenal lumbered off into the night. Breathless with disbelief and dumbfounded at his luck, he felt his pace increase as he walked briskly to the gate. Walk, don't run. Walk, don’t run. Walk, don’t-. He was out. The military-grade steel gates passed him on either side as he strode briskly but casually out of the base, and for what felt like the first time in years the world opened up to him, wide and endless. A giddy lightness filled him as he deeply breathed in the fresh forest air, and when he was finally out of sight of the base he turned off the path and started to jog into the dark underbrush, unable to hold in the bubble of giddy laughter rising in his chest any longer. He couldn’t believe it, he had made it! He was out!  Izuku hiccuped and wiped his eyes as he slowed to a walking pace safely out of sight of the road, small deliriously joyful chuckles still escaping him as he started to collect himself. Right, this was going wonderfully so far, better than he ever could have hoped, but he still wasn’t out of the woods yet. Literally. Currently, it was already fully dark out, and he hadn’t had the luxury of running across a flashlight on his way out. The lights from the military complex-turned villain hideout were already fading, and unless he stayed within sight of the road he would likely become hopelessly lost. He could climb a tree to see if he could spot signs of civilization, but then he could just as easily be noticed by a perceptive enough villain patrol as well… Izuku looked up to the dazzling night sky as he muttered to himself, twinkling with more stars than he could ever hope to count. For a moment, his breath was taken away by their beauty, before he frowned as he realized what it meant; he must be very far from any big settlements, if there was almost no light pollution obscuring the night sky. He blinked as a powerline cut the star-splashed sky in two and stopped walking for a moment, following it with his eyes. The cable led from the pole it was attached to off to the villain base, and down along the road the other way. A hopeful smile lit his face; if he could just follow the power line back, he would surely reach the source, and by extension other people, eventually! What little survival training they’d had always recommended against traveling at night, but there was nothing for it; he had to put some distance between himself and his kidnappers as quickly as possible. Deku would just have to move carefully until sunrise, then he could travel at as quick a pace he wanted. Izuku nodded to himself, squeezed the straps of his pack eagerly, and began picking his way carefully through the shrubbery. -------- Toga yawned and stretched lazily, gazing up at the rosy pink predawn sky and relishing the sleepy quiet of her morning walk. She normally wasn’t up at the crack of dawn like this, but she had so been looking forward to visiting her adorable Izu-kun again, that she had decided to just go straight to sleep after her midnight pantry raid. This would be the second time she’s done this; her last visit had been so much fun, she couldn’t wait to surprise him again! Himiko was so glad they’d grabbed Izuku. Spending time with him had been helping her greatly with getting over her dear friend’s death. In fact, she was already feeling comfortable enough to speak with him in detail about Jin and the special bond they’d shared. Maybe right after this walk, she would go bring her little jailbird a nice breakfast surprise so the tragic subject she wanted to bring up wouldn’t completely kill her pleasant mood. Maybe some fruit, this time... She was sure he wouldn’t mind waking up a little early to spend some time with her! Toga giggled and hurried on with a skip in her step. Just before she reached the main compound where the kitchens were located, she spotted one of her taller friends having an outdoor breakfast not far from her. It was Gigantomachia! “Good morning!” She chirped, skipping up to him and swiping one of the many apples he was munching on. “How was your patrol?” “Good morning. Was okay.” He rumbled in return. Then he asked, “How was your picnic last night?” The girl paused mid-chomp, giving him a confused look. “Uh, what picnic?” “The one you took real late last night, while transformed to look like the prisoner.” Toga choked as she dropped her stolen apple, breakfast forgotten. ————— Izuku finally crested the steep hill he’d been climbing, pausing to lean against a tree and reward himself with another sip of water and a long, appreciative glance at the view. A vast, green valley spread out below him, blanketed with a lush array of trees that looked almost cushion-like from up here. A sky blue ribbon of river and lake cut through it at the bottom, and a small aging dam sat nestled between the lake and the river. Izuku’s smile slowly dropped from his face as he realized what was missing: there were no signs of civilization beyond the tiny dam. The power lines he had been following throughout the night lead straight down to it, and it was the only structure around. That meant it was probably an independent hydroelectric station that was supplying the base with power; a smart move, on Shigaraki’s part, since it let him stay off the grid, but terrible for anyone looking to track the villains. Or escape them. Izuku shaded his eyes and squinted out as far as he could see, searching nervously for any little clumps of buildings or signs of people, but came up with nothing. There was nobody else for as far as his eyes could see. The boy swallowed around the lump forming in his throat; just how far out had they taken him?! Deku’s gaze returned to the body of water far below him as he slid down the trunk to rest by the roots, pulling a snack out of his pack as he thought. Well… he had a few options to consider here. He could follow the river upstream and to his left, going around the edge of the lake; settlements tended to stay close to bodies of freshwater like this, so if he was lucky Izuku would eventually encounter a town or city of some sort before any pursuers could catch up to him. That side of the river seemed to hook back towards where the villain hideout was as it ran further upstream, however, so this option was less than ideal. Deku could follow the river downstream, where it led away from the base; he was far more likely to find other people who would help him this way than if he went upstream. However, from what he could see from where he was sitting now, the river ran for quite a while off into the distance. Even if he pushed himself hard, Izuku doubted he would get any further than the nature-blanketed horizon by nightfall.  By that time, his absence would have definitely been noted, assuming he wasn’t unlucky enough for that to already be the case, and he would easily be tracked as they followed this most obvious path home. He would then have to deal with his pursuers alone deep in the woods, outmanned, outgunned, presumably low on food and water, and exhausted from trekking. Even as his best chance for finding others and getting home, this path was a very risky endeavor all on its own. He could wander into the woods, leaving the rivers outright and hoping he ran into a town along the way, but this option was probably the riskiest of all. It gave him the best chance to lose his pursuers, sure, but… he wasn’t exactly outfitted for an extended camping trip in the sprawling wilds of Japan. He barely had enough food for a few days, if he stretched it, he had no gear to start a fire or build a shelter. He couldn’t even do much of anything about clean water once his canteen ran out! No, this was unacceptable as well. But then… there was the dam. The green-haired boy’s eyes wandered to the offending building thoughtfully. If he went to the dam instead of ignoring it to follow the river, then Izuku would very possibly be spotted… but, there was a unique opportunity here as well. This plan was risky,  very risky, but if he could sneak in, disable the dam without getting caught, and get out without being spotted, then he could create a serious diversion as the villains scrambled to fix their power source. Hopefully, the ensuing chaos would provide enough of a distraction for him to escape downstream and reach a settlement in time. If he was destructive enough, he might cripple the villains for weeks, possibly even months as they repaired the damage or relocated to another base. That would help him immensely in the event that he was caught and in need of a second escape!  Yes, this could work. This was the right plan to take! He stretched his already somewhat sore muscles and gave his face a few firm slaps to wake himself up. This might be his last real obstacle… it was time to escape, once and for all! ----------- Tomura groaned as he slowly swam back to consciousness, feeling groggy and sick. He had been woken by something loud and grating that he couldn’t quite make out yet. What was...? “-didn’t know to tell us until now, and-and now, we’re checking  everywhere- ” He blinked his crusty eyes open slowly, and gradually realized that someone was in his room, speaking to him as if he was coherent enough to understand them or respond.  Several someones, actually. He finally managed to creak an eye open and immediately snapped it shut with a mild wince at the bright lights of the infirmary that greeted him. Clearly, the anesthetic had yet to fully wear off; whatever his henchmen were waking him for, it had better be damn important. The base had better be on fire, or swarming with heroes intent on killing him again. Or both. With another louder, more irritated groan the man sat up, scrubbing the sand from his eyes and forcing himself to focus. “Wait, stop, start over. I didn’t get any of that. What’s happened?” Shigaraki opened his eyes again, slowly this time, and was greeted by the sight of a blubbering Toga and extremely irate Dabi. A cold lump settled in his stomach. Somehow, just by the look on their faces, he knew. Cold fury gripped Shigaraki like a vice. His hands clenched the sheets in a white-knuckled grip, and a deadly stillness settled over him. He sat up straight and calmly addressed his underlings, “...He’s out, isn’t he?” ------ It was midmorning by the time Izuku arrived at the hydroelectricity plant. The facility that had seemed so tiny up on the knoll was intimidatingly huge this close up. There were a few villains milling about along the crest, but not as many as he’d expected to be standing guard; the rest must be inside. That, or they were running on a skeleton crew, if he was lucky. From here, he could see a small control tower rising above the opposite end of the dam; it was probably where the hardware for controlling the gates was housed. Even better, it had windows on all sides; perfect for a quick getaway into the woods far below, provided he was careful about the fall. Still, Izuku couldn’t afford to underestimate his target here. He had to pull this off. Even if Shigaraki may forgive him for destroying their power supply on the grounds of their supposed “family relations”, his cronies certainly would not. If one was feeling particularly mutinous, or if a new associate decided to take matters into their own hands... It was do or die, now. He breathed in slowly to steady himself, held it in, and took the plunge. Deku leaped from the cover of the underbrush and darted up the stairs to the entrance of the facility, hopping the vine-strangled fence along the way. Blessedly, the backdoor was unlocked, and Izuku quietly slipped inside. The boy padded carefully around as he searched for the stairs up to the edge of the main wall, peeking around corners and straining to hear any approaching footsteps over the deafening roar of the rushing waters. He finally found what he was looking for after a few close calls with some goons patrolling the halls, and his heart lightened considerably as he stepped out to see he was up on the crest, the reservoir to his left, and the river far below to his right. There were no villains in sight up here, at the moment. This area was dangerously open regardless, but if he was quick he might just make it across without being spotted. From there, he would be a simple One For All-powered hop, skip, and jump away from reaching his target, and then he could escape the dam unnoticed and be on his merry way home within the next fifteen minutes or so. Deku had barely taken a few steps forward when the aging intercoms blared to life and froze him in his tracks. “Hello,  Izuku. We know you’re there at our hydroelectric plant, just wanted to let you know this was a stupid plan and we’re already on our way to pick you up. Hope you enjoyed your little ‘picnic’ while it lasted,  brat .” Shigaraki’s tranquilly furious voice spat bitterly from the rusted speakers above him.  He didn’t think. Izuku blindly bolted out into the open and across the walkway, desperate to reach the control tower and smash it to pieces before his pursuers arrived. He didn’t have much time, but if he could just get close enough for a powered-up leap to- He didn’t even make it halfway across. The entire dam shook with the force that Shigaraki and the cohorts he was carrying slammed into it, a great plume of dust blossoming up upon impact right where he’d just been standing mere moments before. Izuku spun and lost his footing, stumbling as he scrambled back and away just in time to dodge a swipe from Shigaraki. Thinking quickly, he aimed a kick towards the villain’s outstretched hand and sent him skidding back with a low snarl. The boy tried to retreat to the doorway behind him for cover, but Spinner emerged from the dust to flip over him and blocked his path. Izuku skidded to a stop and whirled to face Shigaraki again at the high whistle of an oncoming attack, throwing a blast of air pressure behind himself and hoping it stopped Spinner from getting too close. He whacked away the incoming black tendrils with a sharp crack of his own, only for Spinner to leap over his suppressing fire and onto his back in an attempt to shove a huge, unfamiliar scimitar to his throat. Izuku gritted his teeth past a surprised hiss as he did his best to keep the curved blade away from his throat, staggering slightly at the sudden weight. Dabi lunged through the dust cloud straight at him, and Izuku shot a hand back over his shoulder to rip Spinner from his back and slam him into his flame-wielding comrade before he could get too close. Sharp, sudden pain tore a shout from Deku’s throat, and he turned to find a tearfully furious Toga had flanked him to sink a knife deep into his thigh. “How could you? We were really  building  something together, now you’ve gone and ruined it!” She cried, and Izuku hesitated at the genuine pain in her eyes and voice for just a split second, half a split second too long. He kicked her away with the dagger still stuck in him and left himself open and off-balance as the smaller form of the giant he’d met earlier barreled into him and held the boy to the ground. “You lied, Little Prisoner tricked me!!” The giant roared, sounding both furious and mortified. The clacking of hurried dress shoes against concrete followed, and Izuku heard Shigaraki bark out, “Compress, marble him while he’s down!” Ice-cold terror warred with the white-hot fury shooting through Deku’s veins; he wasn’t going to be caught so easily, not this time! Pushing the limits of how much of his quirk he could safely use, the hero-in-training slammed both feet into Gigantomachia’s abdomen with enough force to make his shin bones creak dangerously, sending the stony behemoth sailing off of him and into the lake below. A great spray of water shot up and showered everyone at the splash that followed, going collectively ignored as Izuku rolled to dodge a blast of heat from Dabi and leapt into the air to avoid a swipe from Spinner’s massive new sword. Now it was Compress flying towards him, and with a pained groan Izuku quickly wrenched the dagger from his thigh and hurled it at the villain, narrowly avoiding being marbled as the man captured the dagger instead. Compress clicked his tongue in annoyance, and a spray of blood promptly left his mouth as he bit his tongue when Izuku’s kick connected hard enough to send the dapper criminal flying back. As gravity dragged him down towards the villains again, the boy scanned the battlefield frantically. Where, where was-? “No more games. You’re coming back home with us, Izuku.  Now .” Behind him…! Before the young hero could react, Shigaraki’s steel-strong arms were around him, and he was being yanked high, high into the air. “N-no!” Izuku cried, struggling and thrashing frantically against the other’s grip, his arms trapped against his sides in a bear hug. He tried to free himself using One For All, but found it to be absent. The wedge, it must have slipped! However, when he brought his wrist up to his face to adjust it, the boy found that it was still perfectly in place. The light still flashed red, indicating that it wasn’t operational. But then, how…? Deku craned his head upwards, meeting Shigaraki’s furious, unnaturally bright red gaze glaring right back down at him. He knew that glow. Izuku’s stomach plummeted in abject horror.  Erasure. Shigaraki has   Erasure. 
   But then, that would mean he…he..! 
 “Y-you! You  took-  !” The boy choked out, barely able to speak over his grief and rage as well as the human vice crushing his back to Shigaraki’s chest. Was Aizawa-sensei even still alive? All this time, had he been bonding and spending time with his teacher’s murderer?  “Yeah, I took Eraserhead’s quirk. That means you’re not getting away from me again, so quit resisting!” Shigaraki snapped in his ear, squeezing him tighter still. His words only made Izuku struggle harder, unhinged fury twisting his face. Izuku curled forward into a tight ball, then brought his head back to crack against Shigaraki’s nose as hard as he could. Between being depowered and the villain’s monstrous regenerative abilities, Deku barely did enough damage to cause a momentary nosebleed. The force of the headbutt was enough to make the other grunt in surprise more than pain, and green curls flew into Shigaraki’s eyes and forced the villain to reflexively shut them, if only for a moment. A moment was all the captive teenager needed. Izuku tore out of Shigaraki’s hold and kicked off of him like a platform, using the man’s body to propel himself back down to the dam. The other’s shout of protest quickly receded, and the wind was deafening as it screamed past his ears and made his eyes water at the speed of his descent. He shot past the other villains on the deck instead of attacking them or going for the tower, and instead twisted in midair to face the curved reservoir wall now looming in front of him.  With so many pursuers and the added element of Erasure, the chase was effectively over; Shigaraki was right. There was no real hope of getting away now. Still, with what little time he had left with his freedom, Deku was determined to make a difference. If he could disrupt the villain’s operations even just for a little bit by taking out their source of power, then so be it. As a hero, Izuku had to try. He had gotten so far with this attempt, he couldn’t let it all be for nothing! The wild-eyed teen tightened his hand into a fist and brought it back, bracing himself for the agony of breaking himself at 100% again. The familiar power shrieked through him like a locomotive, and the boy slammed his fist into the solid concrete with all his strength. An underwhelming ‘thunk’ jolted uncomfortably up through his arm, and the dam remained serenely intact and unmoved. Nothing had happened. From above, an already-recovered Shigaraki was swooping down on him like a buzzard, his face stone-like and resolute. Izuku tried to buy himself more time by groping into his pack and hurling the first thing his fingers touched, the book holding his ciphered information, up at his assailant. The man simply caught and dusted it without batting an eye, and snatched him up once again. This time, he held the boy side-on so there would be no more headbutting. Izuku thrashed and screamed with despair and frustration, absolutely furious with himself for his failure. Just a moment more, and he could have done it! The atmosphere shifted. Suddenly a hand, Shigaraki’s good hand, clamped over his face with a bruising grip, and the teen felt an unfamiliar... pulling sensation, a sense of vertigo, as though gravity had somehow shifted towards the spidery appendage on his face. Shigaraki’s fingers hummed with a bizarre energy that left static-like tingles where they were pressed, and he felt somehow incredibly invaded. Everything went cold as Deku realized what he was feeling, what Shigaraki was doing, and felt himself going limp against his will. He dug his nails numbly into the arm crushing him sideways against the villain’s chest as he choked out, “Y-you… You promised you wouldn’t-” Just as suddenly, sheer wrath surged back in to replace the horror, and Deku felt his face twist into something ugly. “How dare you try to take it?!” “How dare I? How dare I?!” Shigaraki shrieked around a hysterical bark of laughter. “You’re trying to abandon us, abandon me, your family, so that you can run off to be with All Might again. And for what, just to save some complete strangers, and go back to being our enemy? Just to forget everything that’s happened here and go back to ruining our dreams?! How much more traitorous than that can you get? You’re just like her, just like Nana! Just like the one who made him treat me like that!” Shigaraki roared, sounding absolutely mad. There was a high, wild edge to his voice, something that made it sound like hysteria was more in control than Shigaraki was, and Izuku wheezed out a soft yelp of pain as the arm around his torso tightened to a painful degree. “Give it to me, give me One For All. I need it, I need it!” He couldn’t breathe, nails were digging into his forehead and cheeks hard enough to pierce the skin as his ribs creaked dangerously in Shigaraki’s hold. His blind rage was snuffed out by the numb realization that he may actually die here if Shigaraki didn’t regain control of himself, and he couldn’t move, couldn’t  breathe- “T-Tomura-!”  Shigaraki released him as suddenly as if he’d been burned, eyes wide with a disoriented horror. Izuku cried out as he suddenly found himself falling down, down, down, all the way to the base of the dam. This was just like the tryouts for UA, except he wouldn’t even have the chance to save himself because of Erasure but he had to  try, he had to right himself, aim downwards, and-! With a well-aimed punch at the ground, Izuku managed to miraculously get out a safe gust of air from One For All to break his fall. He tumbled to a messy stop among the pebbles of the shoreline, thankfully unhurt save a few scratches. Shigaraki touched down not far from him as the boy struggled to his feet, and the two stared frozen at each other for what felt like hours, tension buzzing in the air like a coiled snake ready to strike. Shigaraki’s face wasn’t cleared of whatever had possessed him earlier, and he seemed to be visibly warring with himself. The villain opened his mouth as if to say something before closing it again, looking away with an agonized glint in his eyes. “...Go, Izuku.” He choked out suddenly, as if forcing himself to speak. Izuku’s eyes widened with disbelief. “Wh-What?” The boy whispered, certain that he’d misheard somehow. Shigaraki shook his head drunkenly and stumbled away from the teenager, keeping his eyes firmly on the ground. “I’ve just realized how bad- I mean, I can’t really…” The villain trailed off with a sigh as a hand came up to clutch at his head, then tried again, “I’m sorry, but I don’t think… you’re safe here with us anymore. With  me  .” Shigaraki shifted, his posture tense as if he was holding himself back as he continued, “There’s something wrong with me. I suddenly… I just can’t control myself…” Concern flared in the boy’s chest, despite everything. Izuku made as if to reach out, but the man flinched away. Had he not meant to try and take-? The boy’s eyes widened. The surgery. “I’ll fix this one day,” The man who could be his cousin continued before Izuku could get any words out. “Until then…” Two steps closer. “Sh-Shigaraki, wait-“ “Give your mother my regards.” The villain’s hand shot out at him with the glow of an unfamiliar quirk nestled in his palm, and then everything went white. --------- Izuku wandered dazedly along the banks, following the river downstream. He couldn’t quite remember why he was doing this, where he was coming from, or where he was going, but somehow he knew it was important that he go this way. He was… going somewhere? Getting away from something? Why was he here? Where was everyone else…? The last thing he could remember was being told that he and his classmates were going to someplace called Jakku for some kind of mission. Had… had something gone wrong…? He’d thought Jakku General Hospital was around more city than forest, and he couldn’t access his GPS to check because his phone didn’t seem to be on him. Stranger still, there was an odd band on his wrist that he couldn’t seem to pry off on his own. Was this some kind of support gear that was relevant to the assignment? It didn’t seem to be doing anything, had he broken it...? Well, whatever misfortune had befallen him, he wasn’t out of the woods yet. Literally. Deku wasn’t entirely sure what had happened to him, but he was certain that it had been something bad; he had a stab wound in one thigh, and some strange cuts and bruises on his face. His ribs were bruised, his body ached in the same way it did when he overdid it with One For All, and the clothes he was wearing were unfamiliar, scruffy, and anonymous, nothing like the stuff he’d usually wear. He was carrying a pack that looked like it had been hastily made out of torn linens of some kind that held an assortment of different foods, none of which seemed suitable for a hike through the woods. Somehow, it felt too light, as though he’d forgotten something. Izuku tried to analyze the situation further, but found he was having a great deal of difficulty thinking straight. His mind was sluggish and hazy, and he distantly recognized that he must have been hit with some kind of disorientation or memory-wipe quirk. The boy wandered alongside the river for hours, until the sun had set, disappeared for the night, and risen again. He was exhausted, but knew he had to keep going; if he ran out of food or got caught in a bad enough storm out here, he wouldn’t have anyone or anything to depend on. And worse, he didn’t have the supplies to properly treat the wound in his leg; it seemed to have been patched up with a crude shred of cloth, but if it got infected and he became too sick to move, then his chances of survival would be slim to none.  Though, he couldn’t help but note that the makeshift bandage hadn’t come from him; his clothes were more or less intact, and it didn't match any of the materials from his homemade rucksack. Meaning that, most likely, someone else had to have patched him up. Why had they left him, then? Why was he out here all alone, hurt and amnestic? Finally, just as the unusual mix-mash of food in his strangely cobbled-together pack ran dry sometime in the late afternoon, Izuku came across a small settlement. By now, he was filthy, weak, exhausted, and very,  very thirsty. (He hadn’t dared to quench his thirst with the water from the stream; severe brain fog or no, he knew better than to drink from an unfiltered source, even one that appeared as clean as this one.) As he got into the town proper, Deku came across small gaggles of people. Delirious hope filled him; finally, he could get some help and figure out what was going on! This whole fiasco was almost over. Some of the townsfolk stopped and stared at him as he approached, though most scurried away before he could even get any words out, avoiding eye-contact and clutching their children close. “P-please… Please help! Please help me!” The young teen croaked out in a parched voice, hoarse and whispery from disuse and dehydration. “I’m hurt, can someone please call a hero or an ambulance for me? I need the authorities!” His weak, raspy voice wasn’t carrying very far, however, and with his appearance being what it was it took awhile for him to snag someone long enough to call in some first responders. Something tickled the back of his mind unpleasantly at this. Why did so many people ignore him and continue walking when he so clearly needed help? Izuku was rushed to the hospital shortly after soliciting the kind stranger for help, where he swiftly received the intensive medical attention he’d so desperately needed. Once he’d been patched up, given an IV drip to replenish his fluids, gotten the strange device on his wrist removed, and been given the all-clear for visitors a few hours later, a pair of detectives came in to interview him. They apologized for the inconvenience while he was clearly so exhausted, but asked if he’d be up to answering some questions anyways. As badly as he wanted to shoo them away and sink into sweet oblivion, Izuku consented; he needed to know what was going on and if everyone else was okay, and his best bet for that would be to work with the detectives. Some things were a little clearer, now that he was somewhat recovered; he had been stuck somewhere, stuck with someone else? With other people? He had been fed and cleaned and clothed, but he hadn’t wanted to be there at all. Try as he might, however, his memory was still mostly indecipherable. It wasn’t until one of the officers got a call and informed him that he was filed as a missing person, one Izuku Midoriya, that things began to come flooding back in chunks and pieces. He was at Jakku helping with evacuations when something terrible had happened, absolute destruction sweeping across the city. He had run into Shigaraki and been snatched up, dragged on board a helicopter and taken away. Waking up, days and days of an uncomfortably leisurely captivity as they tried to turn him to villainy, intense conversations, budding connections- Family. Shigaraki had insisted they were family. But, was it safe to tell the detectives that? Izuku knew it would probably be wisest to tell them everything, but what would the repercussions of such a dangerous implication mean? For himself? For his dream? For his mother?  They were interrupted by the sound of two sets of rapidly approaching footsteps, one heavy and one strikingly familiar, and for a moment adrenaline shot through the teen as he feared it was one of the villains, showing up to take him away again, or to wake him from what must be the wonderful dream he was having. Then, he heard a frantic voice pleading with his doctor, and every panicked, rabbity thought fluttering around his head evaporated into nothing. “Please, I know they’re not done, but I need to see my son-! ” His head shot up off the pillow he’d been resting against; he knew that voice. He’d just spent weeks fearing he’d never hear it again. “Mom…?” Izuku called hoarsely, voice small and childlike. One of the detectives exchanged a small, knowing smile with his partner and warmly said, “We’ll pick this back up sometime later, Midoriya-kun. It’s good to have you back,” He patted the teen’s knee and stood to leave just as his mother burst through the door, looking haggard and tearful and so,  so relieved. “Mom?! MOM!!” Izuku cried, seizing up at the sheer emotion flooding through him. “ Izuku!!  ” The woman wailed as she sprinted into the room; the injured boy tried to get out of bed to embrace his mother, but was too slow as she flung herself across the room to engulf him in the most crushing hug she’d ever given him. “Izuku! My baby, I was  so  w-worried!” She sobbed as she peppered his face with kisses and swiped at his eyes and her own, and Izuku belatedly realized he was crying just as hard as she was. “M-Mom it’s okay, I’m okay! I made it, I’m safe! I’m back, I’m back!  ” He babbled incoherently into the soft cotton-clad shoulder he was clutching at, hiccups and sobs of his own pouring out of their own accord all the while. In all honesty, he was reassuring himself as much as he was her; it was only just now hitting him that this was all real, that he’d escaped. Her familiar scent filled Izuku’s nose, and he buried his face into her pink cardigan like a small child. “They- they didn’t follow me! I made it out okay, don’t cry, Mom.” “Oh, Izuku,” She cooed shakily, overcome, “It’s me who should be telling you that! You’re safe, baby, you’re safe. I’m here now. I’m here...” His mother rocked him gently from side to side, and Izuku felt all the tension and anxiety and dread he’d been holding in these past few weeks melt out of him like snow on a warm day. He was out, he was safe, and his mother was holding him tightly in her arms. As the reality of her words hit him, what was left of his defenses finally crumbled and he allowed himself to slump bonelessly against her and weep. He’d actually done it, somehow.  Izuku Midoriya was  free . ---------- “What the hell was that?” Dabi muttered darkly after they’d landed at the base and begun their walk back to the main compound. Nothing explicit had been said, but from their unhurried pace, the order was clear: their little prisoner was being set loose, for seemingly no reason at all. “Yeah, Tomura-kun! What are you doing?! We need to go back for him! Izu-kun’s gonna get  away, at this rate!” Toga cried, still sniffling with tears that had gone from enraged to mournful. Their leader let out a long, exhausted-sounded sigh. “Inform the others that they are not to go after Deku. He’s free to go.” “But  why-?!”  Toga began to wail in protest, but couldn’t even get the rest of her question out before Tomura hurried away, wanting to be alone. Back in his room, the man collapsed onto his bed and held his head in his shaking hands, the awful memories of what had just happened, what he had almost just allowed to happen, running through his head again and again. 
   That little shit. 
  He had somehow chosen to sneak out while Shigaraki had been in surgery, his timing impeccable. Thankfully, the doctor’s protectiveness of his more hard-to-come-by equipment had worked in their favor, as the boy was just in range enough to give them a signal. Just barely. 
   He had been feeling...off, since he’d woken up, but had favored retrieving his precious baby brother over pondering his post-surgery haze. 
   This would prove to be a near-fatal mistake. 
  Not wasting any time, Shigaraki grabbed those he felt were most suitable within arm’s reach and bounded straight to the dam, making sure the little runaway knew exactly what he was in for over the radio just before they touched down.  
   The kid put up an admirable fight for how outnumbered he was, he really did. A part of Tomura thrilled at how quick and clever he was in such a tight situation, surely something he’d picked up from his father. If he hadn’t been so angry, he almost even could’ve called it fun! 
   Still, their little game of cat and mouse had to come to an end eventually. When the opening presented itself, Shigaraki hauled the boy high into the sky with the intent of giving him a brief but stern talking to before restraining the kid and bringing him back home. Perhaps if he still struggled, he’d even establish a punishment right there on the spot. 
  Aside from the maximum-security cell and a few weeks of isolation to make him receptive to their conversations again, of course. No more books, no more journal, certainly no more spare pillowcases… clearly, he had been too lenient too quickly. Those were all things Izuku should have had to earn,  just as he had.  
   Those would just be the beginning, of course; he had been planning on thinking of more when the kid was safely back with them where he belonged. 
   That...wasn’t what occurred, however.  
  As Shigaraki snatched Izuku up for the second time after his close call with destroying their sole source of power, that muted hunger that he’d worked so hard to repress and control these past two and a half weeks suddenly came roaring up out of him like an eruption. It was like a starved beast, and Izuku’s forcefully aborted attempt to destroy the dam had been the promise of a feast. Distantly, Tomura felt himself wrench at that quirk he’d wanted so badly, and felt the boy go frighteningly limp in return. 
   This wasn’t supposed to happen. These urges were supposed to go away after the surgery, not… not get 
  worse…! 
  Then Izuku had gone and had the gall to act betrayed, after everything that he’d just pulled, and Shigaraki’s building hysteria had jumped straight to pure fury. He lost himself again, and didn’t come back until the boy was writhing and choking out a plea for mercy in his arms. As he dropped Izuku through an ocean of horror, Tomura knew things may never be the same for them again after this. The trust he’d worked so hard to build with the boy would be permanently damaged, after an attack like that.  
   Tomura desperately wanted to apologize, to take back what he’d just done so they could go back to the way things were before, but realized with a rush of horror that a second wave of that overwhelming 
  need 
  was overtaking him. In that moment, he knew he had a decision to make, one that should have been as difficult as it was painful. 
   In the end, it hadn’t even been much of a choice at all. 
 --- Ultimately, his options had been to let Midoriya go, or walk on eggshells as he lived with the risk that he’d snap and accidentally kill him one day. Or worse. He couldn’t risk killing his family by his own hand, he was  NEVER going to allow that to happen again, no matter what. And yet, in saving him, Tomura had lost his little brother to the heroes all over again. He hoped Izuku would understand, somehow; maybe someday, he would return to them willingly… Or maybe, he would just put all of this out of his mind and try to beat them into the dirt the next time he saw them. With a soft groan of misery, the man got up and trudged to the doctor’s quarters, deciding to just request some sedatives and sleep off the lingering effects of the surgery as well as the bad taste this had all left in his mouth. He could deal with this tangled mess of emotions later. Shigaraki paused by the printer in the lab connected to the doctor’s suite, seeing a single sheet of paper sitting innocently in the tray. Positive. They truly were cousins, after all. With a morose sigh, he wordlessly crumpled it up and threw it in the trash.
        Notes:
          Before anything else, I'd like to clarify something: this isn't the last chapter, nor is the chapter after. There's still quite a bit of story here, we're just switching gears. c:In addition!For the month of October, Paradigm Shift will be on hiatus. Instead, I will be focusing on getting as many whumptober prompts and oneshots in general out as I can! I've never participated in one of these, so I'm excited to hop in! :yComments and Kudos are appreciated. I hope you all have a wonderful Halloween month! ^w^
