                            This is my way of wishing you all a wonderful season, filled with wonder and love. Also, my heartfelt birthday wishes to @xlisaleinx. This ficlet takes place about a year after the end of Arc II. Love, always XArc I and IIScalpel &amp; Needle - Christmas SpecialFiclet - NutmegChristmas is not only a
celebration of birth. It’s a celebration of the ones around the manger in
Bethlehem – a woman evicted of her own body for another’s salvation, a man who
loved enough to believe, three dreamers with a kingdom who dared to look at the
sky and see a star shining with promise. We gather around a table, a fireplace,
an emotion, trying to replicate that
feeling of divine touch, of finding true meaning in each other. In the family we become, either by love or will.The house smelt of
slightly charred gingerbread cookies, spilled spices on the counter and
fragrant spruce. Christmas on a can, add only water and the season’s merriment.

                            Fanfiction - Scalpel &amp; Needle II
                            Scalpel &amp; Needle (Arc I: Incision), PreviouslyScalpel &amp; Needle IIPart VII – InkedClaire slowly opened her eyes, dreamily watching the suspended
particles dancing in the golden light, streaming through the fabric of the
curtains. Her legs felt heavy, muscles substituted by lead like a tin soldier.
She had arrived terribly late from the hospital, only allowing herself to leave
her desk after finishing half of the administrative work that was pending, a
pile which seemed to relentlessly grow a couple of inches every day. When she had silently entered the darkened house, Jamie was already
asleep, curled under a blanket on the balcony. For a second Claire thought of
laying beside him and watching him sleep; let herself be soothed by the peace
he found in those moments, even if far away from her. But her body had begged
her for the relief of a spacious bed and soft mattress, and she had caved in
without much mental protest.  Yawning and stretching, the
female surgeon raised from the bed feeling mildly dizzy with tiredness,
reaching for her phone while distractedly scratching Adso’s furry – and
slightly on the overweighted side - flank. “Shit.” She cursed between
her teeth, after sleepily checking her messages. The day had just started and
already plotted to give her a headache. With a final bump on the cat’s belly -
foreshadowing a reduction on the daily rations of the gluttonous feline -,
Claire left Adso to regally claim her bed and went to the bathroom.After a quick shower – much quicker than what her body yelled it
deserved -, Claire padded to the living room. Jamie was sitting on a chair
close to the window, his forehead creased with concentration, as he
meticulously drew with a small pencil. Jamie’s therapist had suggested that drawing might be a useful
outlet for the emotions he had tried so hard to repress; or for the things that
haunted him, which he couldn’t effectively put into words. Claire had seen
flashes of his sketches, unfinished faces of unfamiliar people and shapes of
ruins, but he had never displayed them openly. Eventually, Jamie might reach a
place where he would be comfortable in sharing them with her – Claire wasn’t
sure if she was hopeful or fearful of that particular instance. “Good mornin’”. Jamie offered her a soft smile, when he finally
noticed her presence. “There’s omelette for breakfast in the stove, if you want
some.”“You made omelette?” Claire tried to sound casual, but her surprise
was evident. Jamie looked unvulgarly well-rested and in good spirits that
morning; he had shaved two days ago, hence his reddish scruff was short, smooth
and actually quite charming. “Aye.” He shrugged, clearly not wanting her to fuss about his sudden
appetite for complex food. “I woke up hungry. Skipped the smoothie today,
though – hope that’s alright.”“Sure.” She nodded, studying him carefully. The idea had occurred to
her in the shower, seeming to have entered her ear whispered by a drop of
water; it was probably too soon and undoubtedly risky, but perhaps worth
trying. “Are you terribly busy today?”“No.” His tongue peeked from the corner of his mouth, as he squinted
over a particularly troublesome part of his portrayal. “Do ye need something,
Beauchamp?”“I do.” Claire carefully sat on the edge of the sofa closer to him,
fidgeting with her hands in nervousness. “But not as Claire – as Chief.”Jamie immediately stopped the movements of his pencil, his cobalt-blue
eyes locking with hers in confusion. “I’m on leave of absence – ye put me on leave yerself. We both agreed I wasna fit to practice medicine for a
time.”“Yes – and I stand by that
decision.” She bit her bottom lip, balancing the weight of her torso on her
palms, flattened against her knees. “But I have a tumour the size of a
cantaloupe to retrieve from a retroperitoneum. Louise was scheduled to scrub in
with me, but Geillis texted me earlier to tell me she is sick.” Claire sniffed,
divided between irritation and amusement. “Apparently Louise managed to escape
chickenpox until the ripe age of thirty-two, so she is busy scratching herself
at home.” She paused to inhale deeply, anticipating his reaction. “I’m using
the Beauchamp Method and you’re the
only other surgeon who knows the technique as well as I do.”“Ye’re asking me to perform
surgery with ye.” Jamie slowly repeated, his eyes darkening. “Claire, ye
ken that’s not wise. I havena even
been inside the hospital in weeks, I canna just –““She’s twenty-years old, Jamie!” Claire protested passionately,
opening her hands in exasperation. “Barely more than a child. The surgery has
already been delayed for months, as she bounced between surgeons who told her
it was inoperable. The window to save her is almost closing.”“I dinna ken if I’m ready.” He swallowed hard, but in his eyes there
was a small glint – a seed of resolution. A
man called to arms. “My presence might hinder ye more than help ye.”“Are you willing to find out?” She pressed, the corner of her mouth
twitching in an encouraging smile. “Because I
am.”***Walking with Jamie through the corridors of the hospital had been a
harrowing experience. Nurses, doctors and orderlies glared at him with eyes the
size of new planets - some seemingly trying to locate him on the shelves of
their memories, as if the tome of his identity had been lost; others with the
shock of recognition, that quickly turned into pity and discomfort. A few dared
to throw him a cautious smile, and actually stopped to pat him on the back, stating
that he had been missed. Claire had grown accustomed to his dramatic physical
change, but seeing it again through the eyes of others had been enlightening in
the most painful way. “Missed this?” She asked him, as they started to scrub in together.
Jamie had seen the CT scans and had donned the usual blue scrubs of the Royal Infirmary. There was a dangerous
swirl of memories about the body that hid underneath them – from before -, whispering too close to the
surface. She couldn’t afford to lose herself to the embrace of such reveries.“Feels good.” He smiled shyly, spreading the foamy soap on his
forearms, almost reaching the elbows. “I reckon this is as much a ritual to
find the appropriate mindset, as a way to prevent infection.” His eyes glanced
to the inside of the operating theatre, where the anaesthetist was already
working on the young patient. “I missed seeing ye here as well – where ye
always looked the happiest.”“I’m truly content here.” Claire admitted, activating the water tap.
“But you’re wrong. I’ve been happier in other
places.” She could feel Jamie’s stare, fixed between her shoulder blades, as
she moved to enter the OR with her hands raised before her. As she was being
gloved and gowned by the assisting nurse, Claire wondered if he would dare to
ask her about those other happy places – and what would she say then? His bed. Her bed, but only
when it smelled of him. The locker room floor, whenever he was sitting next to her.
The rooftop, when he gave her his father’s pendant, to keep her anchored.  Every inch of floor where she had been
pressed down by his body, the cold tiles kissing her skin along with his hot mouth.
She had been happy. He had
made her happy. Claire wished she had been able to tell him how much, then.The first steps of the surgery went smoothly, Claire leading the way
and Jamie assisting with simple motions – suction
here, retract there. But as they
approached the critical point of the surgery, the removal of the tumour itself
and subsequent anastomosis attempt, Claire noticed how Jamie’s hands started to
shake. It wasn’t a blatant tremor, the kind that would elicit scandalized
looks from the instrumentalist nurse or catch the eye of the resident
accompanying them; but it was enough to unbalance him, to make him question
himself, the finesse of his movements with the blade lost to the doubts of his
mind. “Jamie.” She called him in a soft whisper, her voice muffled by the
surgical mask. “It’s alright.” “Ye should call another surgeon to assist ye, Doctor Beauchamp.” He
flexed his glove-covered hand, his long fingers gripping the handle of the scalpel
in his hand. Above the rim of his mask, the blue of his eyes seemed bottomless
and much darker. “No.” Claire said, her
voice sounding absolutely calm – controlled.
“You are here. We both are. You’ve got this, Fraser.”“I canna seem to recall the next step in the procedure, Doctor
Beauchamp.” Jamie stated softly, but his melodic voice dripped with a warning.
His body was trying to shut down, to recoil into a safe place, away from the
memories linked to the last time he had been holding a scalpel in his hands. In
such a scenario, his memory might fail completely, and they were vulnerable to
a mistake. “Don’t think.” The female surgeon searched his eyes with hers,
nodding in incentive. Their hands met briefly in the sterile field, a quick
brush of fingertips, magnetized by the thrum of blood.  “Just move with me, Scalpel.”In a time when being lovers had seemed like an anecdote to her - and
a thoroughly improbable dream to him -, still they had found an unparalleled synchrony
of actions within the OR, a cadence that went beyond the necessity of words, as
if their bodies already knew that they were meant to move together. Such things weren’t easily forgotten.***“Doctor Fraser.” Claire
grinned when she entered the house, her hands occupied with a box of fragrant
pizza, the scent of oregano, tomato and melted cheese drifting pleasantly along
the hallway. “Brought a much-deserved dinner to our small victory party.”The surgery had been, by all standards, a success – the tumour was removed with clear margins, and the
patient had come out of the anaesthesia with a smile on her lips, as if she
already knew the outcome by the sense of lightness inside her. Jamie seemed on
the verge of fainting from exhaustion and relief once they were finished, so
Claire had sent him home to rest while she finished her duties for the day.“Let me help ye.” Jamie stretched his left hand to grab the
cardboard box and she immediately noticed the bandage around his wrist. “What’s this?” She questioned, alarmed, imprisoning his hand on a vice
grip. Her lips felt numb, cold. “Did
you cut yourself?” Self-mutilation had been one of her many concerns about him,
her eyes always scanning him for signs of any hidden cuts.“Of course not.” Jamie gawked at her, his eyes widening in shock. “Christ!
I made a tattoo.” He shrugged unfazed, as if going to a tattoo parlour was part
of his regular activities.“A tattoo?” It was Claire’s turn to stare at him, puzzled, her mouth
slightly ajar. “I thought you said there was nothing else you wanted marking
your body forever.”“I changed my mind.” He tilted his head in amusement, raising a
brow. “Do ye want to see it?”“Do you want to show me?” Claire
rebutted, placing the food on the counter and crossing her arms. Without responding, Jamie starting to unfold the bandage around his
wrist, spinning it around. The white fabric finally fell at his feet and he
offered her his arm, palm up.The word inked there was simple enough to comprehend; what rendered
her speechless was the lettering used, a sense of strangeness followed by
sudden familiarity as she recognized her own handwriting. ScalpelJamie had tattooed the word on the soft skin inside his left wrist,
the small characters probably copied from the letters she had written him, back
when he didn’t have another name to her. It was both of them, together in seven letters – what he was and what he meant to
her. “This way I’ll remember.” He said haltingly, a tinge of crimson painting
his high cheekbones. “Even when ye’re not
with me. Because today, for the first time in a long time, I felt in
control.” Claire enveloped his hand and
brought the sensitive skin – covered with a thin plastic film – to her lips,
pressing a soft kiss above the black letters. She felt Jamie’s body relaxing and, framing
his face – still much too gaunt, much too haunted -, kissed him softly on
the lips.

                            Fanfiction - Scalpel &amp; Needle II
                            Scalpel &amp; Needle (Arc I: Incision), PreviouslyScalpel &amp; Needle IIPart VI – Moment of
TangencyTime and wounds - there is an indelible relationship between them.
When a significant amount of time has passed over an open wound, it becomes
unsafe to close it with a suture, the risk of infection being too great. The
only benign option remaining is to leave to the body the arduous task of
bridging the gap by itself, closing by secondary intention. A wound touched by
time in such a manner will never truly heal; instead it blossoms with scar
tissue that might fade, but never truly disappears. “I was here”, time will tell through the skin, “And you won’t forget it.” Time doesn’t
actually heal all wounds - but it
might grant us functional scars. Jamie had scars aplenty, figurative and literal, that he cautiously
shared with Claire over the next few weeks. Sometimes words streamed out of
him, as if he couldn’t wait to be purged of such afflictions; other times, it
was no more than a look filled with renewed pain, a hand searching for hers in
the confessional of darkness.The man that now bore Jamie’s striking blue eyes and attractive face
was much quieter than he used to be. Silence surrounded him, like an
unbreachable armour, oppressing in its nature. Claire yearned to fill in that
silence with words that could reach him, but usually allowed him to dictate the
rhythm of their conversations. “Hey.” Claire greeted from the sofa, where she had installed herself
for a lazy-Friday-off-work, shifting
her attention from the television to a newly-arrived Jamie, whose face was
stuck in a grimace. Although still distant from his usual healthy figure, he
had managed to regain a couple of pounds under Claire’s unwavering efforts.
“You look like something Adso dragged in. What’s the matter, Fraser?”“Headache.” Jamie whispered, as if the mere act of talking was
excruciating. “My head hurts like a fiend.” “Oh.” She looked at him with
concern swirling in her whiskey-coloured eyes. “Did you take something for the
pain?”“Some Ibuprofen, but didna help much.” He sighed and slumped on the
couch next to her, missing her propped up feet by mere inches. “Do ye have
something stronger around?”“Probably.” Claire said haltingly, studying his face intently. “But
I’m not sure you should be doing strong painkillers.” Her eyes softened, as she
tried to gently convey her concerns, without making veiled insinuations. “Given
everything you went through, you are at risk for addictive behavior.” As
doctors, they were both painfully aware that people experiencing post-traumatic
stress disorder were fairly vulnerable to destructive relationships with
alcohol and drugs, amongst other vices. Jamie had already been on the verge, unreservedly
plunging on a glass of liquid forgetfulness, when Claire came to him at his
apartment. “Aye.” Jamie avoided her gaze, suddenly seeming to be absorbed by
the interior design extravaganza playing on the telly. Claire knew it was hard
for him to be permanently under a microscope, his every action studied for
possible future ripples. “Ye’re right, of course.”“There are other ways to help with the pain, though.” The female
surgeon proposed cheerfully, trying to break the tense moment. “More natural ways.” Claire opened her mouth to correct herself, blatantly realizing how
that particular remark had sounded,
but a faint shade of pink had already appeared on the tips of Jamie’s ears.
Looking simultaneously scandalized and interested, his eyes travelled from her
face to her breasts – modestly covered by her somewhat unflattering sweater, thankfully - in quick succession. “Not that!” Claire
protested, although she was acutely aware of the heat of his body, so close to
her on the confines of the sofa. “I meant exercise!
We should go for a hike.”“Alright.” There was a hint of amused disappointment in Jamie’s
smirk. “Ye suggesting a workout,
lass.” Jamie shook his head in feigned disbelief, grimacing when the pain
intensified with the movement. “Lead the way, Beauchamp’s doppelgänger.”Claire snorted with mirth, throwing him a cautionary look. “Maybe
that’s why you have that headache – all that wit trying to come out at once, Fraser.”***The air was crisp on the summit of Arthur’s Seat, with teeth enough to prickle the skin, like a
fervent kiss from a windy open mouth. Jamie and Claire had crossed half the
city well into Holyrood Park, in a
pace that was a short step away from running, and then rapidly started the
ascension. On their way over to the top, they had passed and greeted a couple
of hikers already starting the descend and were pleasantly surprised when they
discovered themselves all alone. The surgeons sat in companionable silence,
catching their breaths as their eyes drank thirstily from the beautiful shades
of red and orange over Edinburgh. Claire looked at Jamie from the corner of her eyes and was
thoroughly satisfied by the beautiful shade of pink on his cheeks, his headache
entirely forgotten after his body had been properly exhausted into submission. It
was a moment of peace for him – those were still fairly rare and precious –, so Claire was content with
just watching him be. For a moment,
she dreamily thought of leaning her head against his shoulder and falling
asleep with the city at their feet; her entire body curled against his skin,
coming alive with sweat. She was deeply attuned with Jamie’s dispositions after weeks of dutifully
watching over him, so Claire immediately noticed when the air hitched inside
his throat. “What’s the matter?” Her voice sounded weird to her own ears, as if
it didn’t belong so close to the clouds, too heavy to be on top of a hill.“I had a glimpse, just now. A
moment of tangency.” He shook his head, thoughts like stubborn grains of sand
he could shake away from his mind. Jamie’s lips curled in a sorrowful smile.
“Of what life could have been – if I had stayed.”“Oh.” Claire babbled in questioning tone, offering just enough
careful incentive to hopefully keep him talking.“We’d come here often, whenever our schedules at the hospital allowed
us. I’d drag ye and ye’d pretend to come unwillingly.” He breathed deeply,
experiencing the air as if it might have turned into poison in between his
words. “Maybe I’d touch ye, if we
were alone - if I was feeling particularly reckless and you being willing. All
those bonnie noises ye’d make for me, scattered over Edinburgh.” His eyes were
dark, gone into a place where the light wasn’t able to touch them. “This might
have been the place where we make the decision of moving in together – where
I’d ask ye to marry me.”“I’m not really the marrying type.” Claire pointed with alacrity, determined
to hold on to the edges of her shields, so close to come crumbling down under
the force of the battering ram of his words. She could see it too, that
beautiful “what if”, painted in the
sky above them like a watercolour. “Ach, well.” He clicked
his tongue, as if she was entirely missing the point – she tenaciously was. “But it was a possibility, then.”“You talk as if you are hopeless of ever being that man again.”
Claire brushed her hair to the side to better look at his face, curls flogging
the back of her neck like a whip. “As if you are mourning yourself.”“I might build a life for myself in time.” Jamie hesitated, as if
the words might materialize and break in front of his eyes, blinding him with
the shards. “But I’ll never be the man I once was. A bit more, and a whole lot less,
but never again the same. When I was a lad, I had atrocious growing pains –
being so tall and all.” He shrugged, as if apologizing for his outrageous
height. “It’s like experiencing all that pain compressed in a single second, every day. Ye learn to live with it, but
it costs ye. Sometimes, it seems to cost ye everything ye ever had.”There was not much Claire could say - to contradict him would be telling
a blatant lie; to accept the reality in his words would be to accept that he
harboured a pain she could not heal. In
silence, like in moments of tangency, everything was again possible. “Did she know?” Claire cleared her throat after a while, when it
became clear he was starting to retreat into himself again. He did not seek it,
the distance – it came for him,
uninvited, like a howl in the woods. “Did she – Mary – know about me?”The topic had been carefully avoided by the both of them for the
past few weeks. The nurse working for the Doctors
Without Borders mission was the hole that threatened to break the dam so
shakily constructed, which allowed them to co-exist in a resemblance of harmony.
But Claire felt it was time; her
anger might start to fester, opening a hideous wound that would bleed between
them. “Aye. She knew.” Jamie
confirmed, absentmindedly playing with the thin steam of nearby wild flower.
“Afterwards, she wouldna stop apologizing. Begged me to let her write to ye, to
explain things and make ye understand.” He closed his eyes for a moment, as if
he could still see the regret in Mary’s eyes in front of him, reflecting his
own. “I told her that I would handle things.”“And by handle I assume
you really meant push me away.”
Claire said harshly, her lips pursing.“Mary had just ended a verra bad marriage. Her husband was an uncaring
man, as quick with his temper as with his words. Mary finally filed for divorce,
just shortly before she went to Syria. The scoundrel waited for her, outside
the hospital where she used to work, and beat her senseless for it.” Jamie’s
troubled eyes searched for hers. “Mary didna want me, the same as I didna
want her. But she was afraid to die and didna want to leave this world with
only the memory of violence upon her.”  He
sharply inhaled the brisk air. “It doesna
justify what happened, but connection
was all she sought from me. Humanity
was all I sought from her.”“You truly think this is just about the kiss?” Claire snorted humourlessly, shaking her head. Her
temper was starting to rise, along with the wind around them. “Yes, I felt
betrayed and my pride and self-esteem took a serious hit. But that alone didn’t
break my heart.” Her chin quivered a little, her eyes seemingly hypnotized by
Jamie’s. “What truly hurt me is that you didn’t trust me to love you enough.”“Claire.” Jamie’s
faltering voice was almost a plea. “I didna want ye to feel obligated to stay
with me, when I knew the man ye loved wouldna be coming back.”“Yes, I’m sure there were
plenty of noble and self-sacrificing notions on your part.” Claire bit the
inside of her cheek, watching the leaves swirling around, powerless against the
air that moved them. “But can you honestly tell me you didn’t think I couldn’t
handle it? That I would get cold feet and run for the hills at the first sign
of trouble?”“Ye gave yerself over to me slowly.” He whispered back, slightly
tilting his head. “I knew being part of a couple didna come easily to ye. I
cherished whatever ye gave me, but still there was a part of ye that ye kept to
yerself. Tentative. Guarded.”“But I did give myself
over to you.” Claire’s lips felt numb
– it might be the cold creeping in, or the ice that filled her veins. “Even overwhelming
fear couldn’t stop me. I gave you as much as I had to give. And I wasn’t in it
just to take strength from you - solely
to take away whatever I needed.”“I thought –“ Jamie started, but Claire raised a hand, her palm
stretched in his direction to silence his protests.“You pushed me away – removed yourself
from my life, for as long as you could – to protect yourself from the off
chance that I would choose to leave.”
Her chest felt constricted, as if everything was trying to come out, crawling
through her circulation to the surface at once. “Let it be my choice – my choice, damn you!” There was moistness on her cheeks, but Claire didn’t bother wiping
it away. Jamie’s eyes were filled with tears, a waveless sea bursting with new
currents. “I should ha’known how brave ye truly are.” Jamie said in a husky
voice. “I shouldn’t have doubted ye.”“No.” She agreed. “You shouldn’t have. Not without me giving you a reason to. I might be fucked up, but I stand my ground. I know
how to love properly.”“I used to love ye as a man loves a woman.” He confessed slowly,
touching her cheek with tentative fingertips. “Deeply, aye, but simply enough.”
Jamie traced her temple, his thumb lightly stroking the centre of her forehead,
as if in benediction. “But now I think I love ye as only a soul can love
another soul. Ye are putting me back together and ye’re leaving something of
yerself inside me.”“You still have work to do.” Claire’s hand enfolded his, caressing
the knotty knuckles of his hand. “Maybe for the rest of your life there will be
nights when you have to sleep on the balcony. But maybe – maybe there is a way for us
going forward. But there can be no fear between
us, only around us.”Their shadowy figures were getting longer, announcing the coming of
the night, when people were left alone to brave their way without a dark likeness
of themselves. Soon enough the surgeons would have to make their way back home;
but there was a fragile understanding in that place that was hard to abandon.“In spite of every tragedy you witnessed – of everything that happened,” Claire gently asked him, when she found
words again. “Have you found your purpose there? What you were looking for?”“Aye.” Jamie looked tenderly at her and his eyes were limpid enough
for her to see herself reflected there. “I believe I have.”

Sometimes you invest beyond the line, care a little too much, let them under your skin until there is no skin at all to protect you.” – @kalendraashtar​I  cry everytime I read this.  I know this feeling and pain so well as I have spent  30 years working in various ICUs as a critical care nurse and another 10 as a nurse practitioner. I can touch someone and feel their body’s brokenness.  I can touch someone and know if today will be their last. It is a heavy weight to carry sometimes, but it is mine. I am a healer. This is what I am and what I do. Thank you Kalendraashtar for so succinctly putting into words describing this aspect of our professional life.Heart too full for words. Thank you for everything you are and everything you do. ❤️🙌

                            Scalpel &amp; Needle (Arc I: Incision), PreviouslyScalpel &amp; Needle IIPart V – Tell It To The
Moon“Did you sleep well, Fraser?” Claire asked causally, as Jamie
entered her kitchen, barefooted but respectfully wearing a large t-shirt and
loose sweat pants. She knew painfully well that he preferred to sleep – and sometimes
walk around the house – only in his underwear or even naked. He shrugged without saying a word and patted Adso, who was nagging
Claire in order to conquer an early breakfast, since both the night and his
appetite had been extensive.  Throughout
the dark hours, Claire had heard Jamie trashing in the bedroom adjacent to her
own, the spring mattress being on the overused and whinny side, so the question
had been fundamentally rhetorical.“Did ye make coffee already?” He asked in a very hoarse voice, as if
his vocal cords weren’t entirely aware of his wakefulness.  “Yes.” Claire smiled smugly, presenting him with a huge glass,
filled to the brim with a green and viscous liquid. “And you can have a bucket,
as soon as you finish your smoothie.”
Jamie stared blankly at the glass and winced. Jamie still maintained a stubborn avoidance of a proper diet,
jumping meals and filling his plate with a portion that would be no more than
an appetizer to Adso. Ignoring his vehement protests with a squint that was
pure steel, Claire had started to concoct a smoothie for his breakfast that
consisted of several fruits, vegetables, seeds and a pinch of protein powder.
The potion – varying between grassy green, muddy burgundy and radioactive
yellow – carried her high hopes for him to regain some weight and avoid an anaemia
from vitamin deficits. “Tastes like heather.” Jamie scowled above the rim of the glass. He
peeked at the kitchen counter, trying to decipher the ingredients she had used
in such a despicable recipe. “Works for the sheep.” Claire pointed optimistically. “All fat and
energetic.”“Are ye herding me then?” He raised his brows, almost smiling. Almost.“Oh, pinch your nose if you must!” She tried to hide an amused grin,
watching the look of profound aversion he directed to the liquid. “Or you can go to therapy without coffee.
How was it yesterday, by the way?”The previous day Jamie had gone to his third appointment with a therapist
specialized in post-traumatic stress disorder, who had been enthusiastically
recommended to her after a few discreet inquiries at the hospital. He had
arrived home late, when she was already snuggling in bed with a book,
pretending not to keep a diligent watch on his movements. The glimpse she had
caught of his face as he entered his impromptu accommodations had scared her –
he looked a generous inch beyond devastation. “I’d verra much like not to speak at all, to be honest.” Jamie
gulped half of the glass’ content, clicking his tongue in distaste. “Everything
feels – heightened, after each
session. Raw, as if every wound I’ve
ever made would maybe bleed again.”“That’s good.” Claire patiently munched on her slightly burnt toast,
trying not to look too eager. Too hopeful.
Too invested. “Bleeding is always
better than scar tissue, that leads nowhere in healing properly.” It was the
practicality of a surgeon, but accurate when applied to wounds or spirits.After finishing his juice, while Claire studied some forms from the
hospital with small notes written on the margin – budgets, OR schedules, the rotation of the new residents, complaints
from a few disgruntled patients who would prefer a softer bed or a smaller
suture -, Jamie filled a mug with dark simple coffee and sat again
examining his fingers. She waited for him to say whatever he had been preparing
so nervously, playing with her pen as if the growing number of appendicectomies
constituted a complex conundrum. “The therapist suggested that I told ye stories about – there.” Jamie finally said, his voice
low. His eyes were fixing Adso, masterfully licking the bottom of his plate
with his pinkish tongue. “A bit each day, he said.”“And do you want to?” Claire entwined her hands on top of the table,
her whole body indicating full attention, her eyes gentle but direct. “I want ye to know.” He sighed, scratching the stubble that had not
been shaved for several days. Hygiene wasn’t optional under Claire’s roof – she
had threatened to clean his ears with the toilet brush if he didn’t comply -,
but she had conceded on the overgrown beard. “And I dinna want to feel so numb. A man permanently underwater. If I
tell ye these things maybe the present will start feeling more real.”“Alright.” She nodded softly, brushing away a tenacious curl. Claire
tried not to look too expectant.Jamie remained silent for a time; if the pain of such memories made
him unable to talk for a moment, or if he was trying to decide where to start,
Claire wasn’t entirely sure. “Ye were their favourite story.” “What?” She asked, puzzled. He raised his eyes to her and smiled, shy
but decided. There was something undefinable about his face, as if he had just
come to the surface after prolonged immersion, experiencing the blessing of
cold air in his lungs all over again.“The Syrian doctors and nurses I worked with. When we had a moment
of respite, I used to tell them about ye – our
story.” His lips twitched on a lopsided smirk. “I told them about this extraordinary
lass who hated my guts and how lucky I was when she changed her mind. Some of
them barely had any English, but somehow, they all understood.  Love was common ground, aye?” Jamie licked his
lips, slightly shrugging. “I showed them photos of ye – not all of them, of course.” There was a faint tinge of pink on his
cheeks. “Some were just for me.”“That’s –“ Claire hawked, trying with all her resolve to disperse
the knot inside her throat. She couldn’t allow herself to break everytime he
was strong enough to share something with her. “Thank you for telling me.”Jamie nodded and grabbed the jacket he had left dangling from the
back of a chair. “I remembered ye.” He whispered softly, his fingers playing
with the buttons. “I remembered ye always.”***It had been an unusually long day, with multiple surgeries pilling
in sequence, until Claire couldn’t even remember the exact name linked to the
flesh she was cutting. It was a day built on flashes of sterile gloves, her commanding
voice asking for “scissors” and “suction”, rounds of antibiotics quickly
prescribed in recovery, the blue of scrubs and surgical fields so intense it
all seemed like an endless sea. Thankfully, it had also been a day of hopeful and
relieved smiles on the waiting room, when she opened the door to give away encouraging
news. Exhausted, she had arrived home and collapsed on the bed for a short
nap before dinner; awaking with a startled gasp well past midnight, fully clothed
and sweaty. The explanation for the rough awakening became evident as soon as
the buzzing inside her ears diluted – she could hear the heart-wrenching wails
and sobs on the room next door.Feeling that the situation went far beyond his recurring nightmares,
she slowly walked to Jamie’s bedroom. The closed door seemed like a warning not
to trespass on his stoic suffering, but Claire blatantly ignored it. His need for her surpassed all the rest.He was laying on his side, his firmly closed eyelids indicating he
was fast asleep. There were traces of tears on his face, glistening on the
scarce light flooding the room, like cobwebs made of silver. Jamie was naked,
save from the crumpled sheet around his waist, and beads of sweat coated his
body like little open mouths ready to cry out. The room smelt of terror and sandalwood,
like the den of an injured animal.Claire sat on the edge of the bed, covering her mouth when he moaned
and sobbed again in his sleep. “Fraser.”
She attempted, gently touching the side of his face. His skin was very warm and
sticky to the touch. “Jamie.” Claire
insisted in a firmer voice, her hand travelling to his forehead. No fever, but
his body was certainly struggling. “Scalpel!”.
She called out, gripping his face with both of her palms. He trashed against
her touch, trying to escape it, but she applied more pressure of her body
against his, willing her palms to become a safe haven for him. “It’s alright. You’re home. I’m here.”He widened his eyes, coming out of sleep with a jump, his breathing
laboured. For a moment, Claire thought he didn’t recognize her, her face
blurring into a million different ones, features of loss and guilt he couldn’t
allow himself to forget. “Claire.” He croaked, his trembling hands covering hers. “It’s me.” She asserted, her index finger
tenderly tracing his brow. “You were dreaming.” He nodded and gulped, adjusting
the moist sheet around him to better cover himself, as he realized she was indeed
very real and palpable. “Get dressed and come with me.” Claire slightly turned her back to allow him
some privacy as he fumbled with his pyjama pants, the concept of not openly
sharing their bodies still foreign and unnatural. When he hawked, indicating he
was suitably covered, she nodded and waved for him to follow her. As Jamie stood on the cold floor of the living
room, looking lost and misplaced, Claire went into her closet and came back
armed with a large grey sleeping bag. She opened the doors to the wide balcony,
the full moon smiling on the starry sky like an open eye, witnessing everything
at a safe distance.“I read that adjusting to their previous life can
be tasking to people who were in conflict zones.” She explained naturally, as
she prepared what seemed like a camping bed outside, amidst the vases of her
balcony. “It might help to find references that were similar between both
places, so it doesn’t seem like a sudden change.”“I dinna understand –“ Jamie started, furrowing
his brow in puzzlement. “The moon and the stars are the same, are they
not?” Claire smiled a little, tilting her chin to indicate the sky outside. “I
don’t think there’s much else in common between my house and a hospital in Syria,
but that might work.”“Aye.” He agreed, his voice husky. “I used to
look at the sky at night and think it was almost strange, to have something sae
beautiful, still there, amidst such a place.”“Get comfortable then.” She encouraged him,
pointing to the bed she had composed with feathery pillows from the sofa and a patterned
quilt. “The weather is quite nice, so you should be alright.”“Will ye stay?” Jamie asked hurriedly, words
coming forcibly out of his mouth, like bullets that might wound him if contained.
“I won’t touch ye, I promise. I just –
dinna want to be alone tonight.”“Fine.” Claire said cheerfully, as if the
thought of being in close proximity with his vulnerability didn’t give her any
pause. “Scoot over and try not to snore, bloody
Scot.”They laid on their backs, avoiding to touch each
other even in passing, Claire cosily lulled by Jamie’s steadier breathing. Adso appeared on the
balcony and sniffed her hair, questioning the motives for such odd behaviour,
and came to happily nestle between their legs.
“The therapist says I have a bad case of
survivor’s guilt.” He said softly. She didn’t turn her head to look at him, tracing
constellations with invisible fingertips; she might kiss him if she did. “I can’t
forgive myself and did my best for ye not to forgive me either. Did my best to
destruct everything I had.”“Did you?” Claire asked to the stars. “Do your best?”“Aye.” He whispered somewhere, achingly close to
her ear. “Your best is not that good, then. Because I’m
still here – thoroughly pissed, but laying on my back in my own balcony
just to be beside you, Fraser.”“I dinna deserve ye.” Jamie said in a rumble.
Claire’s fingers lightly caressed the back of his hand. “Regardless of where we end up,” She whispered
back. “That is for me – and only me – to decide.
Strop trying to convince me.”He talked then, in a voice that was no more than
a caress to the moon. Stray words and fragmented sentences, mostly in Gaelic; confessions the absence of
light made less frightening, elusive, shooting up to the sky like firecrackers.
And Claire saw the man remaining, illuminated by those painful admissions, and felt
nothing but love.

                            Fanfiction - Scalpel &amp; Needle II
                            Scalpel &amp; Needle (Arc I: Incision), PreviouslyScalpel &amp; Needle IIPart IV – Sin-Eater5 years agoJamie half-opened the door, curious about the voice softly humming
inside the locker room. His heart tap-danced on the space between his lungs,
inviting them to breathe joy along with the unsteady rhythm. In the last few weeks he had noticed a reluctance about her anytime
he was near, as if he had turned contagious and she feared to be mortally
infected. It was a cautiousness of touches and glances, more than open animosity.
He had spent countless nights wondering what might have caused such a rift
between them and, more importantly, how to correct it. Because when the light coming from the window of the locker room hit
her face, carefree and relaxed singing along a song only she could hear, James
Fraser knew he would love Claire Beauchamp until asystole. He didn’t know the
cause of his death yet, but he already knew who would be on his mind.  He was sure she would be able to make him
smile, even then. The small earring in her helix, bearing a white stone, glinted in
the sun and Jamie craved to place his mouth on top of it, kissing her there, on
the edge of cartilage and woman. If he opened the door completely he feared he
would become irrevocably inebriated – her creamy skin underneath the blue
scrubs, her soft voice, her quick sharpness - a state made torturous by the
need to disguise it. “Beauchamp.” Jamie eventually called out, his voice sounding
strangely normal in the warm room. He strolled inside, closing the door behind
him. “Did the surgery went well, then?”“Ah, Fraser.” Claire
looked at him with raised brows, slightly suspicious, as if defying him to
admit he had been spying on her. “It went very well. Mister Raymond will make a
full recovery.”“I’m glad.” Jamie rolled his shoulders casually, leaning against the
locker next to hers. Her proximity made him tense sometimes, his body always on
the verge of engaging – on fight, love, storms
between them. “Ye ken what they say about the man, aye? The nurses and
such?”“I’m not as familiar with
the nurses as you, Fraser.” The female surgeon replied pointedly, neatly
folding her surgical cap. “He is a patient needing my help and that is enough
for me.”“Ach.” Jamie hawked in his Scottish boom. “They say he is a sin-eater. A verra powerful one at that.”“A sin-eater?” Claire wrinkled her forehead in confusion. Jamie
longed to brush those lines away with the tip of his fingers, maybe attempt at
drawing them with sharpened pencil, immersed in the shadows of a bedroom.“Aye.” He nodded sheepishly, offering her a lopsided smile. “A
sin-eater is capable of devouring sins, absolving the soul of another. They
carry them from that point on, so the person can be free and find redemption.”“Scottish lore, is it?” Claire snorted, amused at this naiveté, quickly
checking her phone for new messages before placing it in her bag. “Nah.” Jamie shook his head, distractedly playing with the bell of
his stethoscope. “He isna Scottish. But I find it quite interesting, anyway.”“Yes.” She smiled softly, her eyes the colour of slightly burnt butterscotch,
sweet with just enough bitterness to make it rich. “But isn’t that the role of the people who love us the most? Sharing our sins, helping us bear them, so that in
time we can learn to live with them?” Claire shook her head almost imperceptibly,
a faint – sad - smile still on her
lips. “Not that I would know anything
about that.” She patted his arm in
goodbye – too rushed, too fleeting - and strode towards the door. “Either
way, Mister Raymond is on a liquid diet at the moment, so I wouldn’t go on a
killing spree if I were you. No eating for him until his bowel decides to move
again.”Present timeClaire knocked on the door, trying to ignore the little whisper of
the key of his apartment inside her small bag. The door between them had
closed, in more ways than one, and using the key was a step she wasn’t prepared
to take. Silence. Stillness. She practically banged the second time around,
hearing a small rustle inside the apartment that indicated that either Jamie or
Adso were present and accounted for. As the lock was slowly opening – with
enough hasps for it to look like the gate of a prison – Claire had to admit
that, given the necessity of thumbs for such a task, probably the human
inhabitant was somewhere to be found beyond the door.Jamie’s appearance hadn’t changed much in the
week that separated them from their last meeting, when he had confessed the real
depth of his brokenness. If anything, he looked very much unkept and battered,
his short hair unpleasantly perspired, his shirt wrinkled to a point where it
would have discouraged even the fiercest iron. “Claire.
Ye’re here.” He said with surprise at the sight of her, his blue red-rimmed
eyes dilating like the pupils of a cat in the dark. His speech was a tad
slurred, rolling the syllables with a gusto that couldn’t entirely be
attributed to his proud Scottishness. He smelled of stale sweat, something
salty like algae exposed on the low tide and spilled whiskey. Stinking drunk, indeed.“So it seems, Fraser.” Claire replied dryly, raising her brows. Fraser was safe, whereas Jamie was not. Jamie was a name that meant something else, visible only when her
barriers were down, when their breathings synched in the dead of night and the
world seemed to sigh along. Adso appeared at the door, peeking from behind
Jamie’s significantly skinnier legs, with big pleading orbs. Claire could have
sworn he was about to smack his owner’s calves and roll his eyes in protest for
being abandoned to deal with such a reprehensive human being.“I tried to call first.” She hesitantly strode
inside the apartment, after Jamie had signalled for her to enter. “But you
didn’t pick up your phone and your house number seems to be disconnected.” Her
observant eyes noticed several broken pieces of furniture and pottery, shards
like lines of ants travelling on the floor, and the landline had been ripped
from the plug – from the hole on the wall, she would say it had been quite a
violent affair. Claire conjectured if Jamie simply felt more at ease amidst
chaos in those days. Familiar. “Redecorating are you?” She joked,
carefully pushing aside some wreckage with the tip of her foot. “Something like it. Went minimalist.” Jamie
replied faintly. He was watching her intently, as if expecting her to vanish in
the next few seconds. There were at least four empty beer bottles in the coffee
table and probably other testaments of liquor nestling in the garbage bin.
Sobriety was a state in which ghosts tended to dwell.“I’m not here as your – your lover.” She said the word harshly, with
fresh resentment prickling her tongue. “I’m here as a friend - and as your Chief.” Claire pursed her full lips,
fixing a point slightly above his right shoulder, that would give a
satisfactory impression of looking straight at him. “Besides, I was worried
about Adso.”“I take good care of the wee cheetie.” Jamie protested,
although the assertion of his capacities for pet-parenting wasn’t particularly
enhanced by the fact that he could barely stand up straight without stumbling.“Well, he bathes himself at least.” Claire retorted, crossing her arms. “Your
vacation time ends the day after tomorrow. If you want to step inside my
surgical department again, I’m advising that you seek therapy.” She inhaled
sharply. “Mandatory therapy, to be
more accurate.”“I dinna need therapy.” Jamie glared at her, his eyelids partially closed,
wakefulness weighing heavily on him. She could sense the pull of him, like a
magnet or a black hole, pulling her to a place with no gravity, no rules. “I just need –““Don’t.”
Claire hissed, raising a warning finger. She knew what he was about to say, as
if he had drummed it with his fingers, his tongue, his blood, deep into her eardrum. You. I just need you. “You
need to heal yourself, so I can be properly angry at you. You need to come back while you still can.”“I dinna have a map, Claire.” He whispered
drunkenly, although the words resonated as honest between them. A man lost
between the debris of his old life; trying to navigate backwards against the
roaring surge that stubbornly propelled him towards the abyss.  “Fortunately for you, I have an excellent sense
of direction – and therapy is the way forward.” Claire assured, more softly
than she intended. “You need to take a shower while I pack you a bag and
accommodate Adso to go as well. You’ll both stay at my place for some time.”“Yer place?” Jamie furrowed his brow, his face
the colour of overnight oats. “I canna. It’s no’ fair to ye.”“I’m not inviting you to my bed.” Claire explained haltingly, grabbing a couple of bottles
to carry to the trash. “Things between us have
changed. You’ll stay in the guest room. Besides, I have to save the entire city
of Edinburgh – we’re in danger of an alcohol drought very soon, if you keep
this up.”“Why are ye doing this? Ye should be far away
from me.” The male surgeon leaned against the wall, incapable of remaining
firmly grounded on the floor without an aid. “I betrayed ye. Betrayed yer trust. My weakness – disgusts me.” If Jamie could crawl out
of his skin, Claire unquestionably believed he would in that moment. He would
march around, skinless, exhibiting
the frail thing within.“You hurt me – yes.” Her voice quivered, as she scooped Adso to place him in the
carrier. Her back was blissfully turned away from Jamie, so he couldn’t see her
face. Like boiling water, parting and swelling with emotion, so close to becoming
mist only to pour down again. “I won’t pretend that I fully understand what you
went through and how you bonded with people who shared the same journey. This
is not forgiveness.” She breathed
deeply, air hitching inside her airway. “But I meant what I’ve told you, that
last night together before you were gone. I might have told it only once; but
for me it was the same as if I’ve said it forever. And that makes me responsible
in seeing you safe.” I love
you. “I have broken
yer heart.” Jamie whispered, his head tilted back. “And I dinna know how to
mend it, in spite of what I promised ye.”“You can start by going into the shower.” Claire
gulped, swallowing the tears that formed in the corners of her eyes, that left
her so willing to open her heart and cradle him inside. She busied herself around the living room and
bedroom, discarding garbage and collecting items he might need while he stayed
with her, overhearing the distant noise of the shower running. Claire
stubbornly closed the eye of her mind against the vision of his body, former or
present. It had been a vessel to come together – tenderly, playfully, lovingly, entirely - but now was just another
vehicle for Jamie to punish himself.A loud racket coming from the bathroom caused
her to run to the door like an arrow, ignoring Adso who meowed in outrage from
his closed carrier.  In his altered state Jamie had lost his balance
while trying to reach the towel and - amidst a rainfall of soap, shampoo
bottles and foamy water – had fallen against the tiled floor, cutting his bottom
lip which bled profusely.  “Fuck.”
Claire swore, kneeling next to him on the floor. She expediently examined his
pupils and searched his scalp for any further damages. “Couldna have said it better myself.” Jamie
stammered, looking dazed. His lip was swelling visibly.Within moments, Claire had managed to prop Jamie
up into a sited position against the sink, scavenging the first aid kit to tend
to his mouth. She had preserved both of their modesties by placing a towel on
his lap, but their eyes were still disturbingly close as she worked. With a fluffy
clean towel, Claire dabbed the open wound, trying to ignore his bottomless blue
eyes, exuding love and pain enough to make her hands tremble. “How many
times?” Claire asked eventually, applying disinfectant on the wound. He
hissed in discomfort and she touched his forehead in gentleness. “How many
times did you kiss her?”“Just the once.” Jamie looked at the ceiling. Claire
bit her bottom lip, applying steri-strips to the wound – there wasn’t a suture
kit around, so it would have to do. “Why did you keep the photo?” Her fingertips
brushed the side of his cheek. “Of Mary?”“I have a tenderness for her.” He answered slowly,
searching her eyes. “Mary really was a good friend. But I kept it in case ye wanted
to see it – I think that most times imagining something is worse than truly knowing,
aye? I kept it so ye wouldna have to imagine.”“I see.” Claire glanced at him under her lashes.
“You told me you thought of never coming back. Why did you?”“I’m selfish,
Claire. I’m not brave enough not to see ye again. To touch ye, to kiss ye.” Jamie
whispered, tasting his admission and his own blood. “I’m not brave enough not
to want ye. And I’ve brought home hell for it.”

                            Fanfiction - Scalpel &amp; Needle II
                            I haven’t used many canon quotes in this story and that has been a conscient decision. I made an exception for this chapter. I hope this makes sense to some, as it made to me.Scalpel &amp; Needle(Arc I: Incision), PreviouslyScalpel &amp; Needle IIPart III - TethersSlowly but surely Jamie started to come undone. Claire had nonchalantly proposed that he took a few days to rest before going back to work at the Royal Infirmary, a dash of assertive-Chief-of-Surgery mixed with cool-but-concerned-girlfriend; undoubtedly the strains of a long trip, months of malnourishment and bone-deep tiredness called for a proper vacation. All those things were true, of course, but during that time Claire planned to watch him carefully for any signs of an impending meltdown. At first it had been a small thing here and there. Jamie had developed a furious distaste for any type of wasted food, becoming cranky and annoyed when some leftovers could still be found in the pan after their dinner. He ate with the frugality of a Tibetan monk, completely devoided of his previous enthusiastic enjoyment of food, managing to turn any meal into a tiresome task. Claire did her best to swallow every last crumb, even if it meant becoming indisposed afterwards and having to redouble her workouts.He had barely gained any weight back since his arrival. Jamie paraded around his flat in his old clothes, looking like a child wearing his father’s shirt. The sight caused Claire tremendous heartache, but Jamie had forbidden any attempts at spending money buying him new things. So, he went on, a walking allegory for a man whose life had ceased to fit altogether.When they went shopping together for supplies for their respective houses, he markedly pursed his lips anytime Claire grabbed for a slightly expensive hair conditioner or extravagant tropical produce. On more than one occasion, Claire had to bite the inside of her cheek and clench her teeth, counting to ten – or a hundred - inside her head, in lieu of bashing his head with a passion fruit. He was clearly troubled, yet uncapable of meeting his uncanny attitudes with proper words to explain himself. Jamie slept fitfully with the lights turned off, spending the majority of the night getting up from bed, where she pretended to sleep, to look through the window or wander across the living room, adjusting picture frames or reorganizing perfectly ordered books. One night, Claire simply left the soft corner lamp turned on, pretending to have forgotten it by accident, and he managed to sleep almost the entire night, smoothing somewhat the deep dark circles around his disturbed blue eyes. He toggled between meticulously avoiding any footage playing on the television relating to Syria and a fevered examination of newspapers and death counts. It was a duality that left her reeling, unsure about the right way to proceed around him. It seemed like a reluctant Adso had become his favourite interlocutor – possibly for the lack of any coherent response or human reproach – and Claire would sometimes hear the male surgeon in another division, speaking quietly in Gaelic to the unperturbed feline. But his dreams – his dreams talked when he couldn’t. After making love to Claire with a distance that made her feel unseen, avoiding her eyes even if his touches talked about utter tenderness and worship, he would retreat to a land where he could punish himself freely. The small noises he made were the shards of words, broken inside him and struggling to get out, bleeding him until his skin was dead cold. The night seemed to have too may hours and the room too many shadows, all of them for each to endure alone.The first time Jamie told her something significant about the past few months, he was inside the shower, his voice partially muffled by the running water. Claire was sitting on the toilet – it had been an imperative urgency, otherwise she wasn’t fond of sharing such intimacies – and he just started talking. “There was a wee lad there.” He said above the splatter of droplets and shampoo. “He must have been no older than three years. His whole family was already dead – sarin, I think. I bagged him for over two hours, because the last ventilator available was under a pile of rubble. My arms were so tired, Claire. So tired. I tried to keep going for as long as I could. Eventually I had to stop. I stopped, aye?”Claire had to put her closed fist inside her own mouth to stop herself from sobbing aloud. When she thought her voice might be steady enough, she whispered a gentle “But you tried. It wasn’t you fault, Jamie.”The next revelation came late one night, when she was doing dishes, the kitchen lights dim. Adso was sitting on the corner next to his new feeder, looking partially hypnotized by her movements, his eyes closing and opening like a traffic light. The female surgeon knew Jamie was standing behind her, looking at her intently, as if he could plant all those memories inside her head for her to examine, without the need for him to actually verbalize them.“There is no respect for civilian life there. No respect for life whatsoever.” He inhaled sharply. “The hospital got shelled quite a few times. One of those times I was in the middle of a surgery and refused to leave when they came to evacuate us. I took a bit of shrapnel.” That confirmed her suspicions about the scar under his shoulder blade. The glass she was scrubbing almost shattered under the force of her gripping hands. “It healed quickly enough.” A pause, just a little too long. There were moments I wished it didn’t.”Claire’s breath hitched on her throat. She forced herself to remain composed, a neutral detachment that would keep him talking. “Is this why you are punishing yourself?” She asked delicately. “Because you are alive?”“I’m not punishing myself.” Jamie retorted, his voice harsher than usual. Claire turned to face him, absorbedly cleaning her hands on the yellowish dish towel. For once, his eyes didn’t shy away from her. “Really? Because it surely looks like it from where I’m standing.” Her voice came out soft, in spite of her bluntness. “You refrain from eating, you do nothing that truly gives you pleasure.” Her hawk-like eyes studied him intently. “You’re acting like a ghost. Are you pretending to be dead until it actually happens?”Jamie clenched his jaw and Claire could have sworn she heard his teeth protesting. He breathed deeply – once, twice – and them most of the tension disappeared, leaving only his growing vulnerability. “My car could cover for a new ventilator.” He whispered, carefully looking around him, as if such thoughts had been a recurring occurrence. “The stereo on the living room – a few rounds of intravenous antibiotics. That jacket there – enough sterile compresses to pack a few until they reach surgery.” Jamie’s eyes searched hers, a despair so great it made her queasy. “How can I ken such things and go on living as I must?”“Your life didn’t cost them their own.” Claire tentatively reached for him, touching his forearm, where veins and tendons were visible under his skin. “It’s war, Jamie. It’s senseless. You aren’t killing them by allowing yourself a reprieve, or some small joy. You are not the butterfly causing the tornado on the other side of the world.”“I want to touch ye.” Jamie admitted, his voice unhinged. “But I feel so guilty, Claire. Every ounce of happiness seems like a crime committed against those I left there. Like I’ve started to forget them, just so I can live in peace.”Claire came around him, speechless, and hugged him from behind, her palms making sure his heart had truly come home inside his chest. They stayed there, swaying gently together – Jamie like an overbeaten tree crying to the skies and Claire his embracing wind, holding his branches in her soft breeze, her will the roots to keep him grounded. But none of those pieces he reluctantly shed could compare to the one they came upon, one brisk afternoon, looking at a few pictures on his phone. Jamie had been sharing with her images from a couple of surgeries he did overseas, names whispered with devotion and respect, when the screen suddenly showed a different reality.It was an innocent picture by all standards. He was still more of the man she remembered, with a kind of soft glow that always made her think of sunny days; the woman next to him was a brunette with gentle eyes, her face made prettier by the absolute kindliness that exuded from her smile. It reminded Claire of those sapient animals inhabiting ancient forests. His arm was loosely around her shoulders and they were smiling to the camera. “Who is she?” Claire asked calmly. Inside her a sense of profound direness grew, but she couldn’t afford to break just yet. Without truly knowing. “She is quite beautiful.”“Mary.” Jamie pronounced softly. Her name on his lips didn’t sound like an entire world, as Claire’s often did when he chose to address her so; it didn’t appear like a star he had just discovered and secretly named just for himself. Still, his quiet hesitancy gave her pause. “She is a nurse, went there with the Doctors Without Borders for a full year. She is a remarkable lass.”Claire swallowed hard – saliva, bile, unshed tears. Her index finger nervously rubbed his knuckle. “Tell me about her?”“Aye.” He nodded, closing his eyes. “I think I have to. We got along verra well, especially after we were both stationed in Raqqa. Mary was the only person I felt like I could talk to during those days. We leaned on each other.”“Did you - sleep with her?” Claire asked flatly. She felt very distant from her own body, as if her lips were being maneuvered by a ventriloquist. A very masochist one.   “No.” His eyes bore into hers, so she could take whatever she wanted from them. “But she did kiss me, Claire – and I let her.”It wasn’t the wave of anger she had expected. Claire didn’t think of slapping him, screaming, scratching his face or even getting up and leave. She simply sat there, feeling like a vacant space, void. Robbed.“Why?” She muttered. Her hands felt very empty and she suddenly craved the feel of a retractor and vascular clamp in her hands. “Were – are you in love with her?”“No.” Jamie brushed his slender face, sounding thoroughly broken. Claire didn’t dare to look for moistness on his cheeks. “It wasna like that. It had been a very hard week for us, the city was getting hit almost hourly. We were losing patients even before we had time to triage them. I didna even ken the names of the people I was treating – there was no time for gentleness or to feel anything, really. Just loss.” He stopped, covering his eyes with his palms. “With Mary I wanted to feel – kind. I wanted to feel kindness and be sure I still could. That I hadn’t died without even noticing it.”“Sometimes a kiss is just a kiss and sometimes a kiss is a tether to life.” Claire whispered, fidgeting with her fingers. Her eyes remained stubbornly dry. Everything felt dry, barren, desolated. “You told me that, once. Mary was your tether.” Not me.“I wanted to tell ye.” He promised in a hoarse voice. “But how can I tell you these things and expect ye to believe that I’ve never loved anyone but ye? How can I show ye how broken I am and beg ye to still want me?”“Is that the reason why you can’t look at me when you touch me? Or why you stopped calling me?” Claire asked with urgency, raising from the couch and pacing around the room. “Because you were ashamed?” She looked outside, to the fog covering Edinburgh like a cloak of cold quietness. It might have reached her heart. “I thought you were dead!” Her voice broke just a little on that final word. “Communications didn’t work most of the time.” Jamie assured her, pressing his hands together. “And when they eventually did – well, I thought it for the best that ye might presume me dead. I thought I might never come back, to expose ye to this wrecked thing I’ve become.” His breathing came out in a rasp. “I am sorry, Claire. For everything.”“Rationally, I can understand everything you are saying.” Claire murmured, crossing her arms against the sight of him. “But I can’t be here right now. I need to leave.”“Do as ye must.” Jamie looked at her with hooded eyes. Encouraging her to go, away away away from him.“I need to know one last thing. Please, Jamie, give me your honesty in this.” She grabbed her bag and walked towards the door of his house. “Would you have forgotten me in time?” Claire asked, her tone no more than a whisper in the growing shadows between them. Her hand was pressed against the doorknob until the metal almost marked her soft skin, erasing the lines of her palm.“That amount of time doesna exist.” Jamie answered, tears moistening his eyelashes, before she closed the door behind her.
