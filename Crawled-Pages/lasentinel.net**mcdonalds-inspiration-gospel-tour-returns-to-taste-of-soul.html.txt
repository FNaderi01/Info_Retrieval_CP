McDonald’s is bringing its Inspiration Celebration Gospel Tour to the 11th Annual Taste of Soul Family Festival on Saturday, October 15, 2016. Southern California McDonald’s will join local gospel choirs along with today’s biggest names in gospel music for a day of fellowship and fun for the community festival on Crenshaw Boulevard.
Hosting the tour is Stellar-nominated artist and radio personality Lonnie Hunter along with Christian comedienne Small Fire. Joining him on stage will be music director and songwriter Donald Lawrence along with legendary gospel singer Bishop Marvin Sapp, songwriter and vocal powerhouse Karen Clark-Sheard, award-winning Pastor Charles Jenkins, Christian rapping sensation Canton Jones, gospel crooner Jonathan McReynolds and famed Williams Brothers member Doug Williams. Stellar Award-winning artist Lonnie Hunter will once again resume hosting duties while Christian comedienne Small Fire brings laughter! The good times kick off at 10 am.

As with previous years, McDonald’s Inspiration Celebration Gospel Tour emphasizes the importance of serving and giving back to the community through its support of local Ronald McDonald House Charities® (RMHC)®Chapters. Concertgoers will have the opportunity to learn more about RMHC and the important role it plays in keeping families close to their sick child and the care and resources they need, here in their local community – and worldwide.
The nationwide tour kicked off May 25 and culminates through October 15, making stops in Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago, Detroit, Greensboro, Houston, Jackson, Los Angeles, Memphis, Philadelphia, Raleigh, St. Louis and Washington, D.C. McDonald’s Inspiration Celebration Gospel Tour is an extension of the brand’s 365Black platform, an initiative that celebrates the pride, heritage, and achievements of African-Americans year round. Dr Pepper® also returns as a tour sponsor, showing its appreciation and commitment to the African-American community.
