WHE Learning Strategy
A learning strategy to create a ready, willing and able workforce – a workforce of excellence – for health emergency work
Overview
Since its establishment in mid-2016, the WHO Health
Emergencies Programme (WHE) has radically reformed the way
the Organization works in emergencies. This new way of working has highlighted gaps in competencies of existing personnel
and the urgent need to prepare an adequate surge capacity for
emergency work. The creation of a workforce of excellence, to
which this strategy contributes directly, is critical to achieving
the ambitious target of the Organization’s General Programme
of Work for 2019–2023 (GPW13), and in particular to ensure 1
billion people are better protected from health emergencies.
