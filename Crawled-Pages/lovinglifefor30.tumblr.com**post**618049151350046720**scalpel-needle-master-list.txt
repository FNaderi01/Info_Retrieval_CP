On an airplane in February 2018, I started writing what I thought would be a four-part story. In the story, Jamie and Claire were already in an established relationship. My four-part plan rapidly turned into a six-part plan, then an eight-part idea, and eventually finished as an eleven-part story. As I posted, the story started to spin off into a series of ficlets. You can read this story chronologically as listed below or you can start with the eleven-part original story that begins in November 2016. 2016 - A series of firsts (meeting, date, I love you, loss, weekend holiday, moving day, fight, Christmas)APRIL: Three Times Jamie Fraser Did Not Get Claire Beauchamp’s Number, And The One Time He Did, Retelling 1.0 (retelling of Three Times from Jamie’s POV) | MAY: Barrier, Bookcases, Not the First Date | JUNE: More, Boyfriend, Cats, Girlfriend | JULY: Afghanistan, Blade of Grass, Clouds, Treehouse | SEPTEMBER: Glasgow | OCTOBER: 2:00 a.m. | DECEMBER: Moving Day, Alexa, The First Noël 2017 - Growing together (bumps, healing)JANUARY: Finish | MAY: May 1, 2017 | JUNE: Words | JULY: Bastille Day | AUGUST: Spain, Pearls | OCTOBER: October 20, 2017, Sick Day | NOVEMBER-DECEMBER: Loss Act I [eleven-part series that was written before anything else in this universe] – Part One, Part Two, Part Three, Part Four, Part Five, Part Six, Part Seven, Part Eight, Part Nine, Part Ten, Part Eleven2018 - Making a life (a dog, a cottage, a wedding, an injury)JANUARY: Bathtub | MARCH: Canis Familiaris | APRIL: Shed, Five Ways Jamie Fraser and Claire Beauchamp Break In Their New Home: an in-progress series of five smutty one-shots of how Jamie and Claire break in their new home – 1.0: Stairs, 2.0: Windowsill, 3.0: Washing Machine | MAY: Handfasting, Surname | JUNE: &amp; forever | OCTOBER: October 20, 2018: a completed two-part ficlet about Claire’s thirty-sixth birthday - Part One, Part Two | NOVEMBER 2018 [and through March 2019]: Loss Act II [twenty-seven part hurt/comfort arc] - Part One, Part Two , Part Three, Part Four,Part Five, Part Six, Part Seven, Part Eight,Part Nine, Part Ten, Part Eleven, Part Twelve,Part Thirteen, Part Fourteen, Part Fifteen, Part Sixteen, Part Seventeen, Part Eighteen, Part Nineteen, Part Twenty | Part Twenty-One, Part Twenty-Two, Part Twenty-Three, Part Twenty-Four, Part Twenty-Five, Part Twenty-Six, Part Twenty-Seven2019 - Rebounding (charting a new playfulness, life)JUNE: 180 Seconds | JULY: Toys, Carte Blanche | SEPTEMBER: Announcement | NOVEMBER: Negotiations | DECEMBER: CharlieCurrent as of January 5, 2020 | Updated masterlist available heremoodboard by @balfeheughlywed​

And now here we are, roughly 250k words later. I love this universe for so many reasons, many of which involve the folks in this community who this story has helped me meet. Thanks to everyone who has ever liked, reblogged, messaged me, or sent out cosmic good vibes over this story. I love it (AND YOU) with all of my heart. 💜There are some folks who have been so ride or die with this story, and I owe them a whole lot. For those of you who have made me laugh out loud, cry, smirk, or get mooshy over a comment or a bit of re-read commentary (looking at you @walkinginland), thank you.To @kkruml, @abreathofsnowandwaffles, @balfeheughlywed, @notevenjokingfic, and @kalendraashtar - thank you all for always believing in me with this story. All five of you have done so much heavy beta lifting on this tale, and I’m forever indebted to you for all of it. Thanks for always giving it to me straight, telling me when I can do better, and knowing these characters and their stories as well as I do. Does two years make this story officially a toddler? Can’t wait to see what the Terrible Twos bring J+C in the Loss-verse. xx.
