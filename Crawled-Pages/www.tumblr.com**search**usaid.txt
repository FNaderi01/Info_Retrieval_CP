Wait..isn‚Äôt that kinda like USAID (U.S. Agency for International Development), a billion-dollar ‚Äúhumanitarian‚Äù agency, creating a secret Cuban social network for the explicit purpose of causing unrest &amp; destabilizing the Cuban government in 2010? Hmm..interesting ü§î

Around the world, the @StateDept and @USAID are leading efforts to fight disease, feed the hungry, and reduce instability, all of which makes us safer here at home. As we bring attention to the work that so many Americans are doing to help others around the world during #AmericanHeroesWeek, today we are spotlighting Tim Callaghan. Tim, the Senior Regional Advisor for Latin America and the Caribbean for USAID‚Äôs Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance, has served as team leader for many of USAID‚Äôs disaster responses including Hurricane Matthew and the Ebola outbreak. Here, Tim provides water containers and kitchen sets to a mother and daughter who were affected by the #Ecuador earthquake.Ôªø
