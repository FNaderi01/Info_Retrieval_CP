Early life, education and private career[edit]
Huizenga, born to a family of Dutch Americans, is the current co-owner and operator of Huizenga Gravel Company, a third generation business located in Jenison, Michigan. He has been affiliated with it for most of his life.
In the early 1990s, Huizenga obtained his Michigan Real Estate sales license, and he quickly became one of the most successful realtors in southwest Michigan. He left real estate in 1996 when he was recruited by U.S. Representative Pete Hoekstra to be his Director of Public Policy. For six years, from 1996 through 2002, he traveled throughout western Michigan becoming familiar with the various towns and cities, and eventually decided to run for political office.
Michigan House of Representatives[edit]
Starting with his first election in 2002, Huizenga represented the 90th district for three terms, by winning reelection in 2004 and 2006. After the 2006 election he was term limited. The district is located in Ottawa County and includes the cities of Holland, Zeeland, Hudsonville, and the four townships of Blendon Township, Jamestown Township, Holland Township, and Zeeland Township.
Huizenga voted for the initial version of the Michigan Business Tax, but opposed the 22% surcharge and a sales and services tax later in the process.[2]

Elections[edit]
2010
See also: 2010 United States House of Representatives elections in Michigan § District 2
Huizenga is the U.S. Representative for Michigan's 2nd congressional district, defeating Democratic nominee Fred Johnson in the general election. 64% of the ballots were cast for Huizenga, and 32% were cast for Johnson.[3]
The district is rated "Solid Republican" by The New York Times,[4] and simply marked as an "Open Seat" according to The Washington Post.[5]
This district and its predecessors have been in Republican hands without interruption since 1935, and only four Democrats have ever represented it since its creation in 1873.[citation needed]
After serving 18 years, Republican incumbent Peter Hoekstra retired to run for the Republican nomination in the 2010 Michigan Gubernatorial race.  Huizenga defeated Jay Riemersma, State Senator Wayne Kuipers, businessman Bill Cooper, and three others in the Republican primary election—the real contest in this heavily Republican district—on August 3, 2010.[6]
2012
See also: 2012 United States House of Representatives elections in Michigan § District 2
In 2012, Huizenga was reelected to the U.S. House, defeating Willie German Jr. of the Democratic Party, Mary Buzuma of the Libertarian Party, Ronald Graeser of the U.S. Taxpayers Party and William Opalicky of the Green Party.[citation needed]
He is a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership.[7]
