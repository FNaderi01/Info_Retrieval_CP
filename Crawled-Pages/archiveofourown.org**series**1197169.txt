    Summary
      The dorm has since acquired the presence of one Andrew Minyard, who appears to be keeping himself cool by working his way through a pint of ice cream. Without even turning his head, Andrew comments, “I don’t think I’ve ever seen you put gas in that car”“And I don’t think I’ve ever seen you put ice cream in that freezer, but somehow you’re still eating it” Pointedly, Neil makes his way over to the kitchen and unloads the handful of cartons he’d picked up on the way home. Andrew doesn’t dignify this with a response, and Neil gets lost in the ice cold air of the freezer for a few moments too long before he realises the tell tale scraping of a spoon against plastic has stopped. When he turns, Andrew is watching him with a completely blank expression. In Andrew-speak, this tended to mean he was trying especially hard to conceal whatever was going on behind it. Neil raises a brow in question.“Those are…shorts” Andrew says, and Neil sees it when Andrew hears his own words back, watches the imperceptible tightening of his jaw and the twitch of his brows.“Yes,” and Neil is trying very hard not to look happy about it, “they’re new”

    Summary
      “Take his helmet off” Aaron instructs, when Andrew clearly isn’t responding. Neil hesitates. Part of him knows he has to, that its a necessary evil. The other part of him doesn’t want to do it without knowing that Andrew is cognizant enough to recognise Neil’s touch. He shucks off his gloves and unsnaps his wrist-guards first, careful to unclip Andrew’s helmet with a delicacy not often afforded on the court and slips it off slowly enough that he feels it right in his chest when Andrew’s head lolls back against the cold floor. “Someone get his jersey out of the way, the bastard got him in the stomach”“No” Neil snarls, not recognising his own voice.Aaron reaches forward and Neil smacks his arm away. “Josten, will you fucking-”“Neil”
