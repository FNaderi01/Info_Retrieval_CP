    Summary
      “Evidently, there are a number of differences between your dimension and my own," Tom Marvolo Riddle said, before backing away from the Death Eater and thoroughly shattering everything Harry Potter thought he knew.(In another dimension, Tom Riddle and Harry Potter grow up together. It makes all the difference.)

    Summary
      Voices have a lot of power, but in Amity Park they're being silenced. When teenagers start disappearing from the most haunted town in America, with no ghost taking credit for the crime, Team Phantom begins to wonder if their enemy is a ghost or a human. With their lives on the line, Danny realizes he's not the only one sacrificing everything he can to get them home. It's a bit difficult to be the hero when you're one of the victims.

    Summary
      Naruto always thought the world looked a little weird. Sasuke always knew his family was a little off. (Reincarnation is complicated and maybe Asura and Indra should have thought this through a bit more.)

  Summary
    "This world never gave Tom Riddle the orphan a chance, and I’m not entirely certain myself if he deserved one, but Tom, I may look at you and wonder what could have been, but I also see the glaring, fundamental difference between you and Voldemort that is solely your own to claim. Voldemort always had the opportunity to change, to learn, to grow, to understand that in which he could not experience naturally. For him to choose a different path would have been the hardest journey I can ever imagine someone taking." "But," Dumbledore continued, ignoring Tom's pinched expression, "understand that the Voldemort of this world was given the chance. I only wonder how many times he denied it."

    Summary
      After the disaster at the Department of Mysteries, Harry just wants to be left alone. But between dealing with the Dursleys and struggling with his own depression, the Ministry soon comes knocking with a request to give his testimony. Harry’s all for condemning his enemies for the rest of eternity, right up until he steps into the courtroom and realizes he’s more tired than angry and vengeance has never been his thing anyway, especially when he spots even arrogant Draco Malfoy sitting in the stands, grey-faced and blank and staring at his father as if the man would disappear if he so much as blinks. Besides, the world’s going to hell, and logically speaking, less people wanting to stab him in the back just makes his life easier in the long run.  Of course, little does Harry know, with that one decision, everything changes.
