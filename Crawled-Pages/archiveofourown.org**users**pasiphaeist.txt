  Summary
    Nico di Angelo and Percy Jackson – also known as The Cousins in the organised crime scene of San Francisco – work as professional killers. While Nico has a thing for knives and gore, Percy is more of a quick and clean type, his passion being guns of all sorts. They are good at what they do, and they are good together.
