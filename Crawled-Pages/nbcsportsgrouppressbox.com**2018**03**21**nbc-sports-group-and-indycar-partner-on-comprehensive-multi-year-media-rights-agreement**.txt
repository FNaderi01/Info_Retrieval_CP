STAMFORD, Conn. ‚Äì March 21, 2018 ‚Äì NBC Sports Group and INDYCAR announced a new, multi-year media rights agreement today in which NBC Sports has acquired the rights to present all INDYCAR races, qualifying, practices, and Indy Lights races across its platforms beginning in 2019.

The Indianapolis 500 and seven additional Verizon IndyCar Series races will be broadcast annually on NBC, with all remaining races televised on NBCSN. All races will be live streamed to authenticated subscribers on NBCSports.com and the NBC Sports app. Details of NBC Sports‚Äô 2019 INDYCAR schedule will be announced at a later date.
NBC Sports Gold ‚Äì NBC Sports Group‚Äôs direct-to-consumer product ‚Äì will offer a package to INDYCAR fans that features all qualifying and practices not televised live, all Indy Lights races, and full-event replays. Additional details, including the cost of the Gold offering, will be announced at a later date.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre excited to have NBC Sports serve as the exclusive home of INDYCAR, which represents the most competitive open-wheel racing in the world,‚Äù said Jon Miller, President, Programming, NBC Sports and NBCSN. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre honored to bring the Indianapolis 500, one of the most prestigious events in all of sports, to NBC, further enhancing NBC Sports‚Äô Championship Season. We‚Äôve seen consistent growth for INDYCAR on NBCSN in the past decade, and we hope to continue that growth throughout the series by leveraging the television, digital, production and marketing assets that make NBC Sports a powerful media partner.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis arrangement brings all of INDYCAR to one home, increases our exposure and includes our first direct-to-consumer offer for our fans,‚Äù said Mark Miles, CEO of Hulman &amp; Company, which owns INDYCAR and Indianapolis Motor Speedway. ‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt be happier to have start-to-finish coverage of INDYCAR‚Äôs season with the NBC Sports Group.‚Äù
The 103rd Running of the Indianapolis 500, set for Sunday, May 26, 2019, will be the first ever on NBC.
