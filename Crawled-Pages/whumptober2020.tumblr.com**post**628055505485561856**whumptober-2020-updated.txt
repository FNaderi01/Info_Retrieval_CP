There are 31 Official themes this year - one for each day of the month - which can be used, skipped, or combined in any way you‚Äôd like. They are meant to serve as inspiration without being taken literally (e.g. you don‚Äôt have to include the exact wording into your work). Additionally, there are 3 prompts for each theme. ¬†These are optional suggestions and can be used in conjunction with the theme, or as options/alternatives. ¬†We want to give everyone as much creative freedom as possible, as well as increase event accessibility for folks with triggers and squicks.Creators can PRODUCE work in any media they choose, including but not limited to: writing, visual artwork, and photo/video/audio edits. Creators can PARTICIPATE as much or as little as they want (i.e. you don‚Äôt have to do ALL the prompts if you don‚Äôt want to) and prompts can be used in any order. They are also free to use even after the event ends.When uploading Whumptober content to your blog, be sure to tag the with:#whumptober2020 ‚Ä¶..(the event tag)#no.1, #no.2, #no.3, ‚Ä¶..(theme number) #bruised, #stabbed, ¬†‚Ä¶..(the theme or specific prompt you chose)#fandom or #OC#medium ‚Ä¶..(gifs, fic, podcast, art, etc.)#teeth, #etc ‚Ä¶..(trigger warnings &amp; any additional tags. Keep in mind not to add ‚Äútw‚Äù in front but only use the word/trigger itself, because tumblr sucks)#nsfw, #nsfwhump ‚Ä¶..(only for nsfw content)PLEASE BE DILIGENT WITH YOUR TAGGING. Only properly tagged posts are considered for archiving on the official @whumptober2020‚Äã blog. They must be tagged in the order above.Unfortunately, due to the sheer number of participants in recent years, we cannot guarantee your work will be archived. A random selection of properly tagged posts from all genres will be reblogged each day.Whumpers who produce content for 31 total theme days are considered event completionists and will be tagged in a masterpost at the end of the month.Questions not addressed below can be directed to this blog as well.Thanks for reading, and happy whumping!Frequently Asked QuestionsQ. What kind of content can I make? Can it be NSFW?This is a MIXED MEDIA event! You can write fic, post meta, doodle or paint, create a gif set or photo edit, link a song, or get crafty with video - anything goes. As for NSFW, make what you like, we just hope that you‚Äôll tag your work accordingly so that others participating in the event can stay safe :)Q. Do I have to do all 31 Days? Can I post early/late?Participate as much or little as you like, and post whenever! Just be sure to tag your posts properly (ex. #no.11, #psych101). Combining prompts into one piece of work is okay, and posting late is as well so as long as it‚Äôs in October.Q. What if I don‚Äôt understand a theme?Send us an ask! We‚Äôre happy to help clarify. That said, the themes are entirely up for interpretation :)Q. Can I combine Whumptober with other creation challenges?Absolutely! That‚Äôs like shooting two whumpees with one bullet :)Q. Can I upload/repost my whumptober content to other social media platforms?Of course! We‚Äôve created an AO3 Collection to archive any fics posted there. The archive can be accessed here. The blog is the official archive, so please respect the boundaries of any closeted whumpers in your social circle :)Q. Can I use prompts to write a new chapter for an existing fic?YesQ. An existing fic I am currently writing contains many of the Whumptober prompts, can I use it?If you are actively writing this fic at the moment with the whumptober prompts in mind, yes. If it just conveniently checks the boxes, then please don‚Äôt. You can, however, add new chapters answering one or more of the prompts.Q. What kind of characters can I write for? Fandom characters, OC characters, human, furry, alien, cyborg, whoever you like. Q. Can I use a prompt multiple times? Yes, ¬†but it only counts onceQ. If I‚Äôm not comfortable with one day‚Äôs prompts can I use a prompt of a different day as a substitute and still be a completionist? Yes, but please do not use a specific prompt twice. We have also created an alternate prompts list that you can draw from [here].Q. Where can I post my work? Post where and how you want. You don‚Äôt even have to (cross)post it to Tumblr. Just keep in mind if it‚Äôs not on Tumblr we will not be able to add it to the blog archive.Q. Can I start posting early?You can, but this is an October event and wouldn‚Äôt it be more fun with everyone doing it at the same time? That being said, you can post early, but we won‚Äôt be reblogging any work predating October 1st. Q. Do I have to finish a fic I started/can I post WIP‚Äôs.?Yes you can post WIPs. And you‚Äôre not obligated to finish it in October for it to count towards being a completionist. ¬†Q. Is co-writing allowed?Yes, absolutely, and it would count towards being a completionist for both/all of you :)Q. Do I have to create 31 standalone pieces to be considered a completionist or can I write one continuous story?One continuous story is fine. ¬†The challenge is to write something for 31 prompts. If that‚Äôs spread over 31 fics or just one, you are still considered a completionist. (The same goes for every other media you choose.)Q. Is there a min/max limit on word count?There is no limitQ. Can I combine prompts? Is there a limit on how many? No limit and combine as many as you‚Äôd like.Q. Is a hc/angst focus ok?Of course!Q. What‚Äôs considered nsfw?See this postQ. What‚Äôs whump?See this postQ. My interpretation of the prompt isn‚Äôt whumpy at all, does that count?No, sorry, but keep in mind that whump [see definition] is something very nuanced and different for everyone and emotional whump/angst is just as much part of it, as is physical whump and torture. So before you dismiss your idea, think about this.Q. Can I start working on the prompts before October?Absolutely! That‚Äôs why we posted the prompts a month in advance. We recognise how difficult it can be creating for 31 days in ‚Äúreal time‚Äù.Q. How do I tag triggers?tw at the end of the word, ex. emeto twQ. Do I have to use your tags?Yes, if you want your work archived on the blog. If not, feel free to use whatever tags you want. ¬†Q. Does combining prompts count towards completion?YesQ. Can we @ you?Yes but we mostly rely on the whumptober2020 tagQ. Is there anything we are absolutely not allowed to write?There are no rules, just be sure to properly tag your trigger warnings. And keep in mind Tumblr‚Äôs policies if you are posting it here (or the policies of whatever site you use). Q. Where can I go for brainstorming help?Here on DiscordQ. My characters are minors, is that ok? Yes, but as with everything else, tags are your best friend. Q. Can I cross post on other blogs?Yes, multiple platforms and blogs are perfectly acceptable. You can also post different works to different accounts under different names, without posting them everywhere at once. Note: This is a creation challenge, please don‚Äôt repost your old work under our tags (unless it‚Äôs been changed or edited for the event).
