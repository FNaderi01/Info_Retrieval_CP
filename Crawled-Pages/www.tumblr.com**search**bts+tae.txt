            BTS Reaction-They Call You Clingy        Originally posted by bwiseoksJinEvery day when you wake up you decide to make Jin lunch. Since the comeback was in full swing you know he doesn’t take care of himself like he should. That means he skips out on meals often when it’s practice days. It didn’t bother you to make him lunch though, anything you could do to help him made you happy. So, you put everything into a bag and then headed off towards BigHit. You visited so often the security knew you by name and happily let you in and you followed the sound of loud music playing.You snuck inside quietly and set your bag on the table watching the boys all dance in unison. After the song ended you clapped and whistled for them, and they all turned and smiled brightly at you. Their choreographer telling them to take five. “Hey guys, I brought some HEALTHY snacks for you all!” you said pulling everything out of your bag. The rest of the boys happily digged into everything you brought. You smiled turning towards Jin, but he wasn’t his happy smiling self like he usually was when you stopped by, so what makes Jin happy? Food of course. “I made you your favorite!” you said pulling it out and holding it in front of him.“Why are you here Y/n.” You frowned slightly tilting your head to the side “You know we’re busy with the comeback. You just a distraction.” he grumbled reluctantly taking the lunch box from you. He sat down and started eating the food you had made for him, you wondered if maybe he was having a touch day so you wrapped your arms around his shoulders and resting your head on his shoulders. You could literally feel the tension within his body, you pressed a gentle kiss to his cheek.“You doing amazing Jinnie, I promise.” He groaned shrugging him off his shoulders “God why do you have to be so clingy!” he groaned softly not wanting the other boys to see. “Don’t you have anything better to do than come here?” he asked harshly. You felt tears threaten to spill down your cheeks but you bite down on your lip and lifted up your bag throwing it over your shoulder.“Actually I do have something better to do than be yelled at by you,” you replied before turning on your heels and running out of the building. You didn’t know where you were going, but you weren’t going to go home and sit around and wait until Jin came home and yelled at you some more. So you walked down the streets of Seoul until something interesting came up. However the most interesting you found was a bar, and seeing as you had nothing else to do you went in and started downing shots after shots.“Because I care too much he wants me to leave him alone!? Who doesn’t like being babied!” you slurred to the bartender, extremely overly drunk, the bartender had decided to stop serving you as you could hardly hold your own head up. “He’s lucky I put up with his his his shit,” you said trying to find the words to explain how you felt. Your phone seemed to ring for the seventh time that night and you picked up the phone seeing it was Jin again. “Probably going to yell at me for coddling him again!” you complained dropping the phone, but the bartender lifted it up and answered “YAH!” before giving it back to you.“Y/N-AH WHERE ARE YOU!” Jin shouted getting you head to pound, “I can home for dinner and cuddles and you were nowhere to be seen,” he whined. You rolled your eyes before bringing the phone to your mouth so you could talk.“I didn’t want to be clingy!” you replied tears welling in your eyes “So I thought I’d give-” you hiccuped “You the night off by hanging out with….” you looked at the bar tender “Whom are you again?” you questioned getting him to roll his eyes and walk off. “Well I don’t know but he’s really good at making vodka drinks,” you replied. He sighed and you did the same exaggerated sigh “Just have a relaxing night without your clingy girlfriend.” you told him before hanging up. “Ya know I really ought to break up with him.” you mumbled dropping your head on the table.The next thing you knew you woke up with Jin’s strong arms around you as he carried you down the streets. You lifted your head and gave him a questioning look, wondering how he found you and why he did. He sighed “I’m sorry for calling you clingy Jagi, I love that you make sure I eat, and give me endless cuddles and rubs after practice, I was just having a bad practice and I couldn’t do anything right and I felt like I didn’t deserve you,” he mumbled before kissing your head. You sighed plopping you head back against his shoulder.“You don’t, but unfortunately you are stuck with me.”Originally posted by imonaworldtourYoongi“Yoooooonnnggii!” you whined walking over to him pulling his chair so he was no longer in front of his desk. He sighed rolling his eyes before spinning around to look at you “You need to take a break!” you complained climbing into his lap. He groaned once again but you buried your face in his neck wrapping your arms around him. “I’ve barely seen you all week, and I need some cuddles,” you mumbled into his neck. He sighed letting you sit in his lap for a while, but his fingers were tapping a beat and muttering lyrics under his breath.Sighing you pulled your head back to glare at him and he tilted his head to the side as if to say ‘what?’. You huffed and climbed off his lap before turning him back towards his desk and pushing him back in. “Fine, if you rather work than cuddle with your girlfriend, be my guest!” you said crossing your arms over your chest. Hoping that throwing a little tantrum would guilt him into cuddling you. “God, why do you have to be so needy?” he grumbled pulling his head phones back over his ears, you rolled your eyes and walked out of the studio slamming the door shut. Tears rolled down your cheeks, you made your way back to your shared house and changed into you pajama’s that felt new because you usually sleep in Yoongi’s clothes but you were hurt by his words and you didn’t want to be so clingy anymore. You collected the covers out of the guest room and set yourself up in the living room.Chips, cookies, and sparkling drinks and curled up in a blanket. You turned on your favorite Kdrama. Yoongi came home around three in the morning and when he saw you on the couch he rolled his eyes and then went into the bedroom probably to sleep like he usually does. Most of the time he wakes you up by curling around you and you happily take him into your arms and cuddle him until his hearts content. But not wanting to be clingy you decided you were going to sleep on the couch tonight. It was at least an hour and you were nearly alseep when a dead tired Yoongi kicked your foot.You opened your eyes and furrowed your eyebrows “What do you want dick?” you grumbled before getting comfrotable again closing you eyes. He huffed before sitting down next to you and poking your face, you opened on eye at him “I’m trying to sleep,” you told him. He jutted out his lower lip and you closed your eyes wrapping you arms around yourself “And I didn’t want to be so needy.” As soon as the words left you lips he lifted you and the covers over his shoulder and ttrudged back into the bedroom throwing you down.He then lifted the covers up and slide in beside you, before burying his face in your neck, his arm around your torso, his legs twisted with his. “I’m… sorry…” his lips feathered over your neck, he nuzzled closer in hopes you would run your fingers through his hair like you always did to help him sleep. “I love your snuggles, cuddles and hugs. I was a dick, you were right, forgive me?” you rolled you eyes at how easily soft Yoongi could get you to forgive him. Your fingers ran through his hair, and he hummed content “I love you Jagi,” he whispered pressing a kiss to your neck. “I love you too.”Originally posted by apgujeonHoseokHobi had convinced you to come to the BTS party with him, even though you only have met the boys once and the rest of the people would be absolute strangers. The only reason you agreed was because you would get to spend time with your boyfriend who’s been awfully busy with the comeback lately. So when you got there, you refused to let go of his hand, which at first he didn’t mind, in fact he showed you off to literally everyone. Showering you in complements, making other people agree to how beautiful you looked in your party dress. You seemingly relaxed into the night knowing Hobi had your back.He finally got pulled away from you when a dance battle broke out between the dance line for the crown of best dancer in the band. You didn’t mind though because he wasn’t too far away and you were having a lovely conversation with one of the make up artists. However by the end of your conversation she was stolen away and for the first time that night you were left completely alone in a room full of unfamilair faces. Feeling a bit uneasy you searched around for your boyfriend. You found him with the rest of the boys by the bar and quickly made your way over to him.You could tell they were all a little tipsy when you took your seat next to Hobi, and it actually took a while for Hoseok to even realize you had taken a seat next to him. “Why are you sitting here? I thought you were making friends?” he questioned or slurred, it was a little bit of the two. You shrugged lacing your fingers through his holding his hand once again. All the boys started leaving and Hobi sighed watching them go before looking over at you “Why do you have to be so clingy to me? I brought you here to make friends, not follow me like a puppy,” he said letting go of your hand. He then asked the bar tender for another shot and you slowly lifted yourself off the chair.“Okay then,” you said giving him a smile before walking over to the boys, you looked between the six of them and found Namjoon to be the most sober meaning he was in charge of getting the boys home. You tugged on his arm and he looked at you “Make sure Hobi gets home safe, yea?” you asked with a smile. He nodded sadly at you not expecting you to tell him why Hobi was no longer go home with you. “Thanks,” you whispered before making your way out of the building. Slowly the tears rolled down your cheeks as you trudged your way back to your arpartment. The words that rolled off Hoseok’s tongue were very hurtful to you as you always thought the two of you were equally clingy to each other.You went into your empty apartment and continued to ponder his words, maybe he was right, you moved to Seoul to be with him, and hadn’t really made any friends, you mostly just stick with him. That must be annoying to have to deal with you 24/7, so you decided right then and there that you were going to give Hobi some space. You would cut down on the constant flow of texts and calls, visit the dorm less often and just focus on settling into Seoul. However, two days later you wouldn’t realise how lonesome you’d be for your little ball of sunshine. There was a knock on your door and you lazily made your way to the door and then pulled it open to find your boyfriend. Standing there looking at his feet, you crossed your arms over your chest “Would you like to come in?” you questioned. He nodded softly and you stepped out of the way so he could step inside. “To what do I owe the surpise visit?” you questioned walking over to your couch sitting down staring at him. He walked over and sat down next to you and finally looked up at you.“I’ve missed you Jagi,” he mumbled looking sorry, “I tried to figure out why you were so distant from me but Namjoon helped me figure it out.” he sighed before wrapping you up in his arms “You’re not clingy and I don’t like spending more then three hours apart. I’m sorry for what I said, please don’t banish me from seeing your beauitufl face anymore!” he whined pressing kisses all over your face getting you to break out into a giggle. “Ugh, I’ve miss you so much Jagi,” he mumbled pulling you closer.“I missed you too,” you whispered before cuddling into him “Don’t be so cuddly if you don’t want me to be clingy,” you teased wrapping your legs around him. You looked up at him and he smiled down at you before pressing a soft kiss to your lips.Originally posted by rapdaeguNamjoonWith the comeback on the horizon Namjoon was more stressed than ever, being the leader he feels it’s his job to make sure everyone is in their places. He’s constantly working on things, tweaking others, and it’s almost like he doesn’t have a moment to even sleep. You being the caring girlfriend you were started to worry about him, it couldn’t be healthy what he was doing and if there was anyone he would listen to it was you. You walked into BigHit with a bright smile trying to find the best way to lure Joonie away from his work.Knowing full well Joon wouldn’t just come with you for himself, you decided to make it seemed like he was doing it for you. You got in the practice room to see 4/7 sleeping on the floor, Hobi and Jimin dancing, and Namjoon talking with the managers. You smiled and offered a small wave to the two dancing boys who smiled back and waited patiently for your boyfriend to stop talking with his managers. However, even from this far away you could tell he was getting frustrated. Eventually the rest of them walked away and you skipped over wrapping your arms around your tense boyfriend, pulling him into a back hug.“You work so hard Joonie, Armys will be very pleased,” you said holding him for a while in hopes to relieve some tension. You then walk around to stand in front of him, smiling your brightest smile at him. “You need a break Joonie, why don’t we go out to eat?” you offered as he continued to look behind you at the papers on the table. “Hey,” you whined taking his face and forcing him to look you in the eyes “Just fifteen minutes that’s all I’m asking for… I miss you.” you said giving him your best pout wrapping your arms around his neck. He sighed pulling your arms off of him, rolling his eyes, “I don’t have fifteen minutes to give you,” he replied before going back to the papers, but this time you sat on top of them crossing your arms over your chest. He glared at you for a moment, before running his fingers through his hair shifting his weight from one foot to another “Why do you have to be so needy? God, just go do something else,” he said harshly pulling you off the table gently and turning you towards the door. Hobi and Jimin looked at you concerned, knowing what Joon had said wasn’t exactly nice. But you bite back the tears before turning around tapping him on the shoulder, “What now!?” he turned around. “I wanted to apologize for being so ‘needy” you said using your fingers for air quotes around needy. You shook your head “i’m sorry for being annoying when I want to talk to you, but the sound of your voice calms all my anxieties. I’m Sorry I’m needy because I miss you when I haven’t seen you in days, and if I do it’s only quick in the morning and when we go to sleep at night. I’m sorry for getting emotional because I care about you and I know you’re not taking care of yourself like you should be. I love you, and I am so, so, SO sorry for making your life harder because of that.” You turn around on your heels and make your way towards the door.As soon as you pull it open you stop when Joon’s voice starts “I’d like to go to lunch with you,” he said as you looked over your shoulder at him. You could tell he felt bad for snapping at you, “If the offer still stands… that is,” he said softly. You rolled your eyes not believing the things his man did to your heart. “Well come on then.” He quickly dashed away from the table and over to you, wrapping an arm around you as the two of you left the BigHit company. “You’re lucky I love you,” you mumbled knowing you pretty much just let him off the hook. He smiled and pulled you closer to his chest pressing a kiss to the top of your head. “Thank you… you know for everything… I love you.” he whispered into your head and you smiled slightly leaning into him, happy to have him for even a few moments.Originally posted by yoonkminJiminIt had been nearly two days since you had last seen your boyfriend, he comes home way late at night and leaves before you even wake up. To say you were missing him was an understatement, but you knew today was the one day they’d get to rest up and Jimin was still fast asleep in bed. You on the other had woken up hours ago and cleaned the house and then started making breakfast for him. You had the whole day planned out for the two of you. You’d make him breakfast, and then cuddle on the sofa, then maybe a full body massage. You were going to spoil him rotten because that boy deserves it for how hard he works, but it also means you get to spend the day with him. You heard the shower running and knew he was up. You quickly set the table full of a breakfast feast. You heard him tumbling down the stairs and turned smiling at him. But that smile quickly faded as you saw him dressed in his usual dance outfit and a duffle bag over his shoulder busily messaging on his phone. You pouted and made your way over to him.Gently you pushed his phone out of his face before wrapping your arms around his neck getting him to focus on you. It had been a while since you got to be this close to your boyfriend and you missed him terribly. He looked tired, exhausted really, like he hadn’t slept properly in weeks, or even eaten properly. “Where are you going?” you asked with a slight frown on your lip, it was obvious to the both of you where he was going to go. “Hoseok hyung and I were going to get some more practice in.”You frowned tightening your arms around him burying your face through his neck. “But you’ve haven’t had a day off in weeks Chim, you need to take care of yourself!” you said pressing a kiss to his neck getting him to giggle. You pull away and smile brightly at him “And I miss you so much, please spend the day with me,” you whined. He sighed trying to take your arms off him but you wouldn’t budge “Please?” you questioned once again. He rolled his eyes this time pulling you off of him before heading towards the door.“We only have a few weeks left until comeback and I need to be ready, everyone is already disappointed the abs won’t be making a comeback so my dancing needs to outshine that, it’s what I’m most important for anyways!” he sighed  “You know how important it is to me, to the boys, to the army? When did you get so needy?” he snapped before walking out the door slamming it behind himself. You jumped slightly at the sound of the slamming door before a sad feeling washed over you. You sniffled before walking back over to the table and putting away the breakfast you had worked so hard on. Then walking into the living room to put away all the massage oils you had just bought. You sat on the couch and wiped off the tears before checking your phone to see Jimin’s bright face smiling at you, even though you were upset at him, the picture brought a smile out of your lips. You debated whether or not your should send a message to Jimin, not wanting to sound more clingy than he already thought you were but you did love him and didn’t want him to work himself to death. You then unlocked your phone and decided to send Jimin a message. ’Who taught you to be so small? Who taught you that your cracks were flaws? Who told you that your light couldn’t shine through the fractures and scars? Who told you to accept what you were told, even when it’s untrue? Who told you that any love was better than no love? Do not listen to them.Their mouths are full of turpentine and cyanide. They strip all the fold from your wings and leave you unraveled- all pock marked, pink skinned and alabaster boned. You were not made to be grounded Jimin. You were born with wings and need crisp air, a belly full of laughter, a heart carrying so much love you feel it stretching the seams. Mostly, you need to realize that one by one the population has swelled to billions, but even still you were hand selected, all the beauty and flaws, to never be replicated. You are the finest art to have ever been created.’You tossed your phone after you sent the message and turned on your favorite TV show deciding to day would be dedicated to you trying to forget the perfect day you had set up and settle for binging your favorite shows. After a while the harsh words of your boyfriend and the day was completely forgotten and taken over by your favorite K Drama. Hours later the front door opens, and you don’t even turn your head to look, too invested in your show to even care.  You heard the noise of a bag being dropped on the floor and soon the couch indented, “Hey doll,” Jimin said. Not turning from the TV you offered a fake smile and then waved before listening to the show. “Can I have your attention for one second?” he questions, you look at him for a split second to see his eyes were puffy and red. You didn’t have the heart to deny him, especially if he looked so beaten down. You paused the show on the TV and turned to face him giving him your undivided attention.He didn’t seem ready for it though as he continued to look down at his hands, “I’m sorry for snapping at you like I did today. You were just trying to take care of me, and spend time with me and I blew up in your face.” he looked up at you sadly “Did you really mean all you said?” he asked. You sighed climbing into his lap wrapping your arms around his neck, he loosely placed his arms around your waist. “Of course I did Chim,” you whispered running your fingers along his face soothingly, you sighed “You’ve worked so hard, and have accomplished so much, you should be proud of yourself, I know I’m proud of you. That’s why on your day off I wanted to spoil you.” You rubbed his nose with yours. He smiled as you gently brought your lips down to his giving him a gentle kiss. “I love you Park Jimin, and I don’t care who I have to talk to but I’m getting you all to myself tomorrow.” you said dead serious.“I love you Jagi.”Originally posted by cmtaeTaehyungTae was back on tour for the new comeback and you couldn’t be more happy for him. He loved what he did, and any time Tae was happy so were you. That doesn’t mean you didn’t miss him, you missed him so terribly much, but couldn’t imagine asking him to come back just to be with you. That’s asking to much of him, and you couldn’t do that to Army, you always know he will come back to you and you can see him again, sometimes this is the only chance fans get to see him.Missing Tae comes in waves, somedays it’s just little waves, and you can manage those, but days like today is a tidal wave, and tonight your drowning. Tears roll down your cheeks effortlessly as you lay in bed late at night wishing for your boyfriends long arms around you, holding you in a death squeeze. But you’d have to settle for sleeping in one of his, it barely smelled of him anymore but if you closed your eyes and focused hard enough you could faintly smell him. You settled into sleep when suddenly your phone went buzzing like crazy, making your heart skip a beat in anticipation for finding it because it could be Tae. Once you found it you smiled brightly as it was indeed Tae. Quickly you answered the phone to see his usually bright smiling face to be looking around in frowning in frustration. “I’ve looked everywhere Jagi and I think I’m losing my mind,” he complained before finally looking at you. “You packed with me right? Do you know where I put my favorite sweatshirt?” he asked before digging through his suitcase once again.You bit your lip trying not to giggle at the sight of a frazzled Tae in the dressing room, you knew he didn’t have his favorite sweatshirt because that was the one you were currently wearing. When he packed it in you took it out to keep because you knew it would stay smelling of him the longest. “Tae Tae,” you said as innocently as you could and he finally lifted his head to look at you, “I may or may no have stolen your beloved sweat shirt,” you told him and his face went into the classic V blank face. “Jagi,” he sighed shaking his head sitting down on the couch “You know I love that sweat shirt and I made sure to pack it so I could have it.” He ran his fingers through his hair. Before you could even give him give him your reason he huffed again “Are you that clingy you have to go stealing my stuff?” he continued on this little rant for a while and the tears rolled down your cheeks, but he was too heated to notice. You know he doesn’t mean the harsh words he’s saying and he’s probably is just stressed, but you missed him and the only time he calls to talk is to yell at you.“Tae…. stop, ” You whimpered before hiding your face to wipe the tears off your cheeks, you heard him sigh and you sniffled recollecting yourself. “I’m sorry I constantly want to talk to you. And that I get sad when you take to long to reply.  I’m sorry you don’t want to talk to me as much as I want to talk to you. I’m sorry if I think about you too much and too often. I’m sorry if I tell you about my pointless drama when you don’t really care. I’m sorry if I do things that piss you off, like stealing your sweatshirt, or if I come off as annoying and clingy, but it’s just me missing you.”“Oh Jagi… I didn’t mean to snap at you, you look adorable swamped in my clothes, you can wear any of my clothes from the dorm. I didn’t realize you’d miss me so much, ” he teased smiling at you. “I love you too Jagi. I think of you every morning when I wake and every night before I sleep. I can still feel your arms tightly around me, and taste your kiss long after our goodbye. Your voice rings in my ear. I’m in pain here without you Jagi, I love you so so much, two months until you come,” he said with a smile, “Fighting!”Originally posted by mvssmediaJungkookJungkook and Tae had been playing the latest update of Overwatch for the passed three days, they only stop to eat, pee and sleep. They had also had just recently come back from tour and all you wanted to do was be pulled into your muscle pigs arms and see that bunny smile as he tells you of the silly adventures he and the boys went on during tour. Instead you were sitting behind the two heads watching as characters fight each other, not even being able to touch him because it’s 'distracting’. After the round was over Tae called pee break and snack, Jungkook whips out his phone and starts looking up better strategies on how to beat Tae. You slide onto the floor next to Jungkook and rested your head on his shoulder reading what he was doing. “Kook-ah when is this game going to be over.” you questioned looking up into his brown eyes that were trained on his phone. “Kook-ah!” you whined slapping his phone out of his hand  and he finally look at you with an eyebrow raised.“When is this game going to be over?” you mumbled playing with his sweatshirt “I wanna cuddle my lil’ bunny,” you said pressing a kiss to his cheek. Tae then comes running in with snacks in hand as he sit back down in his spot next to Jungkook handing him some snacks before resuming the next game. You huffed and fell back on the floor before taking your phone out and going through all of your social medias. It was at least a good half hour before you started poking his cheek again “Kookie I wanna cuddleee,” you whined once again.He was in the middle of an intense match and huffed at your attempts “Could you like chill? God Y/n why do you have to be so clingy?” he replied through gritted teeth before the game said over. “And now I lost, happy? Now do you want to cuddle until you hearts content telling me about the stupid shit that has happened while I was gone?” he snapped glaring at you. You’ve never seen this side of Jungkook before, to you he was always your sweet adorable bunny, but right now he was kind of scary.“Kook-ah-” Tae scolded but Jungkook would have none of it “I just got back home from tour and all I wanted to do was relax and unwind playing some overwatch, but you come here being a needy-” “Kook-ah!” Tae said smacking him in the back of the head, Jungkook glared at him as you quickly wiped the tears off your cheeks, collecting your things and standing up.“I’ve really missed you Jungkook, six months is a long time to go apart without actually seeing each other. I know we skyped and called and texted but it’s not like having you here with me. I missed you so so much while you were away.” you sniffled looking down at your feet “Saying I miss you doesn’t even cover it really… When you are missing from my world and there just aren’t any words that could describe how truly difficult it is most days to exist without you. It’s better some days but even that has its own hurt too.” You looked up giving him a sad smile “Sorry I ruined your game.”You walked slowly out of the room shutting the door behind you as the tears fell like a waterfall. You walked through the house carefully not wanting to run into any of the other boys knowing they would question what was wrong, and you just didn’t want to talk about it any more. You walked over to the front door and pulled your jacket on before sitting down on the ground next to all the shoes. You slipped each your feet in before lifting your hands to try and tie your shoes, but they were far too shaky to function, so you had to settle with them untied as you stood back up.You pulled open the door and stepped out into the cold Seoul air and slowly walked off the boys property, hands shoved in your jacket pockets. You were getting so lost in your own thoughts you didn’t even hear Jungkook running up to you, that was until he got hold of your arm stopping you in place. You furrowed your eyebrows and looked up at the now slightly out of breath boy in front of you, before pulling your arm out of his grasp “You’ve made yourself quite clear Jungkook.” It was as if his own name hurt him because he winced a little.“Don’t call me that, call me Kookie, or lil bun or muscle pig, even Kook-ah would be better,” he told you, you rolled your eyes crossing your arms over your chest “I’m sorry for what I said earlier, but I really hate losing and Tae wins ALL THE TIME.” he shook his head “Not that, that is a good enough excuse, trust me, Hyung gave me a good lecture.” You giggle at the thought of goofy Tae giving Jungkook advice, and he smiled at the sound. “Come back and we can cuddle and catch up on everything,” he told you.“I don’t know if you missed me like I missed you Kook-ah, I feel like maybe you don’t love me how I love you.” you told him honestly looking down at your feet, only to notice he was wearing two different shoes, one being a lot larger than the other, obviously because he ran out in such a rush. Then he did something you’d never expect your shy lil’ bun to do, he took your chin between  his fingers and tilted your head up before pressing his warm lips to yours. You melted into the kiss as he deepened it, pulling you closer. You surely did miss this, but you still pulled away, his lips now against your forehead. “Tell me you love me,” you whispered.“I do love you!” he said taking your face between his hands making you look at him and his serious eyes “I love the way your hair looks in the morning, or how your nose wrinkles when you laugh. I love the way you sneeze and dribble toothpaste down your chin when you brush your teeth. And my heart,” he lifts your hand and places it to his chest where his heart hit it rapidly “almost beats out of my chest when I wake up and the first thing I see is you sleeping peacefully beside me. I’d kill for mornings like those. I feel waves breaking in my ribcage every time I leave you because it pains me to go. Even on my worst days if I think of you and everything is instantly better. I love you so much, Y/n, please come back to my place and cuddle me.”“I love you too Jungkook.”Requests are open

            BTS Reaction- Young 8th Member        Originally posted by caughtinjiminJinYou know how Jin babies Jungkook? Imagine that times 10. Literally, hello, I’m you new mom, you’re my baby. Even though you are more mature than Jungkook 90% of the time, you would still be babied the most by Jin. You staying up to late with the other Maknae’s- he’ll come get you and make you sleep with him. You’re over exhausted but still practicing, he will scold you and force you home. You’re sick, he will take all the blankets in the whole dorm, wrap you up into a burrito, turn on your favorite TV shows, and feed you homemade soup. Jin loved you just as much as the rest (Let’s be honest, he loves you more than the rest) and treats you with the respect of a little sister. He’d be the shoulder you cried on, the one you made you laugh, the one to push you (but not too hard). Eomma Jin is basically obessed with you. I can only imagine him watching from the side of the stage as you preform your solo song, he’d be so full of pride, and scream louder than the Army did. “Jinnie Oppa why are you holding me?”“You’re growing up too fast.”“… I need to practice”“In a minute.”Originally posted by 2nep1nkYoongiYou know how Suga secertely takes care of the others? Yeah he’d flat out do anything for you.You ask him to make you food, he suddenly becomes a master chef. You ask him to teach you how to produce your own music- He will give you a full college course. You ask him who’s his favorite member and you name will leave his lips immidently. The younger boys are jealous of the fact that he so openly cares for you, but you didn’t mind, he was the only one who didn’t treat you like a baby.(The others don’t try to, but you’re just too cute) He’s the one you go to when you need to have a serious talk with someone, he’s your number one advice guy.He probably also give you the code to his studio so that if you ever needed to escape all the guys you could hide yourself in there, with or without him. He’s probably also the one to be super protective over you. If you guys are doing a music video and they want you to do something he deems dangerous, he calls the idea stupid. He thinks the punishment for one of their games is too harsh, he’ll take the hit for you. The maknae’s won’t stop teasing you, he’ll snap at one of them just to shut them up. If you were ever to get a boyfriend, don’t expect him to last long, at least not if Yoongi is around.“Yoongi do you ever think I’ll be in love.”“When you’re older maybe.”“I wish I was.”“Trust me kid, stay young as long as possible, adulting sucks.”Originally posted by jkookisdaddyHoseokThis little ball of sunshine would be your personal cheerleader. Everything you did, Hoseok was there to witness it. You and Jimin practice dancing, he’d be there saying how well you are doing. You playing video games against Jungkook, he’d root for you. You’re singing in the shower, he’s sitting outside the door clutching his heart like an angel had struck him. Even if you completely sucked at something, he’d still say you did fine, and that if you practiced a little more you’d be the best. In his eyes, there’s nothing you could not do, and he’d support you either way. He’s the one who would always offer to practice with you, whether it be dancing or singing, or being an adult.He’d also be the one to join in on your silliness right away. Some might see him as immature but as long as you were laughing and having fun he could care less what those other people thought. You want to go to the park, he’d join you in a heartbeat. You want to take a vacation to Brazil, get packing he’s already bought the ticket. Basically he’s trying to be your ride or die, anything you are doing he wants to do too. I think he just wants to see you grow up, because to him your his little sister and he wants to be there. “Hoseok Oppa, this is a girls night.”“I can wear a dres!”“That doesn’t mean you’re not a man.”“But Y/n I wanna come too!”“No.”Originally posted by myloveseokjinNamjoonJoon is a great leader, he is a even better brother.He’d put your health before everything, his own health, the guys health, the armys health, you were top priority to him. He was the one to calm you down. If you were nervous and on the brink of tears, he’d be the one to pull you aside and remind you how hard you’ve worked and how if you do your best the armys will be happy with your preformance. If you were being pushed too far he’d be the one to tap you out, even if you tried to persist it’d be useless because he’s already reagranging everything so that they can go on without you. If you were teary eyed because you felt like you did bad, he’d be the one to tell you that there’s no point in crying over it and that you can only do better.No one really knew this but he took care of you the most. He always made sure you drank water, and had eaten food. Always made sure that your favorite chips were in the kitchen. You never knew why you had an endless supply of tampons. He paid for your phone and the long distance calls to your parents. He always supported you, picked you up after you fell down, dusted you off and sent you on your way again, without so much as a word. He always tried his best to find solutions to any of your problems, no matter how small or minor they seemed. He did his best to keep you going, without you even knowing he was the one behind it all.“Joonie do I not sing as well as Jungkook?”“You sing very well.”“I wish I had more parts in songs.”“My new song has lots of parts just for you.”Originally posted by outrojkJiminYou know how people have their own emotional support dogs? Jimin was yours.Most of the boys didn’t want to handle all the girl hormones that come with growing up. So they tend to ignore you when you throw tanturms or cry over stupid things. All of them except Jimin. He let you sob into his shirt for hours, even if you crying over something as dumb as breaking your nail. If you were angry he let you take out that pent frustration on him, and he talked back with equally enough force as your screams trying to calm you down. If you were throwing another one of your tamrums he’d just wrap you up in his arms and whisper silly things into your ear until you were smiling and giggling again. It wasn’t a one way street though. The two of you were probably the most emotional ones in the whole group, so you often confided in each other. You’d end up telling each other things you wouldn’t dare tell the others because they’d tease you and call you soft. Some nights the two of you shared a bed and talked all night about the things, mostly emoitons and feelings, things the other boys won’t talk about. It made you feel less alone seeing as your the only girl, at least you had someone you could be a little more girly with. “Jimin-ah, can I paint your nails?”“…. Will the others be able to see it?”“We can use clear polish, it’s just make your nails look nicer.”“… Yeah go ahead.”Originally posted by dongkookiTaehyungMeet your new, mobile, stuffed animal.You need a hug, Taehyung’s your guy, he’d already have his long arms open wide ready to take you in. You wanna cuddle with someone while watching a movie, he’d go make some popcorn. You don’t want to sleep alone because your homesick? He and his bed are waiting for you with covers opened up. You’re nervous about going onto stage? He’s already holding your hand. Any kind of skinship you offer, he will accept full throttle. He found you so adorable and cute, he’d always want to be touching you somehow, hugs, cheek kisses, hand holding, pinching your cheeks, whatever it was he wanted to do it.He also doubled as your shopping buddy. You want to go shopping for a new dress, Taehyung will literally offer to go with you before you even ask if anyone will. He’d especially love it when you let him take the reins and allow him to dress you up. He loved fashion and it’s not often he wears women’s clothes, so he’s always excited when you ask him to pick something out for you. Let’s be honest here, he’d probably drop hella dollars on some Gucci for you and rip off the tag so you’d never know how much he spent. He just loves you, that’s all.“Taehyungie?”“Hmmm?”“I can’t sleep…”“Come here.”Originally posted by jjeongukJungkookLet’s be real here, Jungkook would see you as competition.He’s used to being the baby of the group and when suddenly the group dynamic changed and you were the baby he got a little jealous. He’d be even more obnoxious and funny just to get attention of the older boys. Or he would trying to be extra cute, especially when they were cooing over how good or cute you were. He’d pick on you and tease you, just like other brothers do. He’d wrestle you, steal your stuff and hide it from you, pull stupid pranks on you, and overall annoy you. But he loved you.He wasn’t the best at showing it, because that sort of thing makes him uncomfortable, but when he did it was all hearts. Especially if it’s just the two of you getting along and hugging or something, all the older boys would be melting and taking pictures of their two babies getting along. Which they of course embarrassed Jungkook about later because it’s easy to wile him up about it. So eventually he just breaks and yells “OBVIOUSLY I LOVE HER! SHE’S MY LITTLE SISTER.” afterwards he’d probally get all red and refuse to look any of you in the eyes. So, you’d have to go over to him and hug him again smiling up at him “I love you too Jungkookie Oppa.” You’re the only girl he’d let call him that.“Your hair looks stuipid.”“Your face looks stupid.”“You’re stupid.”“At least I GRADUATED!”“KOOK-AH THAT’S MEAN!”
