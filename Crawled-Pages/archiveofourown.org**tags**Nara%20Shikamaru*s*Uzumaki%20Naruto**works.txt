    Summary
      I've seen some collections of soulmate prompt fills and have always wanted to do some of my own. 
Each chapter will be a different pairing and a different soulmate au.
Edit: How it works! An explanation here, for any new comers. This collection is run entirely on prompts from my readers, I do not choose the pairings myself. When prompts open I allow a twelve hour window for anyone interested to throw their idea in to the pot. After the twelve hours are up I use a random number generator to select ten different prompts to fill. After I have filled all ten prompts I open another round. Rinse and repeat! Check the end notes of the most recent chapter to see how many chapters are left in the current round! 
Here is a link to the pairings that I write for and the characters that I do not accept prompts for.

      Naruto was underestimated by many. They assumed she was just a dumb blonde so that was her role to play. Though another ninja hidden in the shadows could see right through her facade. Female Naruto X Shikamaru Naruto #1 hyperactive knucklehead ninja FemNaru/Shika Naruto the stupid Genius/ Shikamaru the lazy Genius(Brought from ff.net smut free version will be on that site)

    Summary
      “Freaking, stupid, pieces of shit, where the fuck, lack of brains, how the fuck, I’m going to kill them both-”Speak of the devil, Sasuke gasped, trying not to laugh as he forced his body to move through the hysteria breaking through his paling skin. Shikamaru, according to Naruto, was just beginning to like Sasuke. Sasuke was no fool, no one in their graduating class liked him, much to Naruto’s dismay. (Unless you counted the fangirls than Sasuke would rather die than let them get too close. Comrades or not Sasuke wasn't looking for a….female partner at the moment.) Shikamaru was the only one in their class willing to listen to Naruto as he tried to explain Sasuke’s lack of emotions, or faith, or lack of something, as some of the other’s put it. He was just beginning to get close to Sasuke and Naruto, even when they fought most of the time during their ‘meetings’. Shika was really starting to get along with them both, even dragging them home when they did something stupid.orWhere Shikamaru, Naruto, and Sasuke end up in the past and well... Who would have thought it turned out that way, you know?

    Summary
      "It takes a village to raise a child" Uzushio is that village. She's been alive longer than anyone else, has loved and lost more children than anyone can comprehend. She's more than just the ninja village and after the Fall she has had enough. She ventures out into the world to look for her lost children. Along the way she becomes a magnet for abandoned, lost and dangerous children(She wonders if all adults are incompetent at childcare? Maybe she should write a parenting manual at the end of all this? Sage knows the parents and villages her foundlings are from could do with one!).Mama Uzu builds a family and feeds them. Maybe she fixes some problems along the way, after all isn't that what mothers do? Jinchuriki-centric (because those babies were hard done by), strong female characters (because they were also hard done by) and people have conversations and hugs (because they are necessary for healthy growth).Next Chapter - Kakashi Part Six:Kakashi and Itachi are permitted onto Uzushio. They go to the hospital where all of Uzu's children are. Kakashi gets a surprise.Updates on Tuesdays and Saturdays!

    Summary
      One simple decision. One simple change in the known timeline to make a difference. While their fates and the echo of the past is the same, their paths and their songs diverge from the original. They have a chance to be something else, something they never had the opportunity to be.Or: The Hokage boldly decides to not care about traditions, and breaks up this generation’s Ino-Shika-Chou formation. Naruto, Sasuke and Shikamaru – the hyperactive loud-mouth, the arrogant jerk, and the lazy ass – in the same team should be a disaster. But is it really?This is a story exploring the possibilities of different team dynamics from the canon, and giving characters a chance to be more than what they were in the original.
