    Summary
      To one who has lived a full life, death is but the next greatest adventure… or at least, that is how it should be if one wasn't going to be killed well short of a full life. Figuring out what to do when one of Death's trinkets throws a spanner wrench into things is another thing entirely.

    Summary
      Reborn, young aspiring hitman that he is, finds himself falling for the lone cafe owner of a tiny place down the marketplace in his suburb. Tsuna is a little odd, and definitely more than a handful, but sometimes he gets a look in his eye that seems like he lives far beyond even Reborn's reach.(At only 19 years of age, Tsunayoshi Sawada, Neo Vongola Primo or Vongola Decimo, dies young.Still at 19 years of age, he wakes to find himself long before he's even born and no way back.With nothing else he can do, he makes the most of it.He just wasn't expecting to fall in love with the young version of his former? future? tutor.)

    Summary
      Tsuna’s never craved the spotlight like Ienari does, preferring to keep quiet and stay on the sidelines, so it’s only natural for his brother to stand out so much more. But being different – being himself – means a mother who calls him useless and a brother who bullies him without remorse, and Tsuna doesn’t have enough tolerance to overlook either for very long. He won’t change who he is just to make them like him though so he takes the only option left – he leaves. Three years later, Reborn arrives to train Nari, only to discover that there’s one Sawada missing.
