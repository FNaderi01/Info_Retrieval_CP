He participated in the engagements of Gechkenli and Seliolu during the battle of Kirk Kilisse and the attack at Chataldzha. On 5 August 1913 he was promoted Lieutenant General.
During the Second Balkan War he was in command of the 5th Army which successfully fought against the Serbs.
First World War (1914-1918)[edit]
During the Bulgarian participation in World War I (1915–1918) General Toshev was in charge of the 3rd Army which routed the Russian-Romanian Army in the Dobruja campaign defeating it in the battles at Tutrakan, Dobrich and Cobadin, but after serious conflicts with the German General August von Mackensen he was replaced with General Stefan Nerezov. Toshev was appointed governor of Macedonia.[2] On 25 March 1917 he was promoted General of the Infantry - the highest military post in Bulgaria. 
In 1918 Toshev commanded 4th Army and from June 1919 went into the reserve. Between 1923-1924 he was a chairman of the "Association of the reserve officers". In October 1923 he led the "Narodna Priznatelnost" committee whose aim was to make assistance for the victims of the Communist insurgents during the September Uprising.[3]
General Stefan Toshev died on 27 November 1924 in Plovdiv and was buried in Sofia. One town (General Toshevo) and a village are named after him.
