    Summary
  Kintsugi (jap. 金継ぎ, "golden joinery"): the art of mending broken pottery with gold, silver, or platinum, treating breakage and repair as part of the history of an object rather than something to reject and hide.
Mike is back in town; alone, lost, and looking for something he hasn’t quite figured out himself. But time didn’t stand still in New York either. The firm he left behind isn’t the same he’s returning to, and what he’s expecting to find may not be what’s waiting for him. In the months gone by, Harvey has moved on, and Mike has to face the possibility that he might have come back too late.Can they mend what broke between them, or is the damage too big to repair this time?

    Summary
      "She had no shortage of validation these days. Hell, it was probably the mortification of her exit from Runway that had fueled her magna cum laude from Harvard law, and the subsequent appointment at Pearson Hardman. Her job was to win, so she won. Frequently. This would be no different. And if Miranda saw her do it—well. Icing on the cake. "*updated with some edits after two excellent beta reads!!!*

    Summary
      In Mike's experience being an omega, a male omega nonetheless, is nothing to be desired. On the contrary. So from an early age on he hides what he is, no matter the costs. Until one day he quite literally is swept off his feet by an alpha and his whole life changes, whether he likes it or not.
