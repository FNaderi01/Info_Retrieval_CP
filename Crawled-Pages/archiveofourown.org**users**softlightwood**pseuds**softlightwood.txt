    No Archive Warnings ApplyNeil Josten/Andrew MinyardNeil Josten Andrew Minyard Matt Boyd Danielle "Dan" WildsAFTG Remix 2019 andrew has tattoos but is also Soft matt is an idiot but we love him
    Summary
      Matt leaps up from the sofa, folding Neil into a bone-crushing hug and smacking a kiss to his forehead, almost definitely leaving cocktail-residue behind. “Buddy! You came! I cannot wait to meet your…”He trails off, mouth falling open in a soft ‘O’. Andrew, who is still attached to Neil by the hand, lifts his free arm in a mock-salute. “Boyd”“Huh,” says Matt. “I - huh”“What?” asks Dan, drawing herself away from her conversation with Kevin. Then, “Andrew is Andrew?!”It seems like a movie cliché, but the room falls ominously silent. Neil’s mouth quirks up in a little smile. “Andrew is Andrew, yes”“Except for Sundays,” Andrew adds, voice a low deadpan.

    Summary
      Andrew's eyes slide to Neil’s own, hazel and framed with eyelashes dark enough to belie his natural hair colour, and his expression does something complicated. “Neil, I presume?”
“Andrew,” Neil nods, confirming and asking all in one. 
Andrew hums. “Audacious of you to laugh at my height when you look to make a pretty decent arm-rest for Kevin, yourself”
“Not your height,” Neil allows, “your pride. I would have gotten a stool”
“I would have pushed you off of it”

    Summary
      Neil Josten had walked into the Foxhole Court a jumble of lies and loose ends and somehow he had been lucky enough to find a family. It seems inexplicable that after everything, he’s allowed to walk out of the other end with a future and a plan and, most surprising of all, Andrew Minyard by his side. Or, Neil plays his last game as a Fox

    Summary
      The smile splitting Neil’s face in two is a soft thing, gentle and wonderful and the most genuine the expression has ever felt settled into his mouth. “I think you like putting up with me”“Shut up”“Make me,” Neil tells him.“Marry me,” Andrew replies.

    Summary
      Renee finally asks, “how would you feel about the others sitting in on one of our sessions?”Andrew considers this. They take a few more swings at one another; Andrew manages to send her down to her knees with one arm twisted behind her back but makes the mistake of standing too close. Renee hooks her free arm back around Andrew’s own knee and finds a pressure point that turns his entire leg into jelly.From the ground, Andrew says “I do not care to spar with inexperienced idiots”Renee says, “neither do I, but I still spar with you”Or, the Foxes are cordially invited to watch Renee Walker hand Andrew Minyard his ass

    Summary
      Life goes on after the Foxes win the championship, and for Andrew and Neil it's uncharted territory with only each other for guides. Maybe it's time to put away some of those hard edges, and learn how to touch more softly, and speak more honestly. And if they falter, they have their family to help them get back on their feet.

    Summary
      Ashton's wandered over, done with fucking around with his drum kit, and Calum curls a hand loosely against Ashton's leg, looking around at all of them. They're in their own little circle, away from all of the crew members and security.“Just—” He swallows and licks his lips. “You ever feel like something is going on, or is going to happen, and like, it's not good, and you know you can't do anything? Like—”“Like bad weather coming,” Michael says. “Bad weather,” Calum repeats softly. “Maybe there'll be torrential rain and we'll have to cancel,” Ashton says, clearly trying to inject some humour into the air.Calum squints off into the distance. Luke follows his eyes, but has no idea what he's looking at. “Yeah, maybe,” Calum says. (People all over the world start vanishing into thin air. Calum is one of them.)
