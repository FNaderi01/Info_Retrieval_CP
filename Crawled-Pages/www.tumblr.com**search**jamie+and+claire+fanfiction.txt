            Things You Said - Claire/Jamie one-shot drabbles        In order to get my feet wet in the world of Outlander fanfic, I decided to write some one-shot AU drabbles based on the “things you said” prompts. Feedback is extremely welcome.Things You Said After You Kissed MeShe isn’t a jealous person.Truly, it’s a useless emotion and Claire Beauchamp has no
time for it. She was never jealous, not when she saw women flirting with her
fiancé, nor when he announced he was leaving her for a former student.So, really, if she was going to be jealous, it would have
been then, not when she saw the pair of them walking into the jazz club she
forced herself to go to.While she may not feel jealousy towards the girl (Candy?
Trixie?), she does feel a very specific emotion towards Frank.Competitiveness. Why should he get to walk around, happy and in love, while
she mopes about like a pathetic spinster? 27 years old is too young to be a spinster. She’s a doctor,
damn it, and a desirable woman.So she does the first thing that pops into her slightly
whisky-soaked brain: grab the handsome red headed stranger sitting two seats
away and kiss him for all she’s worth. It’s a great plan, if she does say so
herself. Sure, there’s a possibility of things going terribly wrong, but
there’s no time to consider that outcome. Thankfully, the stranger is only stunned into stillness for three
seconds. She feels one large hand slide into her hair, gripping the curls
lightly as he responds to the kiss. His other hand rests respectfully on her
shoulder. If she wishes he would move that hand to her back, pull her tightly
into his embrace, that’s just the whisky talking. The sound of a man clearing his throat somewhere to her
right causes her to slowly disengage from the gorgeous stranger, their eyes
locked. His gaze shines bright with confusion and hunger and the urge to ignore
the interruption and get back to the task at hand is strong. Unfortunately, the interruption speaks and breaks the spell.
“Hello Claire.”His voice, smarmy and haughty, grates on her nerves. How did
she ever think he was the one? Why did she think she wanted to marry this man
and spend her life with him?“Hello Frank,” she responds, her tone cool and
disinterested. Gesturing vaguely to his female companion, she continues, “and
this is?”“This is Sandy. My…fiancée,” he answers with slight
trepidation. Again, Claire feels no jealousy over the situation. She doesn’t
wish she still held that title and she doesn’t feel her heart crack in her
chest. At most, she feels anger that he’s moved on so fast with this woman, as
if their relationship meant nothing.Lost in thought, Claire nearly misses Frank extending his
hand towards her unwitting accomplice. “Frank Randall.”“Jamie Fraser,” he introduces himself with a lyrical Scottish
brogue and a hard gripping handshake – Claire doesn’t miss the slight wince on
Frank’s face. “Claire’s husband.”If she had been taking a drink at that moment, it would have
ended up all over Frank and Sandy/Candy/Trixie. As it is, she coughs slightly
to cover up her surprise at his impromptu answer.“Husband?” Frank seems as surprised by this change in
marital status as Claire is. His eyes widen as he searches her face for
answers.“Oh aye, going on one month now. Bit of a whirlwind romance,
ye ken? We met right at this very club and from the first moment, I knew there
could be no other.”Her fake husband grabs her hand reverently, stroking his
thumb over her knuckles in a tender gesture. She can’t help but catch his eye,
marveling at the shade of blue and at the mischief hiding there. Finally
registering Frank’s silence, she glances over to see a rare lack of composure
taking over him.“Well…I guess congratulations are in order,” he says with no
real confidence or sincerity. Claire’s not sure if the shock is plain on her
face, but she smiles tightly and nods.“Thank you, Frank. Congratulations to you both as well.”The awkward silence stretches on before Jamie stands,
reaching several inches taller than Frank. “Ready to head out, mo nighean donn?”Stunned, Claire barely manages a nod and a polite goodbye to
Frank and his new fiancée. She feels Jamie’s fingers squeeze hers reassuringly
before they make their way to the exit hand in hand. Claire doesn’t even offer
a parting glace at the man she used to love, leaving him in shocked silence
with his new future.“I’m sorry if I got a little carried away back there, lass.
I just thought you might like to one up the bastard,” Jamie explains with a
self-deprecating shrug and a smirk once they’re out the door.“You?” she exclaims, eyes wide, “I practically accosted you
without so much as a ‘hello, how are you?’ I didn’t give you much of a choice
in the little charade.”“Weel, I’ve no been accosted by such a bonnie lass before.
Did you no see me working up the nerve to talk to you all night?”Claire can feel the blush warming her cheeks in the cool
night air. “As a matter of fact, I didn’t. “Finally taking stock of their surroundings, she notes that
they’re a couple blocks away from the bar, hands still clasped together. She
ponders letting go for a brief moment before tightening her grip, enjoying the
feel of his warm palm against hers.“Since you so brazenly attacked me at the bar, I think you
owe me a favor, lass.”“Oh really?” she asks with a smile fighting to take over her
face. “And what, exactly, did you have in mind?”Stopping in the middle of the sidewalk, Jamie gestures to
the diner a few paces away. “A quick bite to eat?”She finds herself unable to slow her rapid heartbeat in the
face of his bright grin. Not trusting her voice, she nods and allows him to
lead her inside the nearly empty establishment.If Claire fancied herself a competitive person, she would
definitely declare herself the winner.

            Fic: The Veils of Time        An attempt at something with a bit more plot.This fic is set in the book/show world during the twenty years separation. Angst warnings apply———————————————————————————————-“Go fuck yourself” She muttered under her breath but loud enough to hear. Or loud enough to hear if the pompous bastard ever stopped his litany of all her failings as a wife and mother. “Really Claire, you can’t keep doing this. Just leaving events. People are starting to talk”“Frank, it was the hospital, it was my job. It’s not like I just stood up and walked out” She was exasperated. Whilst she supposed that in many respects she was lucky, Frank had supported her decision to go to medical school, understood that medicine was who she was, he was also demanding and proud. His position, both professional and social mattered to him. Claire’s demanding job as a surgeon did not fit into that.He wasn’t listening. “…and Brianna, she hardly knows if she is coming or going, can you begin to imagine what it must be like for her. I do my best but a girl needs a mother, not a surgeon.”This hit her where she bled. Brianna. Her daughter. Their daughter. The insinuation that she was failing her, that she was less than she should be to her.  The memories of Jamie came thick and fast. The control she kept so meticulously, except for sometimes, in the wee small hours of the night when the veil of time seemed so thin that she could almost reach out and touch him, fell away.  Brianna. All that was left of him that was not inside her head. The living breathing proof that he had lived, they had loved so, so passionately, so intensely, so briefly. Brianna, whose red hair and slanted cat like blue eyes could come only from him. God, she was so like him.Claire reeled like she had been hit, stepping backward clutching her chest like her heart might spill from her chest without it.“Don’t you fucking dare” she hissed as she attempted to reign in her feelings, to damp them back down where they couldn’t hurt her, where they wouldn’t threaten to consume her.Frank rolled his eyes, her glass face clearly betraying the tsunami of emotion and memory and pain. “Jesus, Claire, not this again. It’s been 10 years. He’s gone, he left you high and dry and pregnant. And let’s not start that rubbish about the stones again.”Claire fought the urge to slap him, to claw at his face. She wanted to hurt him. To visit on him all the pain she felt right in that moment. The urge obviously showed and Frank took a step back. Instead though she inhaled and exhaled slowly in an attempt to get control of her feelings. She managed it. Just.  Feeling like her mind and body were disconnected she slowly walked from the kitchen, concentrating only on putting one foot in front of the other, as her knees shook and threatened to give out beneath her. She sat in the lounge room in the darkness. Brianna and Frank had both long since gone to bed. She had gone through the rest of the evening like a wraith, outwardly there but in reality not connected to her surroundings. She was drowning in pain. She thought she might die of it. She fought the urge to curl into a ball, to try and surround the pain and contain it. Jamie. He was everywhere. In the sound of Brianna laughing as she told them about her day, in the soft red gold glint of her hair under the electric lights, in the overwhelming love she felt for this child. The child he had sent her back through the stones to save. The one who they had each severed themselves from part of their souls for. Jamie had been right, she knew. They had survived. Brianna had thrived. She was tall and strong and stubborn and curious. She was safe.“Oh Jamie” Claire felt the tears spill down her face. There alone in the dark, she closed her eyes and conjured him to her. She brought him forth and let herself feel it all. The pain, the loss, the sadness, the love. All of it.She saw him stood tall and proud as a viking. That magnificent read hair, those broad shoulders. He stood head and shoulders above other men. She saw him as the boy on the cusp of manhood that he was when he took her to wife, when he promised her the protection of his body against anything that came, she saw him as the man, there at the stones of Craig Na Dun who made good on that vow.She brought her hands to her lips. Closing her eyes she brought forth the feel of his lips on hers. Gentle at first, soft with promise, and then harder, his tongue searching for hers, the feel of his teeth on her bottom lip, the pounding of their hearts as they breathed each other in, hands tangled in hair, fingers on flesh, wanting, seeking, having. She brought her hand down her neck imagining the feel of his mouth on her throat, moving downward, strong arms bracing her, pulling her closer. Her own hands lost in the tangle of his curls, feeling their way across the soft skin and hard muscle of his chest and stomach. His head between her thighs, teeth nipping sensitive flesh, tongue roaming. Her voice coming louder and faster, calling his name as she fell into the precipice only to be rescued by him once again.She gasped there alone in the dark and she remembered the feeling of him moving inside her. His hands under hips and hers on his haunches as they tried to bring each other closer, be nearer, become one. She heard the sound of him calling out as he spilled into her, crying out in gaelic, filling her ears with his rich voice as he filled her with his completion.She imagined herself lying in his arms, alone in the dark, the two of them. Talking softly, laughing. His big hands running down her spine, their legs entangled as they slowly succumbed to sleep.Claire awoke stiff and sore in the pale light. For a moment she was confused, “Jamie?” she thought. She bit back a sob as reality reasserted itself. She struggled to sit up, bracing herself against the chintz arm of the sofa. Her mouth tasted vaguely of whiskey. For a moment she searched for him, but the veil had closed. He was lost to her again now and it would do neither of them any good to try and bring him back. With a lingering last memory of his lips on hers, of his final words to her “I will find you”, she stood and turned. She smoothed her rumpled curls and stepped into the hall. 
“Good morning, Frank.”

            One Summer, Part I (Adso)        Here’s to a tropey, frothy summer romp. I found the following definition of the “fling” trope: our lovers intend their relationship to last for a short time (from one night to a specific longer period, such as a vacation or a work project), but their relationship grows beyond those limitations. Sounds like an opportunity for not-super-angsty summer fun to me. This is a new one for me, and I hope you enjoy!Love to @abreathofsnowandwaffles​, @kkruml​, @smashing-teacups​, and @desperationandgin​ who have kept me plugging away at this.One SummerPart I: Adso
At age thirty-three and five months, Claire Beauchamp found herself in an
unfamiliar yellow wallpapered kitchen doing battle with a window.
In the far northern Scottish Highlands.
The industrious efforts of an unidentified amateur house painter had apparently
sealed the window closed under at least half a dozen layers of cigarette-yellow
paint (God knows how many years earlier).  Clad in a t-shirt and
athletic socks, unemployed, and single (none of the above descriptors
constituting afflictions as much as symptoms of empowerment, thank you very
much), Claire didn’t know if she should push or pull to force the window
open.  So she did both in turn with no small amount of profanity narrating her
efforts.
She just needed a little bit of fresh air.
There had been some small victories at the bed and breakfast (or what she
referred to as “the fucking bed and breakfast” instead of “my bed and
breakfast”), enough to sustain her into her third full day in the house,
anyway.  The water in the bed and breakfast had started to run clear only two
days earlier, and the memory of her uncharacteristically ebullient dance in the
foyer as the chandelier overhead buzzed to life with working
electricity was still fresh on her mind.
But the window (the bloody window) was yet another entry on a litany of
“structural peculiarities” (a turn of phrase coined by a contractor)
inherent in the bed and breakfast.  It was (evidently) part of the
home’s “natural charm” (again, the bloody contractor).
“‘Charm’ my English arse….” she muttered, squinting longingly at the
lush green landscape just beyond the stubborn window.  It was an elaborate
tease, having all that nature just outside her reach.  She could almost
feel the cool breeze against her skin, how it would wick sweat from the
back of her neck and carry the crisp mountain valley scent into the mildewed
house.  Through gritted teeth, she hissed, “Come on, you bloody thing!”
The crack started slowly, the fissure initially restrained along an invisible
faultline, a weakness in the pane silently waiting and waiting for
precisely that moment.
The crack grew as she fought more valiantly against the sealed-shut window
(her quarrel with the window stemming from pride as much as a need for some
fresh air in the musty house).  It spread like a lackadaisical fungus until
it bloomed into an invasive species.
By the time the crack swallowed the pane in its entirety, Claire was considering
just putting a dishcloth-wrapped fist through the bloody thing. Rejecting the
inclination, her mind scribbled a mental note to search YouTube for a video on
how to repair glass. (She was unsure whether such a thing was even
possible. The retinue of home and garden television programs that
formed her baseline knowledge for renovating the fucking bed and breakfast had
given her no guidance on such a matter.)
Her foot pressed into a cabinet door for some leverage as she gave the window
one final push, almost bellowing, “How in the hell did I get here?”

            Fanfiction - Scalpel &amp; Needle        @mary-waitforit-lou: Maybe a From Hate to Love au, at first they can’t stand each other and then…
I asked for prompts a few days back and immediately felt the need to write this one. It’s a classical trope that I feel can be quite interesting. I received a couple of other ideas, that are already in store - some are meant to go later into my existing works. Thank you for inspiring me!Scalpel &amp; Needle Part I - Rivalry“I’d be bloody thankful if you didn’t come into
my OR like some kind of unwanted saviour and start to order me around!” Claire
snarled, ripping off her surgical cap, her curls exploding in the air after
sudden liberation, her hair bobble tearing with an audible “pop!”. “I didn’t ask for your help!”“The patient was crashing.” Jamie tried to
explain, remaining eerily calm in spite of the angry woman facing him, looking
like a rattlesnake ready to pounce. “Ye couldna possibly deal with all those
bleeders. I thought a second pair of hands…”“I already had a second surgeon!” She hissed,
pointing at the frightened young resident who had sought refuge against the
wall, clearly wishing to be swallowed by it – and away from the two galvanized
surgeons. “I was in control, using the technique I prefer! But you decided to
come and show off, like some goddam star!”“I was only trying to help, lass.” He grunted,
gripping his fists. His blue eyes were dark and dangerous, tumultuous seas
waiting for ships to wreck on their waves. “It seems to me ye have a bit of a
problem admitting when ye need help and it’s perfectly…”“Oh, you bastard!” Claire roared, advancing to
face him – even though he had the clear advantage of his imposing height.
“Don’t you dare call me “lass”, as
you do to the young nurses, melting them away to do your biding. Stop pretending
you know the first thing about me! You just want to please the board, so
they’ll give you the most challenging cases!”“I couldna care less about the board, Doctor Beauchamp.” Jamie said through
clenched teeth. “Ye should be thanking me that the patient isna heading to the
morgue - instead ye’re yelling at me like a mad banshee, because I wounded yer
pride.”Claire’s cheeks were throbbing with heat, her
chest constricted with a fury she couldn’t even begin to understand. She raised
her index finger and poked him on the chest, wielding it like a dangerous
dagger. “Stay the hell away from me and my OR, Fraser. I mean it!”“Mallaichte
bas! Fine!” He roared, raising his hands in exasperation. “I won’t meddle
again, as much as I think ye might need it. Ye blind woman, stubborn as a
mule…” And he reverted to clipped Gaidhlig,
grumbling in a low voice as he strode down the hallway.“Claire!” She heard the voice of her friend, Geillis
Duncan, gaping at her with her mouth noticeably ajar. Claire was panting, her
vision almost blurred from anger, as she contemplated James Fraser retreating
with a cold satisfaction. “What’s this ruckus all about? Is something amiss?”“Just my esteemed
colleague, James Fraser, being an insufferable prick.” She glared at the other
people surrounding her, frozen in contemplation of the spectacle, silently warning
them to return to their own business. “I really don’t know how someone can be
as egocentric, misogynistic, smug…”“Well, don’t hold anything back, darling.”
Geillis laughed, gently pushing her by the arm to a nearby resting room. “Yer
feud with the man is becoming legendary. There’s probably people placing money
to bet on yer next fight.”“Someone has to show him he’s not even half as
impressive as he fancies himself to be.” Claire puffed, filling a glass with
cold water from the machine in the corner and drinking it down. “Most people think him charming, Claire.” The
nurse pointed, sitting on the small couch – a myriad of unidentifiable stains
garnishing the old fabric. “A verra capable surgeon, kind and concerned with
his patients, humble but with a sharp mind, and a brilliant sense of humour.”“Damn Geillis, don’t you hold anything back either.” She rolled her eyes in disbelief.
“One would think you very enthralled by the man.”“Everyone – well, every lass and probably John
Grey too – kind of is.” The redheaded girl gave her a mischievous smile. “That
is one hell of a ginger fox, Claire. How can ye not want to ride that…”“That’s quite enough, thank you!” Claire hawked
and tried to tame down her revolting hair with her fingertips. “I happen to be
immune to whatever spell he has been casting around here.”“I just don’t understand why ye hate him so
much.” The nurse looked at her with studying eyes, slightly biting her index
finger, her nails a gaudy shade of pink. “Are you trying to conceal the fact
that ye actually find him attractive?” She said in a soft voice. “I know that
after Frank it’s hard for ye to…”“Don’t.” Claire said in a serious voice, the
shadow of a smile gone from her face. “Don’t say that. This has nothing to do
with Frank. I just don’t see what you see, that’s all.”“Alright, I’ll let the subject go – for now.”
Geillis stretched herself like a cat and grinned, preparing to resume her work.
“Drinks tonight at Leoch’s?”“Sure.” Claire nodded absentmindedly, already
studying her next patient’s chart. “I’ll meet you there after I finish my
colectomy.”“Behave until then, ye hear me!” She warned
Claire, leaving her alone to face another surgery.****Claire opened her locker, blood pulsing rapid
inside her vessels, so much so she felt the tidal waves of blood on her
temples. Like she had foreseen, a lonely envelope was there, a bit crumpled
after being pushed through the small gap. With shaking hands and a smile of
anticipation, she opened it. “It has come to my
attention that you had a rough day. I’m sorry to hear it. I thought I would
make it a little better – but this time I’m borrowing the words of a wiser man.
«My struggle is harsh
and I come back with eyes tired at times from having seen the unchanging earth,But when your laughter
enters it rises to the sky seeking meAnd it opens for me
all the doors of life.»I hope to see it again
soon. I shall miss your laughter every second you hide it away.With l Yours,Scalpel”It had started six months before. On a day when
night had forgotten to go away, leaving everything immersed in shadows, rain
pounding over the roof like a furious fist banging. She had lost a patient that day. She recalled
it vividly, because it had been the first since she had moved to Edinburgh. Not
only that – it had been a young woman, with the same hopes and dreams that she
had, heart broken into a million pieces but still hopeful. Losing her had been
like losing a piece of herself, an entire world shattered away under the lights
of the OR. Claire accepted the sympathetic words of her
colleagues, the gentle hands that touched her back, assuring her that not every
battle was meant to be won. But she had lost – so brutally, so completely, so painfully. She walked to the locker room and
bolted the door, allowed herself to cry on the floor, to sob until her heart
had melted and gone away. When she opened her locker to retrieve her
things at the end of her shift, she had found a sketch there, pencil on paper
like the tears on her cheeks. Someone drew a hand – elegant fingers with a thin
wrist, which eerily reminded her of her own – holding a scalpel. And touching
her palm underneath it, as if the fragile scalpel had been too heavy to hold on
her own, a second hand helped her to hold it. The touching image – it had
brought tears to Claire’s eyes – had been signed in a crooked handwriting. “Scalpel”.The drawing had been on her nightstand since
that day, a reminder that someone out there truly understood – knew – the loneliness of her work, the
hardships she endured and how much she needed a presence to hold her when her
strength failed her. The second gift came a week after that – a pressed
blue flower, perfectly preserved, clearly saved for quite some time between the
pages of a book. Claire inhaled it, hungry for the perfume and words still
trapped in it. A short note came with it – “Will
you make a home for it with you? Scalpel”. After a few weeks – time in which she had
received poems, caricatures and photos of landscapes – she decided that her
secret friend – for the mysterious person clearly meant to forge a relationship
with her through those small tokens – deserved an answer. She had scribbled it at home, sitting at her
desk – the pressed flower next to her, on top of an organized pile of paper –
and left it lodged on the door of her locker, where he’d certainly find it.“Dear Scalpel, I’m not sure why you
think me deserving of such kind attentions, but I have to say you seem to read
my mind! Not only I find everything you give me fascinating, but you seem to
guess when I’ll need it the most. If someone ever told me I’d have a secret
correspondent, I’d laugh and swear them insane. But in truth I find great
solace in you and cherish every thought you spare me. Thank you for being a true
friend – the more selfless kind.Cla NeedleP.S. – Of course you
know my real name, but it seems only fair that the both of us would have secret
code names. I’ve been told to be sharp as one - and equally resourceful.” And so
their correspondence became two-sided. A week hadn’t gone by without a sign
from him and Claire realized they were incredibly close – intimate, even. She
had tried to suggest for them to meet and talk in the cafeteria – at least for
him to reveal his name, so she could put a face on the person that meant so
much to her. His answer had been concise and clear: “One day I’ll tell you everything. But not yet.”Claire placed the note on her pocket, where her
fingers could brush it – touching it, savouring it through the next hours. She
headed for the pub to meet Geillis – blissfully unaware of Scalpel’s existence - wondering how one could be enamoured with a man
made only of words on paper.

            One Summer, Part XV (Renovation &amp; Dresser Drawers)        Many thanks to @balfeheughlywed​ for continuing to right my course with this story, @notevenjokingfic​ for never failing to give it to me straight in the kind way only a friend can, and @smashing-teacups​ for somehow not giving up on me with my comma splices/missed words/jacked up grammar. And just as many thanks to everyone who has hung with this story. My little summer project has turned into a bit of a passion, tbh. Finally, real life is kicking my ass right now, but I’m going to catch upon my own reading here soon. Promise. xx.Part I (Adso), Part II (Dislocated), Part III (Entryway), Part IV (Pizza &amp; Beer), Part V (Croissants &amp; Coffee), Part VI (SMS), Part VII (Desktop), Part VIII (Sunday Sunflowers &amp; Sundresses), Part IX (Caught Out), Part X (Netflix &amp; Advil), Part XXI (Ben Nevis &amp; Loch Lomond), Part XII (Non-Negotiable), Part XIII (Same), Part XIV (Toothbrushes &amp; Eyeglasses)One SummerPart XV: Renovation &amp; Dresser Drawers
Working in tandem, it took Jamie and Claire three weeks of near-daily weeknight labor, and the ritual sacrifice of two weekends on the altar of home renovation, to complete two bathrooms. 
It was well into July. As the days withered and the month disappeared in a ceaseless march towards August, Claire filed away their self-imposed expiration date.
A certain domesticity swept Claire up. It was born of working together. Without any reticence, she allowed daydreams to weave a diaphanous covering over her more pragmatic side. Daydreams involving explicitly homey notions of curating a mutual space. 
A home.  
Any home. 
Even one that would, of necessity, be stripped of all conspicuous personal relics (though she had few), photographed (retouched so as to be portrayed to its finest advantage by minor Photoshop tweaks), and monetized.  Even one designed with the specific purpose of inviting strangers inside – strangers who would sleep under hotel-quality linens at a price calculated to be competitive with various local inns and lodges.
Beyond the technicolor daydreams that made Claire’s mind a teasing tilt-a-whirl, she had utterly destroyed two bathrooms with a sledge hammer.  She had done so of her own volition, and it meant that there was no shortage of tiling, painting, and plumbing work to be done.  
On the first weeknight of their labor, after Jamie told her she’d done a “braw job” with the demolition phase, Claire caught her brazenly self-congratulatory reflection in the bathroom mirror.  She was glowing in the kind of way she always thought could be brought about by this serum or that night cream, a rigorous skincare routine (a series of bottles purchased with Geillis’s help that she’d swept with the back of her hand into the rubbish bin before leaving London).  
Evidently, Jamie brought lit-from-within radiance out in spades.

            Fanfiction - The Teacher        
Request for a fic. Everyone is joking about professor Sam in Barbour. Could you write a professor Jamie story. Claire is a student but Older and more intriguing than all the young giggling co-eds
…In the meantime, I had this anon ask sitting on my
inbox for some months now – and I’d hate to let this fantasy go unattended!The TeacherThose girls were ridiculous, Claire thought.
Madly fluttering their eyelashes as if a constant influx of dust was getting
into their eyes and always bending over, using the pretence of catching a
fallen pen or pencil, only to expose their cleavage. Claire felt she was inside
a documentary on the mating rituals of college girls and, even if slightly
amusing, it also disturbed her in an irrational way. Health Management was an extra class for her –
a way to get a couple more credits that would speed up her academic course. She
was already almost ten years the senior when compared to the other students
attending Medical School – her years as a nurse had given her a lot of useful
resources, but also made her feel she was constantly battling time. It was an
interesting class, that mixed concepts of health and economics, to ensure the
future doctors based their decisions in cost-effectiveness. In spite of being
well taught and useful, whispering was a constant background noise – clearly
the result of female hormones going rampant. The problem was not the subject,
Claire knew – was the man leading the class. Professor Fraser was young and remarkably
handsome – his Scottish accent and deep voice, combined with astonishing blue
eyes, which he hid behind black rimmed glasses, inspired great admiration
amongst the women in the classroom. The fact that the class functioned at all
was a testament to Fraser’s capacity of using leadership skills and imposing
respect. A couple of girls next to her giggled and
Claire distinctively heard one of them, a blonde bombshell that undoubtedly
belonged in a house named after a Greek alphabet letter, saying “I would slide my hand bellow his kilt
anytime…”Pursing her lips and rolling her eyes, Claire
continued to sketch with her sharp pencil in the back of her notebook,
struggling to focus again on the contents of the class. The shade in the
external corner wasn’t quite right, she noticed, furrowing her brows in
annoyance.“Am I boring ye, Miss Beauchamp?” She heard a
voice demanding her attention. Claire looked up and noticed all faces turned to
her, clearly awaiting her reaction to being caught distracted. James Fraser
stood next to the board with his arms crossed, his lips forming a half smile,
expecting her answer.Yes. “No, Professor Fraser.” She replied
in a casual tone. “I was just taking notes and got distracted. May you repeat
the question, please?”“I see.” He said in a serious – disappointed? –
tone. “Anyone knows the answer? Miss MacKenzie?”“Replacing the blood gas machine would be the
best measure.” Laoghaire MacKenzie glowed like a lit candle - marvelled that
for once she had managed to upstage Claire and gain Professor Fraser’s
attentions - offering a victorious look through the corner of her eye, which
Claire blatantly ignored.“That is correct.” He nodded, raising a brow in
Claire’s direction. “I’d recommend that ye pay more attention to the class,
Miss Beauchamp.”“I bloody would if it wasn’t for your fan
club.” Claire complained in a low voice, after he had resumed the class.As the class ended – students rushing to the
door to get to the refectory in time for lunch, talking about a hot party later
that week -, Claire assembled her notebooks and pencil, storing them inside her
green rucksack – made of what looked like army green fabric with a painted red
cross, akin to something a doctor would wear during the Second World War.“May I talk to you, Miss Beauchamp?” Professor
Fraser asked politely, as she walked down the stairs in direction of the door.
The room was almost deserted, only a couple of latecomers remained inside,
struggling with coats and piles of books.“Of course, Professor.” Claire stared at him,
expectantly.“Ye were distracted today.” He pointed, closing
the book he had used to prepare the current subject. “Is something bothering
ye, Claire?”“No.” She firmly replied, her eyes downcast.
“I’m sure I can’t be the first student you caught daydreaming. Why are you
making such a big deal about it?”Jamie gave her a concerned look, his blue eyes
wrinkling in the corners. He was sporting a small stubble, that combined with
his impeccable plaid shirt, gave him a look of casual handsomeness. “Ye are one of the best students in the class.”
He said slowly, neatly placing his books inside his own bag. “I wouldna like ye
to squander yer potential. If something is disturbing ye, I’d like to help ye
if I can, that’s all.”“It’s fine.” She insisted in a harsher voice,
her hands slightly trembling. “I don’t really need another man to tell me I’m not good enough and can’t handle things. Because
I am quite capable!”“I’m not saying ye aren’t, Miss Beauchamp.” He
pointed patiently, glaring at her increasingly red face. “In fact, I think I
just said quite the opposite.”“I can’t focus because all the girls around me
are acting like crazy hens, cackling over you!” She accused in a mordant voice,
going completely berserk despite her best rational alarms going off in the
outskirts of her brain. “I’m here to study – I have so much to learn still and
my age will hurt me in spite of how good I keep proving myself again and again –
and all they can think is to shag the teacher!”“Ye’re crossing the line, Claire.” Jamie
warned, his voice now low and dangerous. “I might be younger than ye – just a
few years, really - but ye’re not exactly old enough to convince me ye’re getting senile by acting out and being
disrespectful. I am the teacher here.” “Then
you should bloody act like it!” Claire growled, the hammer of anger – and jealousy?
– pounding against her ribs. “Stop being so nice and attentive, because you’re
clearly giving the wrong message!”“What?!” His mouth was ajar, the pulse on his
temple throbbing in anger. He practically tore his glasses away from his face,
discarding them on the table with a dry sound. “I never made any advances on
one of my students. The mere suggestion my behaviour is borderline unethical is
a verra serious one, Miss Beauchamp. It can get me suspended if anyone in the
faculty board hears it.”“I’m sorry.” She hissed, fidgeting with the
closing mechanism of her rucksack. “But you have to recognize that you are
young and…handsome.” Claire swallowed her, her voice strangled. “You can pass
the wrong impression just from breathing.”“Maybe ye should drop this class.” Jamie suggested,
slightly turning away from her in order to shield his face from her sight. “I
can ask Professor Raymond’s permission for you to assist his Alternative
Medicine class. It will give ye the same credits as mine.”“Yes.” She swallowed hard. “Maybe I should.”
They stood there, facing each other, their eyes battling when words had failed
them. “Claire.” He asked, his voice ragged but
softer, warmer. “Who told you ye werena enough?”“My husband.” She avoided his eyes, twisting
her lips in a grimace. “Ex-husband. He
was a teacher too. Thought I couldn’t handle becoming a doctor – I should
settle to what I already was. He was very vocal about it. That’s why we
divorced.”“He was wrong.” Jamie said softly, but firmly.
His eyes were all shades of blue – stormless skies, bottomless oceans, rare
wild flowers, starry nights, infinite horizons. “I hope ye ken that. Because I
certainly do.”“Oh.” Claire babbled, feeling utterly
ridiculous after her outburst. He had his long-fingered hands placed on the
desk between them – in her eyes they seemed made to lovingly caress a female
body, to demand responses with brutal kindness, to hold a smaller hand that
could fit perfectly. “Thank you.”“It has been a pleasure teaching you, Claire.”
He said quietly. “You have a lively mind and a sharp wit. They’ll serve ye
well. Yer age won’t hinder ye, lass – it only makes ye that more intriguing and
capable.”“I’m sorry.” She gave him a weak blushing smile,
reinforced by the way he responded with a small grin. “I can be quite…rebellious, when my heels are being
stepped on.”“I have witnessed it first-hand.” He laughed,
brushing his copper hair in a display of nervousness. “Ye seem to have
forgotten one of yer wee notebooks.” And, without waiting for her answer, strode
to the place where she had been sitting, collecting her pad.She knew he would see it – she had been working
on it for most of the class and had left it open as she hurried to leave. It was
a rough drawing of a blue eye, with a familiar catlike shape – framing it was a
verse from her favourite poem in her stylized hand, “Da mi basia mille”. ”Deinde centum.”
He completed, caressing the sheet with his fingertips. “If ye’re not my student
anymore,” He said in a hoarse voice, turning to look at her with a burst of hope
in his eyes. “I’m finally free to ask ye out on a date, as I’ve wanted since
the day I first saw ye sitting on my class.”

Blue Christmas | Jamie &amp; Claire one shot a/n: Merry Christmas! I wrote this a few weeks ago, so I thought I’d finally post it. Comes in at a whopping 13,154 words so you’ll need to brew a cup of hot chocolate and settle in for this one! Now… this will probably be my last fic for awhile, possibly ever, we’ll see how I feel after everything has settled. I hope you enjoy and Merry Christmas! xx and thank you @julesbeauchamp for the moodboard! December 23rd, 2019Oxford, England The wine glass in her hand was becoming dangerously low. Dangerous, because without the warm liquid filling Claire’s belly, she’d remember just exactly why she was drinking alone. Christmas was a time of celebration and joy. A time for families to come together, laugh and exchange presents. Everyone would gather around the fireplace and tell stories or watch a classic Christmas film. Claire was celebrating in her own way two days before Christmas. Her divorce had been finalized this morning, which was a good thing, but not exactly something that would lift the spirits. Her ex-husband, Frank Randall had been a kind man, emphasis on had. They’d been married a short five years, and during that time, Frank hadn’t been faithful — at all. When Claire found out about one woman, it led to another and another… and another. Frank seemed to have a string of women lined up all around the city. It made Claire feel like a fool for trusting him and believing that he truly loved her. So, with her divorce final, Claire was celebrating Christmas alone for the first time in her life. The first several years of her life she barely remembered, and until she had married Frank, she had spent every Christmas with her aunt and uncle in London.  Keep reading

            Loss Ficlet: The First Noël        Loss Jamie and Claire’s first Christmas together –– this is only very shortly after they moved in together. Pre-engagement.  Pre-home ownership. Pre-wedding.  Pre-Buffalo Bill.  Inspired by a series of texts that I woke to from @sassenachwaffles about how she needed a Loss ficlet where Claire strips to Eartha Kitt’s version of Santa Baby. If you are not into NSFW, I think it’ll be pretty obvious to you where to stop reading. 🎄I hope this gives you a little holiday season glow.  ❤️The First NoëlDecember 2016We spent an entire weekend decking the halls of our new flat.  Still slick from a Saturday morning of lazy, prolonged, and teasing sex, Jamie announced that he had agreed to meet the Murray clan at a tree farm near Lallybroch.  The annual Fraser selection and chopping of a tree for Christmas.  In response, I confessed something that I held incredibly close to the vest. I had not had a Christmas tree since the year that my parents had died. He maneuvered me away so he could look at me from arms length. I was sure that my explanation sounded defensive, but at its core, it was defensive. Lamb and I were nomads.Bachelor pads are not conducive to Christmas decorating.It was just not that important.Rarely home, and then only a handful of nights every few months. “I canna believe ye’ve no’ had a Christmas tree since ye were… what?”“Huh?” My mind, still faltering a few steps was replaying the accident that took my parents.  (Metal and fire, blood and loss.  Imagery I gleaned from a microfiche at a university library when I was thirteen.)  I was not keeping up with him.“When yer parents died.  How old were ye?” Jamie’s brow was furrowed and I returned to his chest, nestling my face against his throat.  His skin was tacky –– sweat, musk, scented with the last moments of our joining.  Even beneath me, he was armor –– a sturdy presence to draw me back to the present.   “Five, right?”“Yeah,” I mumbled faintly, pressing my lips to the button rise of his left clavicle.  I could envision, behind closed eyes, a slim book of fragmented, greyed memories. My first four Christmases were gone. Only the scarred edges of missing pages remained.  No memories, save one (a Christmas bow, my hair in a braid, my mother’s violet perfume, sucking candy canes down to sharpened points with bits of plastic wrapping flaking off onto my tongue, and midnight mass candle smoke).  “Five.  Don’t get me wrong… Lamb was great, Jamie.  Better than great, actually. He was just not much of a traditionalist when it came to holidays.” Keep reading

 Jamie’s house to watch a movie.” I explained nonchalantly, peeking through the
 door to the living room, where my mother was watching a talent show, while
 nibbling plump strawberries. “Me and your father were
 big on cinema too…” A dramatic
 pause, as she grinned and glanced over to me. “…Just around the time I got
 pregnant.”“Hold your horses grandma,
 and don’t start any knitting extravaganza just yet.” I replied dryly,
 scrunching my nose, even as a volcanic blush crept along my neck. “We have
 been seeing each other for what - thirty seconds? Hardly prime-parent-material just yet.”“Can you imagine?” She
 continued in a dreamy voice, and I could swear falling stars shone inside her
 eyes, trailing quickly across the firmament of her imagination. “A little
 lady, with curly red-hair and amber eyes? Or a little lad, talking just like Jamie, your own duckling?”“Well, I’m going, before
 you decide the names of my future children, the schools they are to attend and
 their future careers.” I rolled my eyes, but the corners of my mouth pulled up
 on a tender smile - my heart was melting,
 just a little, when confronted with those sweet and hopeful images. “You
 were never like this with any of my previous boyfriends, though. What’s up
 with that?”“You never smiled like a fool when going out to meet them, too. A lot of firsts here.” My mother shot me a victorious look, swallowing the
 last red fruit in her bowl. “Some of them were nice young men. But I know Jamie - and he knows you. I wouldn’t trust anyone else to take care of you as
 he will, when I’m gone some day.”My chest tightened, the
 most bittersweet blend of love and preemptive longing gripping me viciously,
 and I padded to her and smacked her forehead with my lips, putting all my
 devotion in that silent kiss. “Let’s agree that those days are very far away. Who would spoil rotten
 my hypothetical children, if you weren’t around?” Keep reading

For the sake of appearances alone, Fraser’s belongings were mainly situated in Baile na Coille. He had not slept a single night under the gabled roof of the two-storyed cottage.  In reality, Colonel James Fraser (“the Queen’s Lover” as all of the nation’s newspapers - from veritable rag to legitimate press - had started to call him) had made his summer home within the same four walls as the commonwealth’s oft-maligned royal matriarch.
Beneath her duvet, his long body and his hand drawing one of her thighs between his (“ye canna be close enough as ye sleep”) before resting along the curve of her waist.
At the breakfast table, the serrated edge of his grapefruit spoon slicing through thick-skinned citrus fruits, the spritz of fruity acid hanging in the air as she read letter after letter as her fingers toyed with her earlobe.
And in the griffon-toed tub that steamed the mirrors and tile floors, her careful step as she shed the skin of a silk robe to the floor and climbed into the water with curls piled atop her head.  “Coming?” she asked, looking over her shoulder and letting out a slight sigh as she brought a second foot into the tub’s depths.  He would nod, shedding his own robe and following her, marveling at the fact that neither had to shuffle their limbs to fit.  With a toe carefully tracing the hollow lines that separated Fraser’s abdomen into pockets of muscle, Claire sank further into the bergamot-scented bath water. “Did you know that this is the only place I truly own?”
The massaging attentions of Fraser’s fingers on Claire’s calves paused for a moment.  “I hadna ever really thought about what ye own or dinna own, a nighean.”
She hummed, smirking as his eyes fixated on her big toe, which was traveling the sloped line of wiry hair beneath his navel.  “Do you know how Baile na Coille came to be?”
“Ye could use some help wi’ the pronunciation,” he commented as he shook his head.  His brows furrowed as he added, “And I’ll ask that ye move yer wee feet from that part of my anatomy.”  
Ignoring his pronunciation guidance but swiftly relocating her foot to hook behind his waist and draw him closer, she rolled her eyes.  “Queen Victoria had a lover.  She built the cottage for him, or so the story goes. All manner of lascivious scandal was born in that cottage and paid off before it passed those front gates.”
“So ye’re sayin’ that perhaps someday yer wee stables’ll become a thing of lore, too, then?”
With a well-worn shrug, Claire rose out of the water just enough to reach for the glass of lukewarm champagne resting on the windowsill next to the tub.  “Perhaps. I think what happened in London would already have gone to print if it was going to. I trust my staff here, but it is only a matter of time before the Accidental Queen and her Not-So-Accidental Lover are front-page fodder.”
He massaged a knot out of the arch of her foot, and she moaned appreciatively, finishing the last of the fizzy liquid in her flute.  “Do ye think they’ll compare me to Queen Victoria’s lovers?”
“Not sure,” she said truthfully, leaning forward as he caught the green neck of the champagne bottle to fill her glass.  “It seems an apt comparison–”
“Ye have a much bonnier arse than Queen Victoria, Queen Claire.”
If she hadn’t been utterly fatigued from their day’s worth of galavanting about the property, she would have asked him to declare as much only upon further investigation.
Neither had done much thinking about what life would be like after the declaration, when the Queen’s speech ended and tellies across Britain went dark.  While they had steeled themselves against an oncoming storm at the cabin, their arrival to Balmoral and the subsequent days had been quite ordinary, really.
They picnicked alongside a forested area and a stream, surrounded by a meadow of too-sweet butter-yellow flowers. He made her a posey of the flowers as they ate (bundle tied with the green string that had trapped their egg mayo sandwiches in brown paper). She made love to him on their tartan blanket with the bouquet discarded to the side. He wrapped the tartan around them afterward while their steeds grazed just until their hearts stopped pounding. She tapped his shoulder, suggested they should finish exploring the property. He was dressed first and folded their blanket as she hopped about bare-footed, attempting to coax her riding pants back up over her arse with her curly hair in a floating cloud about her. He felt like a fifteen-year-old boy with wanting her again.  
They walked hand-in-hand and talked about things. He wanted children, an admission hastily given with his feet catching and his body stumbling forward. Her hand found the small of his back, steadied him. When he asked, “and you?” in his slow, easy way, her response was quick, but just as easy (“of course” she wanted children with him, fingers flexing into the marred flesh just above his beltline).  
She told him that she loved Balmoral more than any other place on earth – the smell of the Highlands, the privacy, the accents of the staffers, and the way mist hung heavy even at the warmest part of the day.  
“It feels like the cabin here,” she whispered when they finally exited the bath (his lips kissing each of her pruned fingers, hands smoothing the half-soaked curls at her nape before wrapping a pre-warmed robe around her frame). 
The real world felt ten thousand miles away at Balmoral, and he traced a thumb across her cheek – a rounded, glowing place after the bath that topped off a day of exercise, sunshine, and sex. His Queen had the lightest smattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose. He stilled his thumb, kissed the dusting of pigmentation.  “Yer family cabin ‘tis a wee bit grander than my family cabin.”
She smacked his arm, making a rather serious face before dissolving into a fit of giggles when he blew a raspberry against her throat.
There came a time, after a number of weeks, when summer was giving way to autumn and their return to London was imminent.
Fraser was fitted for a number of suits with Claire sitting across the room on the floor – cross-legged and chewing on the end of a pen as she responded to some letters.  Her smattering of freckles had given way to what she called “a decidedly un-royal suntan.” It was unspoken, but he would go public in London.  As the leaves crisped with the last gasps of the season and fell to signal an oncoming winter, the nation would see him.
The man the Queen saved.  The man the Queen loved.
That night, Fraser made the offhand comment that his fitting had made him realize that her arse was fuller after weeks of decadent food. He called it her summertime arse, and vocalized no small amount of pleasure at the way she’d blushed at the declaration.  “I didna realize how well ye’d filled out this summer,” he announced, making a determined, awed kind of face and approaching her to take two handfuls of her backside. “It’s as though ye’ve reached yer natural, full-arsed state, and I couldna be happier about it.”
Had he not been pressed against her (his anatomy an urgent and quite unsophisticated lie detector), she might have taken offense.  All societal expectations of a slim queen aside, Jamie Fraser did like her just fine.  Feeling brazen, she had lowered her nightgown beneath her breasts. Voice low, she whispered, “Show me.”
Later, when they were stretched out on the duvet, and he had shown her quite fully what he meant, she whispered something that verged on a full-throated laugh: “I love that you can appreciate me at my fattest.” Her skin puckered with goosebumps at the first touch of his hands going around her hips.
“I like ye fat.  Fat and juicy as a plump wee hen.”
She purred, winding her arms around his neck.  “My summertime hen arse,” she continued, holding onto the moment. “I was thinking I would marry you in the autumn; perhaps we can hang onto it for awhile since you hold it in such high regard.  Let it fill out a wedding gown.”
His eyebrows rose, his lower lip migrating between his teeth.  “Ye want to marry me?”
“I do, yes. In a military uniform made with today’s measurements.”
“I didna ken that today was a fitting for a wedding suit.”
“Do not be an idiot,” she mumbled, sweeping an errant curl from his forehead.  His hair had been cut a little closer than was his norm, but she had made it her strictest instructions that the barber leave enough length that it would still curl.  Her voice was light, high on the moment and the enchanting power they held over one another.  “It was always part that, and this is a proposal, since you have not bothered to do it.”
“It sounds like an order – marrying ye.”  He was joking with her, eyes glittering as his hand cupped her jaw, thumb traveling an unmannered perimeter around her lips.  
“Well, do you want to marry me?”  There was not even the slightest hint of concern in her voice as she asked the question.  It was as if she knew the answer, like it was the one thing that lived freely on his carefully-guarded face.  A single syllable.  
Before he kissed her, the most elemental groan came from him.  Something of ancient stock – needy and base, just truth.  “Oh God, yes.”
And then he kissed her in a way he’d never kissed her before.  Part of her took flight then as he hitched her thigh up over his hip and leaned into her – a part with steadily-beating gossamer wings that lived beneath her breastbone, that had been carefully hatched under his care those first nights aimlessly wandering together on horseback.  A part that he had nurtured somehow despite not knowing it existed in her, but that she had tended to all along, equally unknowing. He took her firmly then, in a way that for a handful of minutes drove any tenderness of their earlier encounter in the meadow away, but was no less saturated with their love for one another. 
And when they were finished, dark having fallen and the world outside the cracked window gone silent, they were left without even the grayest, shadowiest hint of amorous intention.  Eyelids drooping with mutual pure exhaustion, they laid together, completely bared.  It was then that they somehow wound their way around a bend in their relationship.  
To talk of loss and family, of longing and fate’s plans for them in a way that they never had.  Stripped bare, they peeled back their naked skin to expose something deeper, rawer, redder, rarer.
Fraser told her in a clinical, detached way of his parents’ death.  The loss of a son that stole the very life and light from his mother’s eyes, molded her like clay into something his mam had never been before (dry hands pouring cereal into bowls with eyes fixed on the window, like she was awaiting someone to round the bend that would never come). 
The slow way his father slipped away – an undiagnosed condition that made his eye droop, his body eventually no longer cooperate in the performance of basic functions, until one day he was gone and cold in his bed in the morning (eyes open and dull-blue in their fixation on something beyond the ceiling, his fingers folded over a knit afghan in prayer).  
An economy of words described the prison camp (words he learned in German so he would never have to speak aloud in English).  The dampness of the cells, the length of the interrogations, the blood on the snow. The wounds that seeped from cracks in the flesh just above his forehead, the never-ending red stream that caked his eyelashes and made him wonder if one could feel an oncoming death.  The smell of men shitting themselves and dried vomit on ragged clothes.  The way he had slept face-down for two months after his back had been whipped into ribbons that sent red streaks of infection along his ribcage and over his shoulders.  How the second time he’d been flogged was worse, each bit of scar tissue giving way so his muscles met the air, this time the odor of infection choking him when he stripped his camp-issued shirt off.
They laid silent for a long time after that, his hand charting a course over her spine again and again and her fingers tracing the scarred etchings of war in his flesh in a way they never had before.
And then he asked her.  
So Claire told Fraser for the first time at any length about her parents and her sister.
Before that moment, there had been the natural snapshots of them in casual conversation (locations on the grounds of Balmoral taking on meaning with reference to them – her father’s study, her mother’s dressing room, her sister’s playroom; meals that reminded her of them – her mother’s favorite chicken, her father’s preferred tea, the buttery biscuits that Anne ate smeared in raspberry preserves; the bottle of perfume on her nightstand that had yellowed with age and no longer smelled sweet, but somehow still reminded her of Julia).
But this was the first graphic retelling of it.
The iciness in her veins – the frost and chill of it sucking the life out of her with each of her mother’s screams.  The taste of copper in her mouth, the breaking of her bones and the lifeless feeling of no longer gulping for air, of just waiting with the icy water in her throat and lungs.  The burning of vomiting the water again and again, her broken ribs screaming at her to just die now as she rid her body of the contents of the creek.  How the burning in her lungs and throat had eventually given away to something more primal, a need to survive.
She said their names.
Henry.  Julia.  Anne.
Claire breathed in, looking away from Fraser as she explained that she hated herself in the back of the ambulance because she was afraid she was going to die.  She did not think of them at first – of Henry, Julia, or Anne. She laid still, shivering as the navy-uniformed men tried to warm her, told her she would be okay.  She had not thought of them as she willed herself to live.
Papa.  Mum.  Oh Christ, Anne.
In the retelling of it, Claire did not cry until Fraser reached for her, touched her forearm, whispered “I’m sae sorry, Sassenach.”
She dissolved over their loss then, feeling it new and blooming beneath her breastbone.  Under his touch, she leaned into the sensation for maybe the first time in years, since well before her coronation and well before Lamb had passed.  A confession: Claire loved her papa and her mum, of course, but Anne was the one she loved the most, a feeling that made her feel sick and wrong.  “It was never supposed to be me, Jamie,” she confessed, closing her eyes as he touched her hair.  “Anne, maybe, but never me.  We played.  Toilet roll sashes and our mum’s shoes.  She was always Queen. You and me? We could have been free of all of this… gotten a flat in the city, you would not have to live like this–”
He quieted her, shook her head.  “Dinna ever think that the tragedy ye experienced, or yer job, has made me do anything that I didna want to do.  Being wi’ ye – however I can be wi’ ye – is perfect.  Ye canna pull one thread and have an entire tapestry stay the same.  I’m no’ sayin’ that yer parents died for a reason. It was senseless.  Ye canna wish away yer position for me. It’s how I found ye, and I’d ‘ave found ye somehow, but as it is now, I’m yers, Claire. It’s as it’ll be forever.  Irrevocably.  In my entirety.  And I intend to marry ye come autumn.”
She reached absently for the heavy, well-formed curl just above his temple and ran her fingertip around its circumference, thoughtful for a moment.  “I was never really one for planning a wedding, Fraser. Autumn is beautiful, but there is something about springtime. The daffodils and the lilies.  The fat bumble bees and the trees coming back to life.”
“Then springtime it is, a nighean.” 
But two weeks later, the Queen would realize that she had not had her courses in two months.
The wedding would not wait until springtime after all.

The entirety of Europe was roasting in a seemingly interminable heatwave. 
“Bloody climate change.” 
It had been our constant refrain over the preceding four-and-a-half days as we shared ice packs in bed, whined about condensation-dampened sheets, and did our damnedest not to touch one another.  
Rather than face down the prospect of sweating through another night without air conditioning and sharing a solitary oscillating fan, Jamie and I were fleeing the city to a rental cottage at the base of a mountain in the Highlands. We were both living with the vague (and perhaps vain) hope that north (anywhere, just north) would be cool enough that we wouldn’t spend the weekend learning the sensation of our internal organs roasting.
And that is how this story begins.  The story of how Jamie and I conceived our first child.

            Fanfiction - Magnificent Strangers        This fic won’t be very
long – I estimate about five chapters. If everything works out as I intended,
you’ll both laugh and be moved by it. There’s a lot of reasons why this story
feels very close to my heart and I hope you enjoy it, as I share the first
chapter from my food-induced coma this holiday. Merry Christmas! 🎄Magnificent StrangersPart I - Third CycleThere
are places where you half-expect to meet the man of your dreams: a dim
nightclub, while you dance around each other in a sweaty courtship; a Christmas
party, showered with copious amounts of expensive booze; a holiday at an
adults-only resort in Barbados,
crawling with other slightly desperate single people; a trendy pub after work
hours, eyes clashing from different corners of the room.And
then there are places where you’d never expect to meet anyone significant, much
less the love of your life. The
crowded and solemn wake of a relative, who happens to be a prominent figure in
the community. A dentist appointment, bound to leave you with two less wisdom
teeth and a swollen face for three days. A midnight impromptu trip to a
convenience store to grab sanitary towels, because your period arrived
unexpectedly, when you didn’t even bother to put on actual clothes underneath
your trench coat.  Or
a chemotherapy session, in the middle of your third treatment cycle. Today
is Chemotherapy Monday. Mondays used
to be for blues that lasted until Thursday, fishy lasagna at the canteen and
drinks with the girls. Now, Chemotherapy
Mondays are pretty much like Chemotherapy
Tuesdays and only marginally worse than Chemotherapy
Fridays. Four
months ago, I was showering after a passable nooky (with my then
beau-of-three-and-a-half-months Frank Randall), when I noticed a lump on my
right breast. It would only take two weeks to be diagnosed with stage two
breast cancer. Frank,
self-important and chivalrous (at least in his own notion of himself), promised
me we would “weather the storm
together”. His resolution, shaky like a drunken man after three days
of sobriety, lasted (surprisingly) until the day I shaved my hair. He
took one good look at me, bald and grinning, shook his head and told me he
couldn’t do it anymore. “It’s not
the hair.” Frank mumbled, as he neatly stacked a few meagre
possessions he had been leaving in my apartment into his overnight bag. “It’s the way you are always making
tasteless jokes about it all - as if everything is nothing but a punchline
waiting to happen.”“Well, don’t let me deter you.” I
went into the kitchen and filled up a generous glass of water. “I’d scream and pluck my hair out like
a proper woman scorned - but, you know.” I pointed vaguely towards my
hairless scalp and sat silently on the couch until he left. I
couldn’t tell him that humour felt closer to being alive than tears. I couldn’t
put into words that making a joke was a form of control I relished on, when
control was slowly being taken away from me. I felt like a dandelion, one
strong blow away from being scattered.  Keep reading

anonymous asked:You did the best thing you could possibly have done when you quit writing fic. No one liked it. Ok, wow, friend. First, I feel incredibly honored that you chose to include me in this laudable group. Second, how do you even know me? You’ve obviously been around here for ages because I haven’t posted a new fic in over a year. Even then I only posted 3 fics in the entirety of 2017. Did you just want to make sure that I stopped doing what I had clearly already stopped doing? A very good use of your time. Kudos. The only reason I stopped posting is because my job keeps me busy every second of the day and requires I use ALL of my creative energy at work. Like ALL OF IT. I generally don’t have anything left to put into writing fic, even though I have tons of ideas rattling around in my noggin. But you know what? Just for you, I’ll make the time. I feel a spite fic coming on. Also, I’m going to post all my old fic, just in case all the new people around here want to find out how horrible I am and join you in mocking me. We can have a party.

Jamie Fraser had room in his mind for all sorts of projects.
His hands had assembled the lumber bones into skeletons destined to become framed structures, overlaid it all with the organs and ligaments and flesh to become a home. With a saw and hammer, his capacity to create was limited only by his own supply of lumber and nails.  His love affair with making things started early (a birdhouse for his mam at age seven, hands guided by his da), and seemed to live in the space between his bones (a bad day remedied with beer, throbbing bassline, and hands that fabricated projects his mind had not yet conceived).
But this proved to be a problem.
Cooking dinner for one Claire Beauchamp, the owner-of-Leoch Manor.
And the obstacle originated from a single thought banging about in his head.  
I think I might actually like this boy.
“Focus, Fraser,” he commanded himself firmly, thumb running over a bundle of mint he had snatched from his back garden as he turned to the sauce bubbling away on the low flame of his stovetop.
Even though she wasn’t yet standing in his kitchen (barefeet, loose hair, roaming hands, and bedroom eyes), she was present everywhere.  
In the papery connective tissue under his tongue. 
In the single fingerless glove she’d left in his truck, smelling faintly of her perfume at the wristband. 
In the bloodless, pale moons rising behind the horizon of his nail bed, curving into the soft pink flesh under his fingernails. 
In the aisle of the hardware shop, a silver, faded memory like a ghost, thumbing through brushes with her head cocked to the side.
In the prickle of sweat along his hairline from the late afternoon jog he’d taken to get his mind off the thought of her looking at him over her naked shoulder in his office, whispering the contents of the text message into his throat as he hitched one English, milky thigh to his hip.

His hands, her hands, working in
such closeness to achieve a common goal – not completion of their bodies, but
wholeness to another. The way they communicated without words, with simple
glances above the rim of their masks and subtle movements of half-curved
fingers. In the operating theatre they saw each other for what they really
were; and on the nights following days of shared work, they would always seek
one another with renewed desire. Certainty.
You and I are the same. You love me as I need to be loved.Claire remembered those moments with longing, flashes of dirtied scrubs and bloody gloves, interspersed
with fragments of a walk in the park or a new book under the shelter of fresh sheets
– kids in a tent, the moon outside so
close, those centimetres of tangled bodies theirs

In possession of an achy back and glowing cheeks (a testament to the particular skills of one Dr. James Fraser, Professor of Scottish Geography, and two thorough lessons), Claire decided to take a break from the fucking-bed-and-breakfast.
Jamie was sketching a map on a piece of notebook paper.  The final destination was a “bonnie wee art gallery” that he loved. It was his first bona fide map, roughed out with a rapidly-browning apple core in his right hand and a dull pencil in the left (the perfect slant of it making Claire wonder if his mother had worked with him on his penmanship). 
As he marked an asterisk where she could find “the brawest chipper on the mainland,” Claire declared that she was quite looking forward to replacing the sun-bleached “art” collecting dust on the walls. 
Jamie concurred, starring the gallery’s location before declaring, “No offense to my Aunt Jocasta, but this place could use some art that doesna involve funeral urns filled with flowers or grouse-hunting spaniels.”  
Taking the completed map, Claire smiled at the script along the top of the page – “Claire’s Map by Jamie.”  The possibility of confusing the piece of notebook paper with its neat, masculine writing for anything else was less than zero.  Even upon her cursory review, it was a rather complete survey of the northernmost coast of Scotland’s finest gems.

            Fanfiction - Happier        I wrote this short thing for the needle wizard,
pencil sorceress and all around magnificent friend, the lovely @outlanderedandoverhere. Master
Seamstress shares with me the love for Ed Sheeran and I couldn’t resist the
urge to have her doing a happy dance over this. Enjoy! XHappierI entered the small coffee shop, unfolding my
scarf as soon as I felt the merciful warmth of the heating system, aiming
towards a quiet table at the corner, as I shook off snowflakes from my curls. As I waited for the small waitress to bring me
my cranberry scone and a large cup of steaming tea, I opened my notebook and
started reading the notes I had taken. It was a very hard case, a young patient
with a rare tumor compressing his bile duct – presenting with jaundice, looking
like the most recent character of The
Simpsons. The previous surgeon in charge of the case had announced it to be
unresectable, which gave him about three months of life expectancy. At the age
of thirty, you are seldom ready for your life to end – least of all without throwing
a good fight. And that was what I was planning to offer him –
a risky procedure, only done in the past by a handful of surgeons in the
country. If it worked, he would be cancer free – and it was my job to guarantee
it worked. I had barely slept the last couple of nights, immersed in planning
the surgery to the finest detail. I loved my job, fiercely – even in the moments
I hated it. I never lost the tingling on my palms when I held the scalpel or
the sudden feel of a jump inside my belly, like I had missed a step, whenever I
finished a hazardous procedure. Besides, it was a very welcome distraction from
the wreckage of my personal life. I sipped my tea, delighted with the smoky taste
of the Highland blend, strong and homely on the back of my tongue. It reminded
me of the taste of his skin against
my lips and I swallowed hard, slightly shaking my head to disperse unwelcome
memories. The bell above the door rang, a small tornado
of snow allowed in as new customers entered the cosy place. I bit the back of
my pencil, tilting my head to better discern an approach, as I mobilized the
invisible pancreas before me. I smiled, seeing the vessels and ducts so well
exposed in the eye of my mind, ready to be conquered, and raised my eyes to ask
for a second congratulatory scone. I saw his back but recognized him immediately –
I had kissed that spot just behind his
ear, where his hair curled at the nape, countless times. He was wearing his pilot uniform underneath his
overcoat, the flight captain’s hat placed next to his elbow on the table. I had
a sudden flash of his hands placing that hat on my head, a playful smile on his
full lips, his slightly callused hands roaming my otherwise naked body. No.Without thinking, I was already making myself
small on my table, shrinking to the point where I could almost hide under the
tasteful tablecloth – wishing I had gone to another place, in another time, in
another world. Only then I noticed he had company - a cute
blonde girl wearing stewardess clothes, her lips painted red to match the satin
scarf prettily tied around her neck in a bow. She sat in front of him on the
table, a complicit smile plastered on her face, as he talked – probably sharing
something about a recent trip. He was always coming and going, flying around
the world – I remembered all too well setting my alarm to the middle of the
night, just so I could listen to his voice in Tokyo. Kissing him goodbye – there had been so many goodbyes, not enough
hellos – before he left to New York. Texting him, unsure where in the world
he was exactly – but painfully aware it wasn’t by my side.The nights became so long, always craving,
always wondering. I felt split in two, half of myself scattered in the wind,
travelling on the air - while the other half was forced to anchor it, bearing
down, struggling with heaviness. There weren’t enough kisses to ease the
constant ache, as much as he tried – and
he had tried. “Do ye not want me
anymore?” He had
asked me on the final night, broken – Oh,
so broken. I hadn’t answered him and in my silence he took
his leave, shoulders hunched in pain. In truth, I couldn’t fathom a time when I
wouldn’t want him – and that was the problem, wasn’t it? I kept wanting and wanting and wanting, wanting so much
everything hurt, wanting so much I feared I would physically break. The flight attendant touched his hand – to my
horror he didn’t shy away from it. It lingered there, natural and possessive,
and I felt the scone doing cartwheels inside my stomach like a flour acrobat. She leaned over and told him something,
slightly sticking her tongue out in mischief and he laughed. Throat and lungs
and vocal chords, clapping and singing, an orchestra on a perfect rendition of
amusement. Standing ovation from the crowd. Claire Beauchamp dead in the
audience. He used to laugh like that with me. Jamie
always laughed with his entire body. He was that kind of man – whole in
everything he did. I recalled the sensation of his laugh as I laid my cheek on
his chest, a scientist studying the mechanisms of happiness. For a moment I
closed my eyes and covered them with my hand, foolishly disturbed by the
realization I didn’t hold his laughter in exclusiveness. Jamie looked happy. I could see the outline of
his smile, the corners of his mouth turned up in contentment. Had he been that
happy with me, once? Before I filled our lives with insecurities, demands and frailties?
She squeezed his hand – fingers touching, skin
meeting, hearts melting? - and got up, putting on her elegant coat. With a
swish of blonde hair, she kissed his cheek – clearly no amiable kiss demanded
such duration, in my opinion – and with a light caress on his forehead, left
him finally alone. He looked around, searching for the waitress to
ask for a refill and – of course – spotted me. It was like standing on stage,
two spotlights beaming on us, everything else left in darkness. Jamie glanced
at me and I proudly endured his gaze, asserting that I saw his happiness and
wasn’t shaken at all by it. Liar.  Slowly I
made my way to his table, a slug crawling on a lettuce leaf, ugly but brave. I
seemed to be ken on eating every crumb of my cake of sorrow and then smile,
pretending it was sweet. “Hello, Jamie.” I greeted him, bracing myself
on the notebook I carried. His hair was somewhat shorter than the last time I
had seen him, a couple of months ago, his uniform impeccable, the tie on his
neck just a bit loose. I used to make his knots and suddenly panicked, fearing
that the blonde girl was a master of turns and twists, able of fixing his heart
as well as his tie. “Hello, Claire.” Jamie replied, his voice
cautious. “How are ye?”“Good.” I smiled nervously. “Are you back from
work?”“Aye.” He fidgeted with the mug in front of
him, a soft hesitant smile on his lips. “Just got back from Brazil. It was a
wee furnace there.”“Ah.” I swallowed hard, struggling to come up
with other pleasantries I could share with him. Do you smile in your sleep when she touches you? “You look good.
Happy.”“What are ye asking me, Claire?” He avoided my
gaze, his face abruptly serious. “Nothing.” I replied in a hoarse voice, well
aware that he could spot the tears forming on the corners of my eyes, in the
fountains of my soul. “Just that. You looked happy with her.”“She’s a good lass.” He glared at me, his eyes
outrageously blue and intent. “She understands what life is for me. I feel that
I can talk to her.”“As you couldn’t talk to me?” I tried to smile
again and failed miserably, the glass of my face polished and glistening,
reflecting the thousands of small sorrows hidden in the corners of my eyes. “I told ye all my soul and heart.” Jamie
lowered his eyes, grabbing his hat. “In the end it wasna enough. That is my utmost
regret, Claire - that it wasna enough.”I stood there, speechless, as he gathered his
things and left. I thought of the bleeders that elude the most capable surgeon,
the cardiac arrest that lasts forever, the hands inside where we are most
private, touching the core of what we are, unable to reach what had been lost.
I slammed my heart at him as he closed the door behind him – “Jamie!” – knowing all too well I had no
one to blame but myself. I had traded all for nothing, convinced it was a
worthy bargain – blind, blind, fool.I crawled home, shaken to the very marrow of my
bones, oozing love and loss – sticky and queasy with it. In medical school they
had told me how the brain works to protect itself – the clever barrier
surrounding it, the plasticity, the temperature regulation – and yet my brain
seemed decided to finish me, incessantly playing memories of Jamie, smacking me
with my own recklessness. I had no self-preservation left, for I loved him to
the atoms of me.I had seen him happy without me – there was joy
there to be sure, in knowing him well. But the pain was almost unbearable, no
last redoubt of magical thinking left, where I could hide and pretend we would
find our way back to each other. He was
gone. Pushed away by my own two hands. I collapsed on the couch, curling into fetal
position, making myself small and smaller. My ears were filled with the sounds
of my own heart and I willed him to stop, to let go of beating, to be still and
let me be. He kissed my cheek on
our first date. I kissed his lips on the second. Loved all of himself by the
tenth. My heart leapt when I saw him, tall and gallant in his uniform, almost
running to hold me in his arms at the hospital. When he told me flying was his
second favourite thing. When he told me I was first. Red Jamie, my Jamie. A knock on the door, fast and rhythmed. A
secret code for the lover coming. I padded to the door, afraid and wanting. Hopeful. I opened the door and he was standing there,
snowflakes turning into rivers on the brim of his hat. He reached out with his
hand and I took it, already knowing I’d never let go again. “I was happier with ye.” He whispered in a
husky voice. And I remembered it all, the happiness and love I’d known, waiting
in him as kisses on his lips.
