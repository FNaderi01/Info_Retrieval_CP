        Atlassian CLI
This program is an easy-to-use, scriptable API for interacting with JIRA (and
eventually other Atlassian products) via the REST API.
Whenever possible, this CLI will implement a "pure JSON" option for input and
output, allowing maximum machine-parsability.  RecordStream is a huge potential
candidate for using with the atlas-cli.
Usage
SYNOPSIS
atlas-jira-cli --help # for full help page
atlas-jira-cli jql "assignee = someuser and project = QA and created &gt; -1d"
atlas-jira-cli view QA-1234
atlas-jira-cli transition QA-1234 --editState close
atlas-jira-cli edit QA-1234 --fix-versions='+1.1.1' --fix-versions='-1.1.0' --comment "bumping to a later release"
atlas-jira-cli comment QA-1234 --comment "This is harder than I thought!"
atlas-jira-cli create --project-key QA --summary "File all the tickets!" \
        --description "Meme of the year, amirite?" \
        --priority p1 \
        --components regression \
        --affects-versions 1.0.0 \
        --affects-versions 1.1.0 \
        --fix-versions 1.1.1
Setting up with RVM
Since atlassian-cli requries a custom version of the terminal-table gem, it must always be executed with bundle exec.
To set this up, it is advised you do the following:
rvm install ruby # if not already done, will grab newest c-ruby
rvm use ruby@atlascli --create
gem install bundler # may be needed
bundle install
# create a bash script in your path, obviously adjust the paths to point to
# your rvm directory and your checkout of atlassian-cli
#!/bin/bash
ATLAS_CLI_DIR=/home/$USER/gitrepos/atlassian-cli
RVM_DIR=/home/$USER/.rvm
GEMSET=ruby-2.0.0-p195@atlascli
cd $ATLAS_CLI_DIR &amp;&amp; $RVM_DIR/bin/$GEMSET -S bundle exec $ATLAS_CLI_DIR/bin/atlas-jira-cli "$@"
# you may also have to run this once for each ruby to generate the stubs, depending on your rvm version:
rvm wrapper ruby@atlascli
Authentication
Initially, the script will prompt for a username and a password.  If you don't
want to type it in every time you can store credentials in your ~/.netrc file
using the standard format (see man netrc for details).
DEV GUIDE
To run an instance of jira for testing using the atlassian plugin sdk
atlas-run-standalone --server localhost --product jira --version 5.2.11
Note that you have to create the project and some issues first... intial db is empty.
To hit an endpoint using curl, for example:
curl --user admin:admin 'http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/api/2/search?jql=project%3Dfoo'
TODO
There are many things I'd eventually like to implement.  For now, they are
broken up by product.
BUGS
Create new issue with no component/type, try to edit it, profit?
JIRA
fix transition to also update fields, etc, current ignores all but comment
Create Components
Support converting regular issues to sub-tasks (blocked by https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-27893)
Move issue (also not supported by the rest API: https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/132846/how-move-issue-to-another-project-via-rest-api)
JQL Query Pagination
list components, priorities, assignees, etc.
issue labels
Selectively get only fields we need (PERF)
Clean up regex based things (allow exact match, --dry-run, specify by ID, etc)
Extract more hashifiers (for comments, etc) for better code reuse
A way to query required fields
Confluence
Fetch raw page, upload raw page
vim/emacs integration
Stash
Search for projects/repositories
Search for pull requests
Create pull request
Permissions admin?
Generic
Support using a session cookie to cache credentials (p0, otherwise the CLI puts undue load on crowd/ldap)
TEST COVERAGE
Implement oauth support?
Support mac OSX keychain?
Bamboo
Search / list builds
Trigger builds
Fetch artifacts / logs
Crowd
Test auth credentials
Administration?
