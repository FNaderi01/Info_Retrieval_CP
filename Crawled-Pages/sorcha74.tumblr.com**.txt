Cait is oblivious looking radiant, parking her hands on somewhere that must not be named! But I think it’s pretty obvious here so much so for Sam to look really alarmed!

Sam looking very protective of his wife and ready to get her outta there.Adding another photo from around the same time where she also looks to be expecting...and w similar arm pose and loose fitting patterned dress. Also, has a gold band on display...🤔

I’m back with a new ficlet for your smutty holiday-reading pleasure, as part of the Winter of Want challenge with my dear friends, betas, and partners in crime @desperationandgin​ and @missclairebelle​My deepest thanks also to @fierceweebadger​ for the gorgeous moodboard, and for the beta services!This ficlet is a follow-up to my modern day AU oneshot in which both Jamie and Claire are both pilots, called Out of the Clear Blue Sky, which you can read herePlease be advised that both the original story and this Christmas oneshot are very appropriately rated E for explicit sexual content!Merry Christmas, y’all!I was awake in the fraction of a second between my white noise app cutting out and the initiation of the dull, thrumming pulse of the Facetime ring. Over the past six weeks, that sound had become both the highlight of my day and the bane of my existence; my wake-up call to a morning of cold sheets instead of Jamie Fraser, but a chance to at least see him, talk to him on the days when we couldn’t be together. I had my thumb hovering over the green answer button just as Jamie’s sleepy-smiled, mussed-haired picture popped up on my mobile. No matter how many times I saw it, I couldn’t help but smile at my screen. He’d given a pained grimace when he first saw my photo choice, trying to snatch my mobile from my hands with an emphatic “surely ye have more flatterin’ pictures of me on yer camera roll than that, Sassenach?” Heavy-limbed with satisfaction and blissfully happy, I’d been brave enough in that moment to tell my newly-official-boyfriend the truth: that this was the way I liked to think of him, the way I missed him the most when we were apart. Drenched in morning sunlight, rolling over to face me with a pillow-lined face and a tender smile. I’d snapped this particular photo in just such a moment, and immediately assigned it to his contact in my mobile. And it was staying there permanently, I’d told him, whether he liked it or not.His vengeance had been swift and fierce. As I answered, I shifted my hips to ease the warm ache building between my legs at the mere memory of what he’d done to me in retribution.The live-streamed face that replaced his picture was bright as a daisy; naturally, he was already dressed and ready for the day. It was five o’clock in the bloody morning for him, and he’d already been to the gym for a workout, I was sure. He was freshly showered and shaved, damp auburn hair curling around his ears and at the nape of his neck. Suffice to say Captain James Fraser was a morning person, and a cheerful one.I… was decidedly neither.“Good morning, starshine,” he singsonged in a low, teasing voice. “The earth says hello.”I buried my smile in my pillow with a groan.“Up ye get, Sassenach.” “Nn-nnhn,” I grunted.“Yes-hnh,” he insisted. “Ye ken what today is, don’t ye?” “Monday,” I responded cheekily, mouth still muffled by the pillow.“Aye, Monday,” he agreed with one last nip of sarcasm before his features softened. “Happy Christmas, mo nighean donn.”I turned my face to look at him then, my own smile gentling. “Happy Christmas,” I whispered. I thought for a moment, quirked an eyebrow, then added, “Christmas Eve, that is.”Keep reading…

Dropping his “Sassenach Tartan” the same day as her movie premiere and new charity campaign? Dick move. As the favorite in this fandom and arguably the more we’ll known of the two, this reeks of insecurity.

                                                            Timing sucks big time. For this to be a SM team move he would have needed to draw all that gathered attention towards her movie, taking advantage of the momentum but… I see nothing in that direction. On the contrary, going by his SM yesterday it was all about him and how SH loves and likes SH. Total douche move. Her movie premiere is just the one day. He has all the other days available to choose for his news release. Dick, dick, dick.

Only thing is.........looks like it’s actually still on her finger. So, I take all rings off when I put hand lotion on...so this seems to be easily explained to me but I’m sure there is any number of reasons.

                                                                    GLASS Magazine | Caitriona Balfe | Autumn Issue 2019Irish actor Caitriona Balfe has conquered the catwalk, is one of TV’s most beloved heroines, and now is set to take over the silver screen. She speaks to Glass about migraines, Muppets, and her upcoming film, Le Mans 66.When I say that Caitriona Balfe’s life story sounds like a work of fiction, in no way do I mean that the way she’s lived seems fantastical. Quite the contrary — it just doesn’t sound like real life. It’s more like the prologue to an early noughties date movie that has the following narrative: “Small-town girl with big dreams is picked up by a modelling scout while doing charity work and whisked off to the Paris catwalks. After working her way to the top, she’s scammed by a crooked agent - things look bleak. Will she every make it to Hollywood?”You know the rest. Speaking to 39-year-old Balfe on the phone, it quickly becomes apparent that she has no intention of discouraging my suspicion that she is, in fact, a fictional creation — her childhood — she was raised in Tydavnet, a very small village in County Monaghan, Ireland — is impossibly endearing.“It’s funny because I grew up without a TV… just a decision my parents made. See, I used to get a lot of migraines as a kid, so I would take a lot of days off… When I finally got a TV, I remember lying on the couch watching these movies when I should have been at school, but was too ill to be there. I remember really falling in love with these British films from the 1940s, they were what made me fall in love with film and acting,” she explains.Fortunately the migraines cycled out, but her passion for period pieces remains intact. Balfe made her big screen debut in J. J. Abrams’ 1980s nostalgia-fest Super 8 (2011) — a shot of her legs in 2006′s The Devil Wears Prada doesn’t count — and she’s been the face of much-loved-genre-bending Outlander (1946-1743 — extra points for era juggling) since 2014. Next up is Le Mans 66, James Mangold’s retelling of the Ford vs. Ferrari battle for automobile supremacy, set in… 1966.“The new film is something I’ve very proud of. Working with Christian Bale has been one of the absolute highlights of my life, and also with Jim Mangold, who’s a director I have such admiration for… you know? These are things that are huge for me,” Balfe says. “I grew up watching Christian, and it was so much fun working with him. I feel we had such a great connection, and we were able to get through our scenes in such a beautiful way.”Alongside Balfe and Bale is another Hollywood heavyweight — Matt Damon. “It was so incredible watching Christian and Matt and the way that they have very, very different approaches in their acting style, both sort of getting to the same place. But coming at it from different angles. Christian stays in the Birmingham accent the whole time, and he stays in that physicality the whole time… that’s his way. Whereas Matt is Matt up until the moment they say ‘action’, and then it switches.”There’s a certain wide-eyed innocence in Balfe’s voice as she talks about her co-star, another endearing quality. She came to acting relatively late, and was already into her thirties when she finally got her break in Super 8, yet it’s clear that she feels this is just the beginning. “When I started out, all I would hear is, ‘you’re perfect for the brunette role,’ and I replied, ‘what does that mean?’ I guess it’s sort of like: a smart brunette, who tells people what to do? God knows! So, it’s been quite a nice surprise getting to work on more obscure things like Dark Crystal. It has that kind of intense fandom which is so interesting to be part of. It’s sort of the equivalent of people following their favourite football teams, which they live or die for their entire lives. It’s a really special thing to be a part of.”The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance is Balfe’s live action debut. She stars as a Gelfling warrior (a race of elf-like creatures native to the planet of Thra, part of the Muppet Universe), named Tavra, as part of arguably the most stacked cast of the year.As she prepares to mark another first with this entrée, it’s worth remembering that her initial film credit wasn’t actually an acting role, rather an appearance “as herself” in her good friend and fellow model Sara Ziff’s 2009 documentary, Picture Me: A Model’s Diary. It was an inside look at what life is really like for a working model. “I suppose [Picture Me] was a precursor to a lot of the Time’s Up work that’s going on right now; we were both models in an industry that was rife with sexual harassment.”While she’s no longer part of the fashion industry, Balfe continues to work with her friend as part of Ziff’s Model Alliance — an organization formed to advocate for workplace equality and the eradication of sexual harassment in the fashion industry. “Sara really started [Model Alliance] as a way to give protection to certain girls working in the industry who were completely unprotected. I always try to stand up and speak up for people who don’t have a voice. As one of the older models, even though I was only 19, I remember being in Japan with girls who were 17 and being told not to eat, or sent to casting with people that were pretty dubious…
I guess in a way, I’ve always taken on that role of trying to look after and protect these girls.”
There’s also the time that Balfe was denied $300,000 worth of wages accrued over the 2002 and 2003 seasons in Milan after her Italian agency went under, hijacking its clients’ earnings in the process. “There was a lot of inequality and abuse, whether it be physical, sexual, or financial,” she comments.Like Ziff, Balfe is open to the possibility of stepping behind the camera. “I would love to. You know, one of the benefits of being on a TV show for as long as I have is I have so many hours of watching different directors, watching the different approaches to what they do… what works and what doesn’t, you know? It’s been such an incredible learning experience. As an actor you’re limited to the stories you can tell, but I think if you can direct or produce, you’re able to tell a much wider variety of stories.”Until she takes on that mantle herself, there’s one name that Balfe would love to have on her CV. “I mean there’s so many people I’d love to work with, but one director in particular would have to be Andrew Haigh. I am obsessed with his films. Lean on Pete, 45 Years,…” At this point she catches herself, as if wary of becoming too enveloped in the dream and tails off. Back on the couch, home from school, and perhaps in need of a reminder that for all intents and purposes, she’s “made it”. “I’m at the beginning, you know? Anyone who wants to work with me is great.”[thank you to Portal Caitriona Balfe on Twitter for the two article scans!][thank you to DianeB31 on Twitter for the front page scan!]
