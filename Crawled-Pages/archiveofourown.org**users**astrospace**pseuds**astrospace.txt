    Summary
      Peter didn’t mean to become the alpha, Derek had never meant to come back to Beacon Hills, and Stiles hadn’t meant to become a werewolf. Just because you don’t mean for something to happen doesn’t mean it’s not something good. Sometimes the things we think are the worst possible scenario end up being the best things to happen to us. Maybe, just maybe, these things were actually meant to be. A season 1 AU starting from episode 9, ‘Wolf’s Bane’ where Peter bites Stiles that night in the hospital. This starts a chain reaction of events that leads to everything playing out very differently than canon. Peter learns how to be a better alpha, Derek learns how to let people back into his life and Stiles finds out what pack can really mean.

    Summary
      Thomas lays Newt down on the ground gently, careful not to hurt him any more than he already has. Newt is looking up at him, and the first thing Thomas notices are his eyes: once black and bloodshot, now fading back to a familiar, warm brown. The darkened veins all over his face and neck also seem to be losing their bizarre color, slowly but surely.Thomas and Brenda are leaning over him, watching a miracle unfold before their very eyes.(Update, October 6th: I added a scene at the end of chapter 8 because I just cannot move on lol)

    Summary
      Scott McCall hadn't seen his best friend in over a year. Not since they fought the Nogitsune, not since Allison died, not since Void Stiles disappeared and took the real Stiles with him. Now, an entire year later, Scott wasn't sure if he wanted to find whatever Stiles had turned into. But he knew he had to, he owed it to him. A part of him didn't believe it anymore, with every wrong clue, every trail that led nowhere, he lost hope that he'd ever find out what happened to Stiles. That is until Chris Argent told him about a hunter collective called Wicked who kidnapped supernatural teens to experiment on them and about the Nogitsune they claimed to have. Could this be it? Could that be the lead they had all been looking for? Could it be that Stiles had been alive this whole time, held prisoner by hunters? And if yes, if they really found him, what state would he be in?{Teen wolf / Maze runner crossover}
