stop calling me daddy (social media AU)Convo 6Warnings; none I think? Maybe a bit jealousy in here..Steve rolled his eyes, as he exited the chat and went towards his chat with Y/N.Steve thought it was a good idea. Surely the other’s won’t mind, but somehow Steve thinks Bucky and Nat are going to be a problem.Nat’s definitely going to breath down her neck, ask her a shit load of questions and Bucky…Well, Steve never punched him in his life and he doesn’t want to make this Bucky’s first.When Steve saw how her door was a bit beaten up, he knew something was wrong. He planted a device in her dorm, making sure there were no intruders coming in and he knew she would be safe… But not safe enough.He just hoped this Jake guy is no trouble to them, god knows what Steve would do if he did..“I’m a little nervous, but I’m actually a little excited… Well, mostly I’m going to meet Bucky…” Y/N was holding her laughter when she noticed how tensed Steve became, but he remained quiet, his jaw was clenched and she could tell that he was really pissed. “Maybe a threesome?”“Listen, if you don’t shut your mouth I will do a lot of stuff to you when we get to our room” His voice was stern, and stern Steve was Y/N’s favorite Steve. She just giggled, biting her lips as she planned the day ahead of her.Making sure Steve was jealous was one of them.“Okay, here’s a few rundowns of the team. Nat’s going to be asking a lot of questions, maybe personal ones. Tony is going to make a lot of his dumb witty jokes about our relationship, and how young you are. Vision, well… Vision is Vision. Wanda, she’s the most tolerable in the team… Maybe you can be friends with her, she’s close to your age and Sam, well… Sam is a good man, he’s fine”“What about Bucky?”Y/N wanted to laugh, but she kept a straight face.“The guy’s is my best friend, but I would bite his tongue off if he tries anything with you”“You’re such a cute boyfriend…”It was the first time Y/N had confirmed their relationship and Steve couldn’t deny he didn’t feel his heart skip a beat when she called him her boyfriend.“You’re my best girl… Wouldn’t want anyone to take you away from me, princess”.Surprisingly everything Steve said about the team was all correct.Natasha was studying her like a book, making sure she’s not betraying Steve or using him. It was honestly sweet and Y/N could tell they were really close together.Tony’s jokes were funny, really funny. You enjoyed being around him because he had the most sense of humor out of everyone.Sam and Wanda were fine, they were good people.Vision, however, creep her the hell out. He kept staring at her and didn’t say a word. Maybe he was just shy.Bucky…“I knew you were a cutie…” She didn’t even have to turn around and she already knew who it was. The subtle hint of the Brooklyn accent laced his voice, which was calm and low. “Turn around, doll… Wanna get a good look at you”Now, in Y/N’s list of Avengers she wanted to fuck. Bucky was second.It goes.SteveBuckyThorLoki (He’s a villain, but Y/N heard somewhere he had redeemed himself)She didn’t want to be as flustered as she was right now, but Bucky was just so damn captivating. This was basically cheating, Y/N needed to get away from him fast.“Relax… Steve’s my buddy, would never do anything to hurt him… It was nice meeting you, Y/N” Luckily, Bucky’s voice changed immediately and that made her a little calmer. She took Bucky’s hand and shook it firmly.Y/N was scared to be intrusive among these superheroes but surprisingly, each and every one of them made it feel like she was accepted and she was kind of happy to be here.Steve was surrounded by great people and Y/N was grateful to be with someone like him. Thank God he texted the wrong number that day, or else she wouldn’t have met him.

request: winwin maybe being like a really cute soft guy till he gets pissed off or jealous or frustrated and he goes like full dom modewinwin was the sweetest boyfriend anyone could have. he always cared so much for youand was super affectionate, even around his members. he would always have a big smile onhis face every time he looked at you and his hands were constantly on you. you loved theway he would kiss your cheek or would wrap his arms around you, hugging you from behindwhile his head rested on your shoulder and you could feel the warmth of his breath on yourneck. he always treated you as the most precious thing in the world and that’s why you werecaught by surprise when, while you were in the middle of a conversation with kun, winwincalled you to meet him in the bedroom where he immediately pushed you against the wall assoon as the door closed.“you thought it was funny to expose yourself like that to kun?” his expression was serious,both of his hands on either side of your head, his body hovering over yours.“w-what are you talking about?” you asked hesitantly, still shocked with the way he wasacting.“when you were sitting next to him. your skirt was so far up your thighs that i could almostsee your panties. and i bet kun was dying for that to happen, he kept staring at your legs.”your eyes were locked with his and you could see them becoming darker and somehow hewas able to look even more attractive than what he already was.“i-i didn’t notice. i’m sorry.” your words were almost inaudible due to how intimidated youwere by this new persona.his hand grabbed your jaw and your eyes widened. “don’t lie to me, baby. i can see the wayyou act around kun. always so close to him, always laughing at his jokes, taking anyopportunity you get to touch him and i just know you love the way he looks at you.” youcouldn’t lie, seeing winwin jealous and manhandling you was one of the hottest sights to everexist and you could feel your panties getting wet by the second. “you love the attention hegives you, don’t you?” the only thing you could do was stare at him with a guilty look on yourface as you rubbed your thighs together and you heard winwin chuckle. “you’re so slutty. areyou getting wet just from this, hm?”the hand that was on your jaw moved down to cup your pussy under your skirt and yourfingers automatically wrapped around his wrist, closing your eyes in pleasure. “hmm, you’resoaking. were you already like this when you were talking to kun?” you looked down at thefloor, your cheeks gaining a light tint of pink as you thought about your answer.“yes, a-a little bit.” you almost whispered and before you could comprehend what was goingon, winwin was already dragging you by your arm, bending you over the edge of the bed.you suddenly felt a hard smack to your ass, making you jerk forward, your fingers holdingthe sheets tightly.“i think you need to be reminded who you belong to.” he lifted your skirt around your waist,exposing your ass and stained panties to him, feeling another smack on your ass and thistime you couldn’t hold your whimper in. he smacked you a few more times, only beingsatisfied when his handprint was visible on you. you felt the weight of his body on your backand then his lips pressing against your neck, his hand coming up to wrap around your throat,lifting your head slightly.“i’m going to fuck you so hard that everytime you look at kun the only thing that will come toyour mind is how good my cock feels inside you.” he said between gritted teeth, his lipsgrazing your ear, making you shiver and you whimpered at his words. he stood up again andpulled your panties down your legs, rubbing his fingers between your wet folds before takingoff his own pants, stroking his cock and pressing the tip of it against your entrance and before you could process everything he was already slamming his cock inside you, givingyou no time to adjust, his thrusts fast from the beginning. you sank your face in the mattresstrying to muffle your moans as you grabbed tightly at the sheets.“oh no no no, baby.” one of his hands came up to grab your hair in his fist, pulling your headback. “your gonna let everyone know who’s fucking you this good.” his other hand grabbedtightly at your hip, probably leaving bruises at this point, the sound of skin slapping togetherand your moans filling the room. he pulled on your hair harder, making you get up to pressyour back against his chest, his lips getting closer to your ear. “who do you belong to?”“you. i belong to you.” you whined as you felt the tip of his cock rub against your g-spot fromthe new position.“are you still thinking about kun?” he groaned into your neck, nibbling at the skin and yourarms reached back, trying to grab onto him. “no” you simply said and he let go of your hair,pushing you to the mattress again. “didn’t think so.” both of his hands grabbed your hips, histhrusts getting deeper and faster and the pleasure you were feeling was so overwhelmingthat you couldn’t hold back any of your moans and you were pretty sure that everyone in theliving room had already heard you and that thought only made you more aroused, the tinglyfeeling in your stomach growing bigger.“you better scream my name when you cum, you hear me?” you could notice in his voicehow close he was getting to orgasm and so were you, so when winwin started to circle yourclit with his fingers you couldn’t hold it in anymore and you came around his cock so hardthat when you moaned his name it sounded more like a scream and you’re cheeksautomatically became redder with embarrassment but the way you moaned his name waswhat pushed winwin to his own orgasm, his cum filling you up, warm against your walls.he got off of you and you rolled around in the bed, laying on your back, exhausted. you onlynoticed that winwin was gone for a second when he came back with a warm wet towel toclean you up and his caring self was back, his touch gentle once again.“i didn’t know you were like this, sicheng.” you smiled at him and he hovered over you,kissing your lips softly.“i don’t like when people touch what is mine.”

anonymous asked:22 and/or 24 for the prompt thing!	“What the fuck is this person saying that the fucking meat wasn’t fucking tender?” Bucky yells, crumpling up the newspaper and throwing it straight into the trashcan where it belongs. Then he grabs it again, straightens it out, and reads the review again, fuming.	“It was one line of an otherwise glowing review,” Natasha says, crossing her arms over her chest. “Take it, move on. We don’t need you to get caught up on this.”	Bucky rolled his eyes, then looked back down at the article. It would be hard to track down the person who wrote the review, but he could do it. He’s done more difficult things before.— —	 Steve is trying to choose the perfect pork chop when someone bumps into his side. “Sorry,” he says reflexively, reaching out to steady the person. 	“No, I’m sorry,” the guy says and wow, he’s a looker. He’s a little bit shorter than Steve himself is, with blue eyes and soft black hair that Steve wants to reach out and touch. “Looking for some chops?”	Steve nods. “Yeah, just trying a new recipe for dinner.”	“Something good?”	“Sounds like it. Involves a lot of apple cider and more work than I should be putting into dinner for one.”	The man smiles. “Wanna make it dinner for two, instead?”	Steve does.— —	“So what did you say you do?” Bucky asks later that night. They’re in his apartment, since Bucky is a professional chef, though he neglected to tell Steve where he works. All the better, Steve thinks, since he won’t have to feel like it’s a conflict of interest if he ever has to review his restaurant. At least he can eat eas knowing that he hasn’t reviewed the restaurant with a chef named Bucky — he’d remember that. 	“I’m a journalist.” It’s not technically a lie.	Bucky smiles. “Sounds like a fun job. Gotta send me some of your articles.”	Steve shrugs and asks for more potatoes.— —	“You’re happy,” Natasha says one afternoon as Bucky preps the night’s fish.	“I’m getting laid,” he says. 	“That was apparent. Who is it?” He smirks at her. Her eyes go wide. “No,” she says.	“I’m nothing if not persistent.”	“Is this just to get him to eat a steak?” she asks.	Bucky pauses, knife hovering over the red snapper. Honestly? No. Not anymore, at least. He’s not sure when it happened… Well, if he’s being honest, it happened between dinner and dessert on their first date. But Steve is more than a perfectly tender medium rare steak to him.	“Did I just send you into an emotional crisis?” she asks.	“Maybe,” he concedes, then continues to cut the fish.— —	“I wanted to do something special,” Steve says, uncovering Bucky’s eyes. “Happy four month anniversary.”	He looks out over the spread and it looks good, if he can toot his own horn. The steaks are beautiful, the potatoes creamy. The candles are lit and the napkins are folded. In the kitchen, there’s a beautiful fruit tart that he spent hours agonizing over, making sure every piece of kiwi was just perfect. Even if he writes for a living, he can’t quite find the words to express how he feels about Bucky. (It’s love, his mind tells him, but he can’t say it.) So he hopes that a great dinner will at least get across what he wants to say.	Bucky just stares at the table. Steve gets nervous. “Is everything okay?” he asks.	“Is that steak?” he asks, voice cracking.	“Yeah, it’s New York strip. Is that okay? Do you not eat steak?” Jesus, he should’ve asked!	“No, I…” He trails off, then looks at Steve and says, “I swear to God that better be the most tender steak I have eaten, so help me God.”	Steve just blinks.	It turns out that both of them had a secret.— —	Steve’s pissed until he’s not. But he also decides that they won’t be serving steak at their wedding.

anonymous asked:Hi I'm so sorry but I completely forgot weather or not I requested this from you already or not if I did just delete this please hahahhaha anyways. could I request a bakugo × chubby!insecure reader and its starts off with angst from her being bullied about it and ends in fluff And happiness. I'm sorry if I sent this twice I just genuinely can't remember and also feel free to add anyone you like to this if you want tysm!You hadn’t sent it dear, it’s okay! I’m sorry for the delay, I’ve been awful at writing scenarios lately, but I hope you like this! &lt;3Katsuki first started to notice the little changes in your attitude when you showed up to a date one day, wearing your sleeves a bit longer than usual and looking down, refusing to even grab his hands as he knew you liked to do. He said nothing as he looked for your touch anyways and when you shyly complied he noticed the bright blush that tinted your cheeks and the pout on your lips, but he thought it was only because of him and held you tightly as you walked together to your favourite fast food place.The worry that something could be happening when you were away from him at your own school appeared on his mind when he picked you up a Saturday afternoon after some supplementary classes you had - you almost ran off the place and threw yourself into his arms, your eyes red and puffy but he wouldn’t push the subject, instead choosing to walk away as fast as he could to get you somewhere you’d feel more comfortable. You were shaking when you hugged him, and it infuriated him to think someone could be doing something bad to you.It wasn’t until the first time he visited your house that he decided to take matters into his own hands; he was just sitting in your bed, waiting for you to get changed at your bathroom when your phone buzzed on top of the bed. Katsuki wasn’t one to pry on your privacy but the constant vibrations annoyed him greatly and prompted him to sit up and grab it, ready to tell whoever was bothering your afternoon together to piss off when he read the ongoing chain of messages coming from someone saved only as Nina.He could’ve assumed it was one of your girl friends by the way you seemed to know her and that she seemed to be aware of his presence at your house, but the way she referred to you as ‘miss Piggy’ and referred to him as a ‘farmer who took care of a pig and only settled’ for you made him feel sick to his stomach. As he heard you calling out to him from the other side of the bathroom door, asking if everything was okay as he was really quiet, he just said, “It’s all good - hurry up and come back here so I can can cuddle the shit out of you.” Quickly tapping on your phone, he opened the camera and took a selfie with his middle finger up and the most conceited smile he could make, sending it to the girl with the simple caption, ‘This fucking farmer will kick your ass if you don’t stop already.’Katsuki sent it just as you came back to your bedroom, a horrified expression appearing on your face as you noticed he had your phone on his hands, but he just looked at you with anger. He knew very well that he could be persuasive if he wanted it, and that was one of the times he was decided to get his way. “What are you doing?” you asked slowly, crossing your arms in an attempt to seem intimidating despite the fear on your face, but he wasn’t going to be swayed by it - he never was. “T-that’s mine, Katsuki.”“And you’re mine and I should know if something’s bothering you, don’t you think? We’re not really playing by the fucking rules here.” While he didn’t want to be overly abrasive with the way he talked to you, he did feel like you needed to understand that he was worried, and that was the only way he could speak his mind properly. “So, are you going to tell me about this Nina thing? Were you ever going to let me know?”You looked away, clearly embarrassed - his own mind was racing with the different things that could’ve been said to you during the time you were together, or even before because he was sure it wasn’t a new problem you had to deal with. “It’s nothing you could change,” you said with your shoulders down and looking defeated, turning your attention back to him with teary eyes and a sad smile. “It has nothing to do with you, really; it’s just me, and this stupid body of mine. It’s been like that for years, and even if I tried to lose a bit of weight they’d still go on about how… I’m a pig, how no one would love me and if I ever found someone to be with me I’d crush them with my body.”Walking towards the bed, you sat next to him but refused to meet his gaze; he had to stop himself from pinning you down and showering you with kisses and compliments, understanding you still needed to get things out of your system. “And how do they know about me?” he asked, wondering if he really wanted to know.“They saw a few pictures when one of them stole my phone for the day,” you explained. “They tried to question me and thought I was lying when I said you attend Yuuei - it was the first time I’ve been pushed so hard against a wall.” His face contorted into an unreadable expression, rage filling his every fiber as he listened to you, but that was the cherry on top of everything else. “It hasn’t happened against since then, but they don’t miss the chance to tell me that I don’t deserve someone as good as you. Maybe they’re right.”Grabbing your arm he pulled you towards him, wrapping his arms around your chubby form with strength enough to make you gasp. He closed his eyes and felt like crying, thinking that he wasn’t doing his job right as you were suffering because of him - he didn’t like feeling powerless when it came to something he wanted, and here these girls were the biggest obstacle between you and your happiness, something he needed to see you experiencing through every moment of your life. “Don’t ever say that again,” Katsuki almost hissed in your ear, and he noticed the hair on your skin standing up. “Don’t you dare speak like that again. I’d give my all for you to understand just how beautiful you are; your curves are part of you and you can bet your ass you look amazing with them. If anyone tries to tell you otherwise let me know and I’ll have… a word with them myself.”“But don’t you think you could be with someone who looked better with you as well?”“You look great next to me (y/n),” he retorted as he pulled away, his hands still on your shoulders. His eyes burned straight through you and noticed you were completely serious in your words. “And I’m happy with you. That’s all the reassurement I need to know that I want you in my life - you’re more than I deserve, that’s why I’m so amazed at the fact that you’ve been able to stick with me for so long now. I’m so fucking happy it’s unreal, and it’s all thanks to you. I couldn’t care less about what you look like because to me you’re just the most beautiful girl I’ve ever laid my eyes on.”You seemed to think for a moment, maybe trying to see if he was lying, but soon you relaxed under his touch and leaned on his arm, a sigh escaping your lips. The both of you stood like that for a moment as silence took the room over and Katsuki felt his expression soften just by having close to him, wanting nothing more than just keep you away from whatever thing or person that could harm you in any way. You were strong and he knew it, but the need to protect you and make you feel cherished was just as big as your heart.“How do you always manage to say just what I need to hear?” you said quietly.He knew you all too well, would’ve been the easier answer. He wanted only to see you happy next to him and to kick your insecurities away from your heart, relieving you of all pain. It would’ve been the easiest answer. He just loved you too much as you were, was the hard one he hadn’t had the courage to admit.“I guess I just want to try and make you feel comfortable with yourself the most I can,” he said instead, “I wouldn’t want my girl to feel down like that, especially when she’s pretty fucking hot already with her chubbiness.” You laughed for the first time in what felt like forever although it had only been half an hour, and he felt his heart jumping in his chest as he looked down at your form before bringing you close to him and lying down, your head hidden on the crook of his neck as he wrapped an arm around your waist - this time, you offered no resistance at all. “Now tell me babe,” he added, a plan starting to form in his mind and a smile on his lips. “This Saturday you have to go to school again, right?”“Yeah, I have to take the classes until the midterms if I want to pass; why?”
He didn’t reply however, and he closed his eyes before he felt you looking up at him; if you could’ve guessed what he was thinking, he was sure you’d rush to try and stop him from doing anything you could consider reckless. Don’t worry love, he told himself, I’ll make sure no one says a single fucking bad thing about you again - those damn extras will learn not to mess with the one I love.

myfandemons  asked:Okay but imagine Bakugo having a crush on reader. And they are actually really good. They always have a confident grin on their face. Bakugo gets pissed why they are always like this and openly asks them in class how they can be this happy and in a good mood. Everyone looks at them and reader tells him "I'm happy because I don't want to fall into depression again." He's silent for a bit, grabs all his confidence, grins and tells them "I knew that the person I fall in love with would be strong."      We are all gonna pray that I can write Bakugou and not sound like an idiot- let’s do this     Also I saw your other request and took the info from that and also brought it here!Bakugou💣When Bakugou had a crush on you it was a flurry of emotions. You were talented, confident, tough, always so happy. Those very things were both what made him like you and ticked off at you at the same time.💣Usually when you were always bubbly it actually made him feel…light hearted? Flustered. He’d just make a snarky comment at you to try and combat the feeling but you’d just laugh and stay positive. You drove him mad, in a wonderful kind of way.💣Then there was when you fought. You certainly didn’t hold back. You were fast, determined. He loved to fight against you. It was fun, there was a thrill to it. You would always laugh whenever he missed you with an explosion. He’d get a little riled up from how carefree you were about the whole situation, but the second he’s cleaning up and standing in the shower he’ll just zone out and think about how cute you were.💣It isn’t until everyone’s in class after multiple attacks on the class. For once there’s peace and a normal schedule. Mostly everybody is a little down in spirits. But then there was you. Still happy, cheering everyone up. Everyone walked in sad and before Aizawa even entered everyone was back to being themselves. 💣How could you be fine after everything that’s happened? He kept staring at you, brows furrowed and eyes narrowed. Then he’ll just yell it out. 💣”Why are you always so happy?” He snipped. Everyone would look at him, then at you. Iida and Uraraka would go to chime at him but before they could open their mouths you give him the softest smile that any of them had ever seen. Half of the class just stared at you in curiosity and Bakugou? His cheeks immediately heated up as his heart hammered. The class would just pin it on him being mad.💣”I’m always happy because, well…I guess I don’t wanna fall into depression again. I refuse to,” you said, slightly hesitant. There was a determination in your voice that was fierce. 💣Now the class turned their heads back to Bakugou, curious on how he would react to you. Safe to say the last thing they expected was for him to grin and slam his fist on his table, small sparks leaving them.💣”I knew the person I fell for would be so strong.”💣Fake it till you make it, since the second you grinned with a blush on your face Bakugou’s composure flew out the window along with his dignity.

            Gift Swap        Dex sucks at poetry. He has never written a poem before other than in like, 6th grade English class, and that is not an experience he wants to revisit. Dex has never been great at words, and writing code is usually the only writing he likes to do. He likes machines because they don’t try to talk to you. He understands machines and how they work and what they need. Poetry, not so much. He doesn’t get why some poems rhyme and some don’t, and why they need metaphors. Some poems just make no fucking sense to him, and why the hell do they have to be all convoluted? But he always likes the poems that Nursey writes for him. Nursey gave everything he had into his poetry, and you could tell. Dex would often roll his eyes whenever Nursey read a poem to him, but that was mainly just to annoy Nursey, because he secretly could listen to Nursey read his poetry all day. So for their anniversary, Dex decides to write Nursey a poem for a change. He sits down at his desk for a few hours, and in the end it’s clunky and made of random bits and pieces, but he thinks about the poem like a machine that he’s trying to put together.Nursey is at a loss of what to get Dex for their anniversary. He thinks about writing Dex a poem, but he writes Dex poems all the time, so he wants to do something new and different. Nursey saw writing as creating something with your hands, so he decides to try to be creative in another way: by trying to build something for Dex. Nursey knows that he’s clumsy as all hell and is no good with a toolkit, but he wants to make something for Dex anyway. He thinks Dex will appreciate it, it’ll show that he actually does pay attention when Dex talks about mechanics and building shit (even though Nursey likes to pretend that he doesn’t pay attention just to piss off Dex). He decides to make him one of those mini desks that people use in bed to do their homework, because honestly Dex gets way too stressed out while he’s doing homework and needs to chill more, so doing homework in bed might help. Nursey goes to Home Depot and definitely buys some of the wrong tools after like two hours of wandering around aimlessly, but eventually he gets what he needs. The next day, while Dex is in class, Nursey sits in the basement of the Haus and works on building the mini desk. In the end, he only injures himself twice, and the desk is a little lopsided, but he hopes Dex will like the creativity and passion he puts into it. Nursey thinks about all of the words that Dex will write on the desk, and it makes him happy. Nursey can’t believe that his boyfriend wrote him a fucking poem, can’t believe how much he loves this stupid boy and his red hair and mechanic’s hands. He can’t stop reading the poem, and after a day he’s memorized it. He pins it up over his desk so he can look at it whenever he’s writing.Dex stares at the mini desk, and almost can’t believe it. Nursey made this? The desk is made from sturdy wood and even though it was a little lopsided, it was exactly what he needed for his homework. Perfectly imperfect, just like them.

[8:50 P.M] [italics are flashbacks!, fem reader!]“papa, how did you and mama meet?”you knew that this question was bound to be brought up by your twin daughters the moment they knew how to speak.yet somehow, it caught you off guard.atsumu, who was laid at the other end of your little cuddle pile, was taken aback by the sudden curiosity of your eldest.“well, it’s simple really. she entered the ball with her beautiful dress and a lot of butterflies were following after her, akemi-chan.”atsumu proceeded to sing his own rendition of the said disney movie, while tickling the sides of your eldest. her sweet laughter bubbling from her chest as she tries to squirm away from her father.“but papa, you just told us yesterday that cinderella wasn’t real.”it was your turn to laugh at the blonde’s defeated face as your younger one, aimi, pointed an accusing finger to your husband.“how about you listen to mama? your father here has pea brains and mama remembers the story really well.”you received two sets of enthusiastic children looking up at you in expectation and an offended “hey!” from atsumu, all the while shooting the latter with a teasing and challenging gaze.“oi, if yer here for the twins, i suggest that you wait for them after practice.”“oh not to worry, akagi-san. i don’t really care about the twins much.”you pretty much made a huge impression on both of them, making a beeline for the captain who was packing up the net. “shin-nii, i want to go home now! can’t you hurry?” “i’ll be with ya in a bit, f/n. just wait outside please.” you slumped your shoulders from the short reply your favorite cousin gave you. you were ready to take your exit when you felt a hand come to your shoulder, forcing you to stay in place and try to retain your balance. “what the- hey!” “what d'ya mean by ‘i don’t really care’ huh?”“i simply don’t care. that’s it, ya piss blonde jerk! not much to it now, don’t it?” “atsumu, don’t get riled up by my cousin.”“how come ya scold me and not her?!” “"cause shin-nii loves me and i’m his favorite! must be nice to always be on his good side now, huh?” suna, clearly amused by everything going on around him, secretly took videos while you bicker back and forth with the blonde twin. osamu just took atsumu by the arm and flung him back, apologizing on his twin’s behalf.“papa you fought with mama the first time you met her?”“uncle 'samu told us that after you met, you continued bicketing with mama!”the addressed man had his pride crumbled. more by you and your kids, more so because osamu told the children a story about him behind his back.“bickering, aimi-chan. but papa always apologized by giving mama strawberry milk back then.”“that’s right! yer mama’s greatest weakness is strawberry milk! give her some of it and she’ll have a soft heart.”the two kids seemed to take this into account, seeing it as a potential bribe so they can visit their uncles whenever they want, especially their uncle shinsuke.“oh, it’s past your bedtime ya two kids! go to yer rooms now.”you urged the two reluctant children out of the room after they gave you and atsumu cheek kisses as a good night greeting.jumping into your husband’s arms, you let yourself sigh in relief as atsumu runs his hands at your hair.“telling the children of one of my weaknesses, really? as if their puppy eyes aren’t enough of a guilt trip already!”“well, yer really weak when it comes to our children. i’m surprised they’re not yet spoiled!”“i mean you do a good job at teaching them about appreciating what they have.”atsumu chuckled to himself, a subtle tone of relief underlying in it as he continued to give your back a few rubs. he kissed the crown of your head before squeezing your body, almost as if he’s releasing the stress of motherhood from it.“i have ya with me in raising them. of course i’ll do a great job.”“not the reply i expect but it’s cheesy, ya piss blonde jerk.”“hey!”this time, atsumu wasn’t as offended as he was years ago. the day he first laid his eyes on you.the day he first saw the woman he wouldn’t have thought he’d marry someday.wendy’s love letter: my inability to write bickering scenes aside, i firmly believe that atsumu would make a great dad! this was a really fun idea to write about too!

Dear future husbandSo… Thanks for the 900k!!!! Im worried as fuck if I get to 1,000 bjt whatever!He sighed in relief at seing that for once his office was organized exactly the way he preferred… after hours of inspecting for any dirt or dust.So some hours of his day would be saved instead of himself cleaning the whole room… and if the situation was serious he would use his quirk.People just like it to see him piss off…. they begged for it when they didn’t followed his orders. So it wasn’t technically his fault for overhauling one or two precepts a day for being, what he called, unworthy of workimg on the yakusa or dumb as bugs.He closed his office and made his way through the hallways before his ears spotted a melody, rather irritating one if you would ask him, accompanied with a beautiful and angelic humming of his angel.He scoffed slightly before following the sound, shoving his hands on his pants pockets.’Didn’t you just said that you wanted to clean the living room instead of him? Is not what it looks like apparently…’He opened the door to see yourself while playing and dancing along with a broom, sliding on the floor, wearing one of the socks he bought for you….his eye twitched the slightest for seing that you were dirtying them before he paid attention with the annoying melody.“I deserve a brakeAnd don’t forget the flowers every anniversary’Cause if you’ll treat me rightI’ll be the perfect wifeBuying groceriesBuy-buying what you need” You made a slightly immitation like you were writing at something and Chisaki arched one of his eyebrows.What the hell was his dumb yet adorable angel doing now?“You got that nine to fiveBut, baby, so do ISo don’t be thinking I’ll be home and baking apple piesI never learned to cookBut I can write a hookSing along with meSing-sing along with me-” You holded the broom close to you while the other hand pointed at some wall while you sayed a very cheerful ’hey’ and he himself couldn’t help to roll his eyes at seing you didn’t noticed his presence.Too emerged on your song apparently.“You gotta know how to treat me like a ladyEven when I’m acting crazyTell me everything’s alright”You placed the broom next to the wall and started to freely dancing in your own sweet way, no more objects to forbid you and the feeling that you had done it already the job made you feel more on the clouds than ever.“Dear future husbandHere’s a few things you’ll need to know if you wanna beMy one and only all my lifeDear future husbandIf you wanna get that special lovin’Tell me I’m beautiful each and every night”He scoffed quietly and closed the door behind him as he made himself comfortable laying on the wall with crossed arms, never taking his golden eyes off from you.“After every fightJust apologizeAnd maybe then I’ll let you try and rock my body rightEven if I was wrongYou know I’m never wrongWhy disagree?Why, why disagree?”You gotta know how to treat me like a ladyEven when I’m acting crazyTell me everything’s alrightDear future husbandHere’s a few thingsYou’ll need to know if you wanna beMy one and only all my life Dear future husbandMake time for meDon’t leave me lonelyAnd know we’ll never see your family more than mine"Why? Why would he ever leave the only good and pure thing on his life lonely he wondered.He sighed again and made his way quietly to you, his black sock on the floor preventing any sounds to spot his presence before he allowed it.Each time you took a step he took a step back just to admire you for a bit longer, truly smilling underneath his black mask.The song was stupid, the rhythm was ridiculous… but yet he found himself adoring the way you were enjoying yourself.’I’ll be sleeping on the left side of the bed Open doors for me and you might get some kissesDon’t have a dirty mindJust be a classy guyBuy me a ringBuy-buy me a ring, baBE-“ you yelped loudly at feeling a hand coming from behind you, slidding through your sides to your waist while the other grabbed your right hand and one gloved thumb carresed the ring on your finger."I did bought you a ring though.” The nonchalantly voice of Kai was really the last thing you wanted tk hear in the middle of your stupid dancing.“Kai you almost made my heart jump pit of my chest!” You whined while burrowing your face in your hands in embarrassment, feeling all of your face turning beef red while your body refused to move.Chisaki let go of you to turn of that music, his ears thanked him, before takinga few steps to examine it the room before he returned those big hands of his to tilt your head up woth a hand on your cheek.He smirked at seing the furious blush on your cheeks. Bastard.So he had that affect on you still huh? That’s surely interesting.“Continue.”You looked into his eyes with a very confused ‘huh?’ Before he flipped your forehead.“The song. Your voice is much more enjoyable to hear than… that thing.” He sayed with a bit of disgust the last part.You gagged before trying again to formulate words, your embarrassment of being caught still on affect.“Come on.” He touched foreheads together “Is not going to kill neither of us, besides...” he went to whisper very lowly in your ear “My fiance’s voice is the most beautiful thing… like a angel’s call, my own and precious angel.” You blushed even more at his words, his actions not really helping but you still lowered your head a bit as you tried again, only this time your voice in the air.“Dear future husbandHere’s a few thingsYou’ll need to know if you wanna beMy one and only all my lifeDear future husbandIf you wanna get that special lovingTell me I’m beautiful each and every night”He grabbed onto your arms, relieved that you had showered and bathed, and placed them to envelop around his neck as he monotonously stared you down, but hints of smile showing it to you as you gave him your own, embarrassment long forgotten at seing the serenity and calm golden eyes staring you down.You decided to be a little adventurous and stood up on your tip toes to sweetly sing the last part.“Future husband, better love me right~”His eyes widen for a brief second before he narriwed them at you, one hand from your waist coming to lower his mask down.“I wouldn’t ask your hand in marriage if I wasn’t sure about my decisions.” “I know!” You giggled “Is just a song!” “A very stupid one if I do say so myself.”“Then… why did you demanded that-”He shutted you up with the best strategy he had, the bold action both pleasing himself and you.A kiss.

anonymous asked:I'm in an angsty mood, so could I ask a drabble (or hc) of lost light crew finds and tries to help a predacon who had been experimented on so their flight or fight instinct, have been reprogrammed to only fight? (Whenever they feel threaten they will attack anything)You were a failed experiment of the Senate, a test to see if they could create the perfect soldier who felt no remorse and would fight to the death. It didn’t work but the experiments left you permanently scarred, both physically and mentally. Because you didn’t turn out as they wanted you to they abandoned you in the lab that you had been “reborn” in. It took years before the Lost Light found you, stuck in a stasis pod. When they opened it you immediately felt afraid, not knowing who they were, and did what your new instincts told you to; attack. Luckily you didn’t hurt anyone to badly and you told them what was wrong with you. They promised to help you if you followed them. Not seeing any other choice you decided to trust them and board the Lost Light.Rodimus is pissed and wants to beat up whoever did this to you. Declares that you’re part of the Rod squad now and anyone who messes with you messes with him. Won’t let anyone treat you like a criminal for what happened to you.Ultra Magnus/Minimus Ambus thinks it’s disgusting that someone would do something like this and makes sure that you are provided everything you need to recover from those awful experiments.Megatron is enraged. This is what he fought against, the Senate using people as tools to further their own agenda. But then he remembers that he wasn’t any better himself. If he had still been a warlord and leader of the Decepticons he would probably have used you in the war. It makes him sick when he realizes this.Drift is with Rodimus on this one, he will defend you as well from anyone who thinks they can give you slag for something you couldn’t help. Offers to teach you how to meditate so that you will gain more control over your emotions.Swerve is a bit scared of you but as long as you don’t do anything bad you’re alright in his book. Probably shows you some movies and tv shows that aren’t to extreme and won’t make you react in a negative way.Ten is very calming to be around and you never feel threatened around him, which is a very good thing in your case. He shows you how to do crafts which in turn proves to be a helpful and calming hobby.Skids tries to treat you like anyone else since he doesn’t want to treat you like some sort of freak. He acts as if you’re completely normal and only does differently if he notices that things are going south and you are starting to feel threatened.Riptide stays away from you since he doesn’t trust you to not suddenly go crazy and attack. If he hears from others that you’re doing better then he will start to approach you but until then he will stay out of your way.Rung have encountered similar cases to yours before, bots who have been so traumatized that they always respond with violence in stressful situations, so he knows what to do to make sure that doesn’t happen and how to calm you down if you do.Whirl wants to fight you when he first sees you since it looks like you could pack a punch. But then he learns of what the Senate did to you and that desires fades and a new one blossoms up. The desire to protect you. He knows how it is to be changed against one’s will and he will be damned if he lets anyone treat you any less for it.Fortress Maximus feels for you but at the same time he can’t help but be on guard when you are around. You are dangerous, even if you don’t mean to be. He will try to act civil around you but if you do anything he won’t hesitate to defend himself.Tailgate doesn’t judge you based on your past and acts like normal around you. He tries his best to befriend you and does everything he can to make you feel safe and at home on the Lost Light. You deserve a new chance at life.Cyclonus is wary of you but still tries to treat you like he would anybody else, if not more gentle. As long as you don’t attack anyone or pose an immediate threat to Tailgate he will accept your presence onboard the ship.Chromedome thinks you’re dangerous but that doesn’t mean that you don’t deserve a chance. During the experimentations they probably used mnemosurgery on you so he offers to help you in that regard and try to fix you.Rewind is saddened when he learns of what happened to you since it reminds him of what happened to his ex-conjunx, Dominus Ambus, when he was tamed. Therefore he treats you carefully and with a certain amount of respect.Brainstorm thinks it’s wrong. He’s done a lot in the name of science and not everything have been morally right but what happened to you was taking it too far, even by his standards. Tries to find a way to cure you of the damage done.Perceptor also thinks it’s wrong what happened to you for the same reasons as Brainstorm. But at the same time he’s on edge with you around since he knows if anything happens you can’t control yourself and he will have to subdue you.Ratchet is angry because he can’t help you as much as he wish he could. He can fix someone’s frame but the mind is different, much more delicate. He does what he can to keep you calm and help you transition into your new life.First Aid thinks you’re scary since you can’t control your actions when you feel threatened but he still wants to try and help you. Gives you medicine to calm down if you start to feel threatened and keeps an optic on you at all times.

anonymous asked:Hi hi ya !! I just like literally found your blog and I'm in love it's so so good keep the hard work up and can u do like a headcanon of candy catching the boys masturbating if you have time ✨✨✨ please and thank you 👍👍Nathaniel doesn’t even like masturbating for this exact
reason, fear of getting caught. He only does it when he just can’t take it anymore.
So for him to get caught, you’d have to really catch him by surprise because he
doesn’t like taking risks. He’d probably gasp really loud and try to cover
himself with something. His entire body would be red, he would be stuttering,
not knowing what to say. “O-OHMYGOSH Y-Y/N I UM UM UMMM.” You’d immediately
close the door and he would cover his face with his hands. He wouldn’t come out
of his room until hours later, even if he has to pee. He can’t look you in the
eye for weeks after that. He doesn’t even know how to start a conversation with
you anymore.Castiel would shoot out a bunch of obscenities. Probably
every curse word in the book. “SON OF A B****!!! F***! S***!” He doesn’t know
how to react so he just freaks out and tries to throw the blanket over himself.
“GET OUT!!” He’d literally just continue to curse at himself and would probably
scream into his pillow. Instant boner-killer tbh. He doesn’t speak to you for
an entire week and avoids you at all costs. He probably doesn’t even show up at
school for like two days cause he just can’t bring himself to face you and he’s
freaking out. When you finally do talk to him, he’s just a blushing mess and
will get pissed if you make any kind of joke about it.Lysander is completely frozen, he doesn’t even know what to
say or do. He just stands there with his wanker in hand, staring at you like a
deer in headlights. “Y-Y/N?” When you leave his face isn’t even red it’s like…
Purple or something idek. He’s so embarrassed. He has no clue how to handle the
situation. I feel like he’s stealthy enough to never get caught, not even by
his brother, so you seeing him completely catches him off guard. He decides to
take the mature approach to the situation and just directly address it. “I’m
really sorry that you h-had to um… See that.” If you’re cool with it he just
kind of breathes this huge sigh of relief, but he still has no idea how to act
around you. Talk about invasion of privacy….Armin honestly doesn’t give a shit. He might jump a little
bit and freak out. “WHAT THE HECK?!” After you leave though he just keeps going
tbh. Not gonna let your lack of manners stop him from getting it on, ya know?
He’s been caught plenty of times by his mother and Alexy, so he’s used to it.
He is a little embarrassed by it but he’s not gonna let it get to him. When he
sees you he just laughs it off and turns it into such a big joke that you
eventually forget how uncomfortable the situation was in the first place. It’s
now a common joke between you two.Kentin freezes up and just stands there. He doesn’t say
anything, he doesn’t move, just stands there. It’s not until after you leave
that he has a reaction. He screams. “HOLY F***ING S***.” He’s pacing around his
rom back and forth, is punching his pillow, pulling at his hair, everything.
When you see him next he’s doing everything he can to not walk past you, talk
to you, make eye contact with you or anything. If you ever want to talk to this
boy again you’re going to have to approach him first cause there is no way in
hell he’s going to do it. He’s embarrassed as hell for like a month and acts so
weird around you now. It’s best if you just act like it never happened, for his
sake.

anonymous asked:hello. i'm trying to write a fic centred on chuuya but i don't really understand his character   first, i don't know how intelligent chuuya is. he always fell for dazai's tricks, even if he knew dazai for a long time and should have known that everything about dazai is a trap. and there's his defeat at the hands of ranpo and poes book. he is supposed to be a temporary leader, yet he got caught in a book.  second, i don't know how he'd ever lose in a normal fight. aside from lovecraft and a book.Firstly, thank you for sending this to me!! I’m SUPER flattered you trust my interpretation of Chuuya enough to bring these doubts here! They’re very good ones too, I’ve been excited to talk about them. Let’s see if I can help ya find a better understanding.About Chuuya’s intelligence, I would call it average. He’s not particularly brilliant, but he’s also not particularly dumb. He’s been shown to be able to hold a negotiation, to know when to pause and contemplate conditions and to question the meaning behind others’ actions. There are things he’s mindful of. But, as you say, he’s also been shown to make mistakes, to fail to plan ahead and get led on. Back in Fifteen too, he figured some things out on his own, but he also got massively messed with. If we wanna go further, we can also note that he seems cultured in limited aspects (cash cash and quality things to buy) but still really thug-ish and lacking in others. All in all, an average man with his good thinking points but also his blind spots. However, comparing him to incredibly clever opponents like Dazai and Ranpo, one a manipulative strategy expert and the other an outright genius, he’s bound to look a lot worse off. Regular intelligence just doesn’t hold up to their level, that’s a problem nearly every character would have.The thing is, tho… the issues you describe, the mistakes he makes, are all part of an overarching problem of his, which is personality overriding intelligence.Chuuya is very passionate, hot-blooded as they come, there’s no doubt about that; he’s as loud about his enjoyment as he is about his anger. When he fights, he allows himself to have a good time with it and grins openly. When he means to express something, he does so often intensely. When he’s pissed off, he doesn’t hold back from saying it or letting it out with violent gestures. Anyone who is perceptive notices this from just one or two looks at him, and if that person is someone strategic, they know this personality trait makes Chuuya a good target for provoking and manipulating. Temper is a big flaw of his. He may not be exactly dumb, but push his buttons right and he’ll be tricked, or too pissed to think straight, which can be his downfall. Case in point: Ranpo provoking him into throwing the first attack physically. He also doesn’t care one bit for the tangle of double intentions and manipulative strategies, since he’s a very straight-forward, no-bullshit person himself, and that makes him impatient dealing with it. All this is why he’s most effective when combined with someone more astute to guide him (after all, soukoku is Chuuya’s incredible raw power and capacity to fight with total abandon, plus Dazai’s cunning smarts and support ability).That is to say, the level of intelligence to write him having will also depend on whether he’s calm or riled up at the moment, and if he’s been advised or is being supported by someone else. It’s also worth noting that Chuuya is AWARE of his shortcomings, which is a very good thing, because it allows him to look out and compensate for them how he can. He’s perfectly capable of recognizing who’s smarter, he’s okay with that and knows it’s best to let them call the shots, he doesn’t modify plans on the go or makes big decisions himself when he’s working under a better strategist, much like his role in the mafia under Mori. He has very good instincts, he will know when things are going right or when they’ve been messed up. But why he falls for Dazai’s shit in particular is another matter. He does know Dazai is a sneaky bastard, he’s been shown to call Dazai out on bullshit and to realize when foul play is up, sometimes early, sometimes late. It’s more of a thing of instinct and knowing Dazai too well than a thing of being up to speed on all his strategies, but still, he notices. He knows. Which makes his falling into Dazai’s expectations not a matter of pure intelligence, ‘cause it’s not that things just go over his head. He could break away from the pattern when he notices it, he could look at what Dazai expects him to do and be like “well fuck this”. But he doesn’t. Partly, because he’s thoughtful enough to see when he’s cornered and the good courses of action to follow are just 1, but mostly, because he trusts Dazai. Chuuya believes that Dazai’s thinking is right, and that his intentions are to get things done the best possible way. He trusts that Dazai won’t have him killed by his own ability or sacrifice him to whichever enemy they’re facing, so he choses, willingly, to go along. Sometimes even without Dazai saying anything, like in Dead Apple. He wouldn’t be manipulated in this particular way by someone else, I believe, because it’s Dazai he has that complicated relationship with, it’s something personal. Were it someone else, he’s a lot more careful.I think that’s about that! I hope it clarifies his type of smarts (and the personality traits affecting them) a lil bit. Now then, about his capacity to be the next Port Mafia boss and how this all affects the position… I agree that he has a long way to go to get on Mori’s level. In his favor, he already has a lot of great traits for the job: he is devoted to the Mafia with his whole self, he’s intensely loyal, caring about his subordinates but absolutely ruthless to the enemy, he’s a force to be terrified of yet he’s respectful and responsible, he has a true mafioso’s etiquette where it’s needed and will listen and negotiate. And his character and reputation could make for a presence even more imposing than Mori’s, pretty good for dealing with other criminals. But he has those flaws of losing his temper, and lacking the tools to face manipulators when they try to go after him. A mafia boss who is so easily provoked won’t do. A mafia boss who’s not strategic has a lot of trouble on his plate. Chuuya certainly has a lot to work on. However, he’s been growing and maturing since the time of the Sheep; meeting Mori and seeing him operate as leader already helped him understand many things, many wrongs of his in regards to his organization. So I’m inclined to think he’s been learning even more working under Mori all these years. Even that need for cruelty you named, in their conversation about what it means to be a leader, Mori did name that sometimes you even have to cut people off of your organization to keep it striving and Chuuya understood. He began to see the hardest parts of leading. A good proof of his progress is the way the rest of Port Mafia saw him as a suitable interim leader. When Mori was down ill, we see Chuuya leading the group without a hitch; there could’ve been power struggles, or disorganization, or a lack of collaboration from certain factions of the group due to not being ordered by Mori. But what we were shown was none of that. Chuuya was the naturally appointed leader, without any tensions with the other powerful executive around (Kouyou) or the longer-lasting mafia member (Hirotsu). The organization was able to take effective action under his lead. Whether he is ready for the job yet or not, he has Port Mafia’s support, which is probably the most important part.I maintain that one of Chuuya’s best qualities as the capo of PM would precisely be leaning on the right companions. If among his executives were at least one trusted advisor with Mori’s or Dazai’s type of intelligence, he’d be much better off. And given that he is both able to recognize his shortcomings, okay with turning to other people to do what he’s not the best at, and has learned that the organization won’t get anywhere if he shoulders it all alone (from experience with the Sheep), I’d say he has what he needs to figure out a good style of command. He doesn’t have Mori’s incredible capacity and there are things I don’t think he’ll ever have, but he doesn’t have to have it all himself. And I’m sure as much as he has the personal flaws of falling into tricks and manipulation and acting rashly, being responsible as he is, caring as he is for his underlings, if he is in a position of leadership he would be forced to control his temper and not risk THEM, or himself if they truly depend on him. It would be difficult, but he’s known to have a bit of a “mother hen” attitude towards the others and care a lot about the lives of PM member, so I think this is something he’d pick up doing: thinking of who and what he’s risking, stopping himself and trying to find the better way.I’ve talked a bit more about mafiaboss!Chuuya in this post, you might’ve seen it already, but in case you haven’t there’s some more material!For now, I hope this was helpful and that your fanfic turns out amazing!! I tried to get to this one quick so you can continue your writing. Again, thanks for your kind words and for bringin the Chuuya talk in here![PD: I’ve thought about writing a sort of “guide”, basically putting my personal notes from how I roleplay Chuuya (I don’t write fanfic cos I spend too much time and writing energy in RP fdhdfgfh) in some sort of short format to share in case it might help any other writers keep track of characterization, but it feels kind of… I dunno how to say it, egocentric??? Condescending?? I’m probably not the best at Chuuya either. But, if you think that might help you more, let me know.]

That SeasonTitle: That Season (Gadreel x Reader)Summary: The reader stumbles upon Gadreel during nesting season and he has to awkwardly explain how that correlates to her missing clothes. Hmmm where can this lead too? A/N: Last fic of the year!!!! Possible smutty and adorable bonding in 2nd chapter someday? Word Count: 1,815“What the hell?” Digging through your closet, you could tell something was off. Now, you didn’t have that many articles of clothing, but you had a hell of a lot more than was in here. You couldn’t find your favorite hoodie, the one you always wore on lazy days. Someone was stealing you clothes, and it was starting to piss you off. “Where is it?”“Where’s what?” you looked up to see Sam in the doorway, eyebrows raised in interest. He must have been walking by your room as he heard your struggles. “Have you been stealing my clothes?” Peaking further into your room, the younger Winchester let out an amused snort. “Well, it wasn’t me. But I think I know where you should start your search.” He cast a glance over his shoulder and down the hallway. “Your… ahem, boyfriend has has been acting pretty strange.” Your face lit pleasantly pink, reminded of the angel staying just down the hall from you that cared for you so much. After he had been resurrected a few months after everything that had happened, you begged Dean to let him stay in the bunker. As reluctant as he was, he knew how happy you would be, so he said yes. Not long after that you had slowly started dating the devoted angel, going one step at a time.“What, you think Gadreel is stealing my stuff?” Although you could never see Gad stealing anything from you, let alone your clothes, it seemed more likely it was him than Sam or Dean. “I’m just saying. He’s been acting pretty strange recently, hasn’t he? I haven’t seen the two of you together all week.” “Yeah, that’s true.” Gadreel had been locked in his room for the past few days, and his appearances outside his room have been scarce. It was actually starting to worry you. “Yeah, thanks. I’m going to check on him.” Sam nodded and sent you a “good-luck” look before leaving you to think over your options. You really should go check on him, but maybe this was just some weird angel stuff. Then again, Cas never really acted like this, so maybe something’s wrong. Anyway, he was worrying you. You started the trek down the hall towards his room, before something unusual caught your eye. The doors to all the guest rooms between your room and Gad’s were opened wide, whereas they’re normally closed. You slowly pushed the door open and saw the beds were stripped of their blankets and pillows. Odd. Coming up to Gadreel’s room, you knocked, a bit worried for the state of you odd angel lover.“Stay out!” You flinched back a bit at the sternness of his voice and drew your hand back as if burned. “Gad?” you heard shuffling inside the room and were about to turn away, before the door cracked open, revealing the angel. His hair was tousled up and his cheeks were flushed. As soon as he saw you in front of him he scrunched his body up to make himself appear smaller before you, bowing his head and closing his eyes in a humbling greeting. His hands were held out in front of him as if surrendering, and it almost looked like he was about to kneel in your presence. He was always like that, making you feel as if you were so much more important than him- as if you were a regal queen and he were simply a lowly servant. Although, it was much the opposite- with him a literal celestial beam of pure light and energy contained inside a human body and you a simple human.“(Y/N). Forgive me. I did not realize it was you.” You fought the flustered look on your face at his noble gesture. “It’s fine.” He lifted his face, eyes focusing in closely on you. “I was just wondering if you’ve been… maybe taking my clothes for some reason?” it was an awkward question to ask, but Gad hesitated, so you figured he had something to do with it. You leaned over and tried to speak into his room to see for yourself, but the angel promptly moved to the same side you were, blocking your view.“No!” You jumped back, shocked at his sudden outburst. He seemed to notice that he scared you, and once again his features softened.“You’re acting really strange, Gad. What’s wrong?” He hesitated for another moment before sighing. “I was under the impression Castiel would explain it to you.”“Explain what?” the intensity in his eyes worried you. “Gadreel… please. You’re really worrying me. We’re a couple, that means you can tell me anything, right?” He nodded, but the uncomfortable look never left his face. “If you wish, dear one.” He turned and closed the door, and you knew he still didn’t want you to see whatever was in his room. “(Y/N), there’s something that happens to an angel after courting it’s intended. It is quite an important part, and it take a long time to pass.” You shifted on your feet, nervous as to what he meant by “intended”. In all honesty, even with an angel boyfriend, you knew little about angelic lore and the things that happen. It took a bit to process the information.“So… this is some sort of hormonal angel time for you? Like a period?” “It is not menstruation, no. But it does prepare an angel for… courting and mating routines.” Thank God you didn’t have a drink, because you would have absolutely choked when he said that. Noticing your discomfort, he broke the silence. “Mating is not required. This process will just repeat next year if nothing-”“Wait, but angels can’t reproduce, can they?”“No. The process of mating is to bond two angels together for eternity.” He cast a small glance at you and softened his features. “Or an angel and a human.” You smiled, knowing how much you meant to him, and he meant to you.“So, after… ‘courting’ me, as you say, you get the urge… to mate? Is that what this is?” He offered only a small nod in response. You took a breath, trying to piece together all the facts. “So… what does any of this have to do with my clothes being stolen?” Once again, he shifted uncomfortably in his spot.“During these times, an angel’s wings get very… sensitive and sore. It is a rather unpleasant feeling. Due to that and wanting to impress the intended, we have the urge to partake in… nesting.” Before you could ask what he meant, he opened the door and let you in with a bit of uncertainty in his motions. To say what you saw wasn’t a surprise would be a lie. On the bed was a huge, circular pile of pillows, blankets, towels and- was that a rug you saw?- topped all with your own clothes. The room was dimly lit, with only a single lamp in the corner of the room casting a soft glow over the… nest? “This is… supposed to impress me?” Realizing how harsh your words sounded, you turned towards him, scared you’d offended his competitive angel side. He was looking very let down and almost regretful, and you waved your hands in a frantic hurry to make things right. “That’s not what I meant! It’s very nice. All I mean is… well, I’m a human. I don’t understand these angel things.”“Of course, I understand.” He closed the door behind him, making sure none of the boys could wander past and overhear. “It is a traditional stage in angelic courting. The larger the nest, the more likely the intended is to accepting the proposal of mating.” He must have noticed the flustered look on you face, and continued. “Do not feel obliged to accept, dear one. You may still reject me.” You almost felt your heart break as you watched the saddened look on his face. You looked up at him and held his hand. It was shaky and clammy, something out of the ordinary for him. This must be very intimate for angels to do. Nothing to take lightly.“It’s looks really comfortable. Have you been laying in it?”“Not yet. I was saving it.” “For me?” He nodded, and once again, you cheeks flushed modestly. You laughed, brushing off your nerves. “It is made out of my stuff after all.” A shadow of worry cast over Gadreels face.“I apologize for using your clothing. I simply wanted it to smell like you, so I’d feel more comforted in it.”“That’s… oddly endearing.” You smiled up at the angel you loved. “So, what exactly would happen if I accepted it? This seems pretty serious.”““It is. It is the most intimate thing an angel can do with their intended. We would likely… make love and, during the process, mating can take place- a bonding of my grace with your soul, and my name being inscribed in you. It will hurt immensely, but I will try me best to comfort your body.” He paused and looked you over as if examining you. “You are worried.” He did it again, bending himself over so he was nearer to you, holding your gaze intimately. “I promise you, you mustn’t be worried. You have a choice.” “I want to be your mate, Gadreel. I really do.” the angel watched you, green eyes still laced with uncertainty, though a small spark of hope sizzled behind them.“Are you sure? That is not all. The bonding, my grace and your soul combining, it will have effects on both you and I. After having some of my grace inside your soul, you will no longer age. You understand it is irreversible?” That was pretty major, sure, but if it meant you could be with him forever, you couldn’t say no. You took both of this hands in your, marveling at the size compared to your own.“Gad, I’ve never beenso sure about something in my life. After everything we’ve been through, I can’t imagine anything better. Those few months I’ve spent without you were the worst in my life, and I want to be with you no matter what.” Gadreel smiled and brought a hand up to your cheek, caressing the soft skin.“Does this mean yes?” you nodded and leaned up to plant a passionate kiss on his mouth. He returned it gratefully, keeping it just as simple and loving as he always had. He poured all of his emotions into the kiss, deepening it by tangling his fingers into the hair at the back of your neck, pulling you into him gently. You broke apart with a breath. “Forgive me, my light. Angels get very… needy and energized during this time.”“Good.” You pulled him down for another kiss, anticipation building for what was to come. “I can’t wait.”++Taglist!@theredheadedwinchester, @solis200213, @music-lockscreen, @bella-ca

anonymous asked:This is my first time requesting and your writing is so 👌🏽💦 but anyways, can I get any hcs for your fave characters (I'm not picky at all, so have fun with it) with a bilingual s/o (por favor y gracias!!!💖) Thank you love! I feel like I never write for
Atsushi, Kunikida, or Yosano much so I choose them ^^[Kunikida]
• The first time you mixed in your second language with Japanese when
you couldn’t remember a word he was confused as all hell. How had this subject
not come up yet? Kunikida spends the rest of the day trying to recall any other
time you’ve said something in another language and he’s thoroughly upset with
himself that he didn’t realize this sooner. He ends up writing down a list of
words—or as close as he can get—with question marks at the end because he has
no idea what it means. 
•
Kunikida has a million questions about the language and it’s differences from
Japanese. He feels like he should learn it too so you both can have private
conversations without actually having to leave the room, and thought he won’t
admit it, it makes your relationship feel extra special because it’s something
you two share with yourselves. 
•
He goes out of his way to buy a separate notebook just for little phrases and
words he knows you use a lot when you think nobody is paying attention. Instead
of asking you he looks up everything and keeps it a secret to himself, and
slowly it becomes one of his favorite quirks about you. Even if it’s not your
native language Kunikida loves hearing the way it sounds so natural coming from
your lips.
[Atsushi]
•
One of the things Atsushi admires about you is your intelligence, and the fact
that you can speak more than one language impresses him even more. Atsushi
never had much of a formal education and as much as he loves you have such a
useful skill he does feel a bit down on himself for not being able to match
that. He timidly asks you to give him lessons after a few weeks, and focuses
pretty hard on learning the language.
•
When you’re cooking dinner he asks the names for whatever ingredients you’re
using and basic house stuff like the word for toothbrush and or cup. When he
has downtime Atsushi goes over the little words he’s memorized and tries
forming sentences in his head to use later. He stutters his way through it at
first but if you encourage him he gets more comfortable as time progresses.
•
Without telling you he looks up some romantic phrases in the language and
spends almost an entire day and night memorizing them and perfecting the
sounds. The next time you’re both on a date he shakily whispers these lines in
your ear, blush creeping over his face as he prays to god he doesn’t screw it
up. 
[Yosano]
•
Listening to you complain about people pissing you off in the line at the bank
or a restaurant instantly puts her in a good mood. On top of it being a turn on
she thinks it’s hilarious to see you rip someone a new asshole in a language
they can’t even understand. She knows when you’re cursing but whomever you’re
speaking about just looks on with a smile, having no idea you’re roasting them.
If she’s having a bad day she recalls certain times this happened and it makes
her laugh like no other.
•
 Yosano loves watching movies with you in
your second language (she doesn’t mind
subtitles) for a date night. She uses it as an excuse to poke your side,
whispering in your ear and asking what‘s going on. If you ignore her she ends
up nibbling on your ear asking for a translation. 
•
Sometimes Yosano asks you to talk dirty to her in your second language even
though she has no idea what you’re saying. The purr of your voice and body
language translate enough for her to get the picture.

anonymous asked:Scenario where Bakugou's s/o broke her glasses so she cant see anything. Maybe she clings to his sleeve? Is he willing to guide her? I just . . . love fluff. I'm sorry They were in her room at the dorms with the intention to study but somehow their studying turned into a heated make out session. He was biting violently her neck twisting and turning it to his liking. As usual he wasn’t careful with her glasses so they slid down her nose after his fierce assault. He couldn’t care less about it but since they were in the way she reached to adjust them. Then unexpectedly Bakugou pushed her on the bed and before her reflexes kicked in the glasses fell on the floor.“Katsuki where are my glasses?““There’s no need for you to see. I can make you feel good even without those stupid glasses.“ He pressed his body against hers and tried to kiss her but she protested.“Katsuki I’m serious.“ She couldn’t see a thing without the glasses but if she could she would’ve seen one very pissed Bakugou. Everything in front of her was blurry but she looked around instinctively even though it was of no use. “Katsuki?“ There was no respond and she started to panic. Could he leave in a moment like this one? He couldn’t be so heartless. “Don’t tell he just left.““I’m here.““Then give me my glasses.“ This time as well he was slow to respond.“They are broken.““What?“ For his surprise her voice barely sounded angry, more like worried and scared. A shred of guilt appeared across Bakugou’s face and he was actually happy that she couldn’t see it. She extended her arms and slowly moved them from left to right and from right to left while making small and unsure steps towards the wardrobe.“Where are going?““I have to change my clothes and get the glasses fixed as soon as possible.“ She almost crossed the room to reach the wardrobe but she forgot about the nightstand next to it and almost fell when her feet came across this obstacle.“Take a few steps back and go to the right you idiot.““Well thank you very much for guiding me and don’t shout because it’s your fault to begin with.“ She was finally standing in front of the wardrobe but when she opened it she couldn’t distinguish her clothes. At least she knew her lingerie was placed in the two bottom drawers so she quickly pulled out a bra.“So that’s what you’ve been hiding from me. I’d like to see you wearing it.“ Without realizing it she took out the one with black lace she bought last week in order to surprise him later but now her plan was ruined. She put back immediately.“Just shut up and help me find my jeans.“ With a little bit of arguing and help from Bakugou she was ready but as she was about to go out she stumbled in the chair next to her desk. She felt how her body lost balance and not seeing wasn’t helping her to restore it. She was falling and it was already too late to get back on her feet so she closed her eyes expecting to meet the floor soon  enough but a firm grip on her waist stopped her from kissing the ground. Right after she was able to stand on her own two feet he bent and lifted her up letting her stomach rest on his shoulder while wrapping an arm around her to keep her from falling.“Hey what are you doing? Put me down!““You’ll kill yourself if I do it.““I can walk on my own!““Yeah right.“ She wanted to say more but she just sighted. Actually it wasn’t so bad to see this somewhat gentle side of him show up when she needed it and be saved by her knight in shining armor even if she was in this kind of situation because of him.

anonymous asked:Hey I'm not sure you got my previous ask since tumblr has a tendency to eat them... but would you write keith having to get braces and being really pissed about it and how shiro deals with him for your single dad shiro AU? Thank you! Hi there! I don’t know if this went the way that you wanted, because I also included Hunk, Pidge and Lance because they are Keith’s BFFs forever. I’m sorry this was a bit late, and tumblr did eat your first ask!! Ugh. But I do hope you still enjoy this, because it was super fun to write. BTW, what Shiro did after Keith got braces happened to me with my lunch when I had to first have braces…Thanks so much for the ask!x.V.x               “Keith,
what do you want for lunch?”               “…”               “Keith?
Oh come on now, you can’t ignore me forever.”               “…”               “Seriously,
the silent treatment?”                “..”               “Keith.”               Shiro
sighed heavily and eventually turned around so that he could take a look at his
son, who would no doubt be pouting. Sure enough, Keith was pouting with his
arms folded over his chest and bottom lip jutting out. It was quite adorable
really, on the twelve-year-old. Though, the situation was very serious and
Shiro knew better than to laugh at Keith. Keith was fragile in moments like
this and laughter would only make matters worse.               Still,
Keith was adorable.               “Come on
now Keith, they aren’t even that bad.” Shiro tried to comfort Keith who could
only glare at Shiro. He pressed his lips together in attempts to close his
mouth even more than possible. Shiro sighed.               “You
look good in them; better than the kids in all those teeny-bobby movies.” Shiro
tried again as he continued to absently pack Keith’s lunch. Keith’s glare
sharped and Shiro could almost feel the tension slice through him. He was
slightly impressed by Keith’s looks – apparently, he was improving every day.
He still needed some work in making them look more intimidating, but he was
surely improving.               “Come on
Keith. Braces aren’t that bad.” Shiro said and Keith scowled in his seat.               “Then
why don’t you get them?” Keith finally grumbled and Shiro almost cheered in
victory. Point one for Dad Shiro. He saw a sliver of the red braces on Keith’s
teeth, before the pre-teen tried to hide them again.               “That’s
because your grandmother had perfect teeth and so did I.” Shiro said and
flashed Keith his million dollar smile that made all the boys and girls swoon.
Keith sank lower in his seat, pouting again and mumbled to himself.               “Grandpa
cursed me.”               “Unfortunately.”
Shiro nodded in agreement while Keith actually tried to hiss at him. Ignoring
the gesture, Shiro packed Keith’s lunchbox into his backpack before handing it
to the young boy. “Alright, it’s time for school. Up you go. I already let you
go home early yesterday so you’re not missing another day.”               “Dad no.
There’s no way I can go to school like this.” For a brief second, Shiro watched
as a flash of hesitation and panic flew across Keith’s face before being
replaced with anger. However, he stood up and followed Shiro out the door, all
while continuing to argue. “Lance is going to make fun of me and Hunk is gonna
laugh and Pidge too!”               “They
will not. Friends don’t laugh.” Shiro murmured quietly while locking the front
door. “Your friends will be very supportive, trust me. Lots of kids get braces
these days anyway, so it’s not like you’re going to stand out.” Shiro pointed
out, causing Keith to sigh dramatically.x.V.x               Kids did
in fact notice Keith’s braces.               Pretty
much every kid in the school.               After
all, it wasn’t every day that the “weird” kid who talked to himself sometimes
and chewed on everything, came to school in braces.
Bright red braces. Plus, Lance totally made fun of him, the second he caught of
glimpse of those shiny red braces on little Keith’s teeth. Which of course,
made Hunk laugh at Lance’s stupid jokes and Pidge laughed because why wouldn’t
they? Hunk tried to apologize when Keith walked away but he couldn’t stop
giggling.               Unfortunately,
thanks to Lance’s big mouth, everyone
had heard about Keith’s braces. Which meant more amo for picking on Keith.
Keith was no stranger to bullying at school. He knew a lot of other kids didn’t
understand why he did the things he did or was the way he was. Keith always felt
blessed that despite growing up, Lance, Hunk and Pidge never once treated him
any different despite being autistic. Normally, Keith didn’t care but it was
hard to ignore when kids were laughing at him behind his back and tapping
pictures of buck-tooth horses to his locker.               Keith
sighed when another kid asked if Keith’s mouth was bleeding – oh wait, those
are just your bright red nerd braces.
He sat hunched in the back of the cafeteria, hoping that he could simply ignore
everyone and that he could eat his lunch in peace.               Lance, Hunk
and Pidge hadn’t been able to spot Keith from where he was hiding in the
cafeteria. Slowly, Keith unzipped his lunchbox and hoped for a good time. That
is until he opened up his lunchbox all the way.               Was this a joke? Was dad trying
to make a joke?               Keith
stared in dismay at his packed lunch, staring at a hard apple, a bag of crunchy chips, some pretzels and a sandwich on
toasted bread. The pain in Keith’s mouth from his braces intensified while his
stomach grumbled pathetically. Can I even
try to eat this? Keith stared mournfully at his lunch before opening his
water. At least I won’t be thirsty.               He
winced at he tried to bit into the sandwich before spitting it out when a sore
spot on his teeth became too much. The same result happened when he tried to
eat a few meager chips and pretzels. Keith didn’t even bother with the apple
before throwing away his lunch. He ignored the laughter that followed after him
before scurrying out of the cafeteria, willing back the tears in his eyes.x.V.x               “Was
that a joke today?!” Shiro blinked in
surprise when Keith shouted at him before he had closed the door to the car.
When he looked over, Shiro could see that Keith was actually furious and not being dramatic. Shiro
could barely speak before Keith had tapped both sides of his heads and nearly
screamed in frustration. “It’s bad enough that I have to wear these stupid things for a year, but you couldn’t
even think about how much it hurts when you packed my lunch?! Are you freakin’
kidding me?!” Keith tapped his head again and Shiro put the car in drive,
catching on to Keith’s signal.               “I mean,
did you seriously have to pack an apple?!
 And pretzels? You know how much my
mouth hurts!” Keith fumed and Shiro felt his eyes widened. A sickly feeling of
guilt clawed at his stomach and his grip on the steering wheel tightened.               “Oh, my
god, Keith I forgot. I’m so sorry.” Shiro groaned and almost banged his
forehead onto his steering wheel. He couldn’t believe that he had actually
forgotten to think about how much Keith’s mouth hurt – would hurt for the next
few days, when he had packed Keith’s lunch this morning. He’d just packed what
he would have normally packed, without thinking, and Shiro felt awful.               “I know!
I can’t forget these.” Keith hissed, pointing to the braces along his teeth. “I have to wear them every day. I can’t just forget about
them like that!” Keith crossed his arms over his chest furiously and glared out
the window. Shiro swallowed heavily and sighed, feeling far guiltier that he
probably should have. But it was hard for Keith to adjust to sudden and noticeable
changes such as having to get braces, and Shiro hadn’t made it any easier for
him.               “You’re
right. You can’t just forget about them or pretend they don’t exist.” Shiro
sighed when the car came to a stop at a red light. “Keith, I’m so sorry. It’s
no excuse, but I’m so sorry that I packed you a lunch that you couldn’t even
eat. It was rude of me to not consider how much pain you must be in.”               Keith
felt his stomach churn with guilt at his dad’s apology. He’d been so angry
after the atrocious day he’d had a work. At first, Keith wanted nothing more
than for his father to apologize for his actions to make Keith feel better, but
Keith realized that his dad hadn’t really done anything wrong. Sure, he’d
forgotten to pack a soft lunch, but his dad didn’t make him get braces out of
spite and to humiliate Keith. Keith’s dad never did anything to hurt Keith,
ever.               “It’s
okay. School just sucks.” Keith finally sighed, rubbing his hands along his
pants. Shiro glanced over at Keith for a second before returning to the road. “Kids
think my braces are a joke. I’m just in a stupid mood.”               “Are
kids making fun of you?” Shiro demanded, and his tone was entirely protective
and serious now. Keith snickered at the image of his dad marching to the
school. “Do I need to go to your school?” Suddenly, Keith felt guilty. His dad
had fought many of the schools in Keith’s past for their treatment of Keith’s
diagnosis and each time was a hardship on his dad and him. Keith didn’t want his
dad to be under any more stress than necessary.               “Um,
some kids are just making jokes. Like Lance. You know me, I get real hotheaded
and annoyed.” Keith rubbed at his jeans nervously and bit his lip. Since he was
watching the road, Shiro didn’t notice Keith’s posture and nodded before
relaxing.               “Well,
hopefully they’ll stop after today. Jokes get boring after a while.” Shiro
smiled and Keith forced himself to smile despite the sick feeling in his
stomach.               “Yeah.
Knowing Lance, he’ll probably be joking about some made-up girl he saved this
week.”x.V.x               I’m sorry about the other day. I’m hoping
some extra pudding will make up for it 😊.
Dad                       Keith
couldn’t fight the smile even if he wanted to when he opened up his lunch the
next day. Instead of the awful lunch yesterday, today’s lunch had two cups of
Keith’s favorite Jell-o, two cups of
chocolate pudding. Some watermelon and a cup of his dad’s homemade soup. Lance
caught sight of the grin on Keith’s face and peeked over into his lunch box
before his jaw dropped.               “That’s
adorable, but your dad packed a seriously awesome lunch!” Lance exclaimed and
Pidge and Hunk both looked in to investigate.                “Whoa.
Can I trade you a pudding cup?” Hunk asked and Pidge nodded eagerly before
scavenging their own lunch to look for something to trade.               “Nuh-uh.”
Keith stuck his tongue out, red braces poking out. “This is my lunch because my
mouth hurts.”               “Dude,
maybe I need to get someone to punch me in the mouth so my mama can pack me a
goodie pack.” Lance grumbled bitterly and bit into what was supposed to be
pizza, but really it could be anything. After all, the cafeteria served sketchy
stuff sometimes. Hunk and Pidge grumbled playfully but backed off, allowing
Keith to eat his lunch in peace.               However,
just as Keith was about to dive into his second pudding cup, his jaw exploded
with pain when he felt something hard and rubber
slam into his face. Instantly, Keith dropped his food and grabbed his jaw. His
nerves were tingling with pain, since his mouth was still sore from the braces.
Keith felt tears due to pain begin to burn in his eyes, just as several kids
started laughing. Keith barely noticed when Hunk, Pidge and Lance shot out of
their seats.               “Hey!
Why did you just do that?!” Pidge snarled, hands clenched at their sides in
fists as the three of them stared down the group of guys who had shot a rubber
band at their friend.               “Wanted
to see how much it would hurt.” One kid laughed causing his whole table to join
him.               “Well,
let’s see how much this will hurt!” Lance threatened darkly and rolled up his
sleeves. However, Hunk snatched his fist at the last second and pulled it back,
while simultaneously checking to see if Keith was okay. “I’ll knock two cents
into your stupid, tiny brain, you assholes.”               “Lance!”
Hunk whispered hotly and Pidge beamed.               “Whatever.
Don’t know why you defend that loser.” The other kid snorted and his goonies
laughed again.               “Hey!
That’s our friend you’re talking about!” Pidge hissed. “Our best friend, whose face is much more
appealing than yours will ever be without
braces.” The kid frowned at Pidge and his goonies all “ooooohed.”               “Lemme
at him, Hunk.” Lance growled darkly but Hunk easily held him back as he looked
at Keith’s cheek.               “Are you
okay?” Hunk asked when Keith wiped his eyes before anyone could see. Just as
Keith was about to speak, he flinched back when another rubber band hit his mouth. Hunk recoiled sharply and let go
of Lance, who stormed towards the table of laughing kids with Pidge hot on his
tail. A dark look settled over Hunk and he turned his full attention to the
laughing kids. There was a look in his eyes, almost like that of a soldier, who
was on his way to war and it made the lunch room’s atmosphere feel like ice.               “You
jerk.” Hunk said calmly before making his way towards the kid who had shot the
rubber bands at Keith. By now, the entire lunch room was deadly silent. Hunk
had never intervened before.               Lance
and Pidge each held back a kid as Hunk made his way towards his target. By now,
the kid was beginning to sweat and he scrambled to try and get out of his seat.
However, Hunk easily caught him by the collar of his shirt before lifting him
up into the air, so that his feet didn’t touch the ground. Hunk’s eyes narrowed
and he brought the bully’s face right up to his own.               “You
think you can hurt Keith and get away with it?” He said, still in the calm
voice he always had. “Well, think again. Nobody hurts our friend.” With that,
Hunk grabbed the kid’s shirt with two hands before dunking the kid into a nearby trashcan. Only when the kid was fully
submerged in the trash and staring at Hunk with wide eyes did Hunk back away
and grab a hold of Keith’s hand. He led the other boy out of the cafeteria with
the rest of his lunch in hand.               “I
expect a new chocolate pudding for Keith tomorrow.” Hunk said over his shoulder
and exited the lunchroom. Lance and Pidge followed, each pointing to their eyes
and back at the bullies with two fingers and then back at their eyes, before
they too left the lunchroom.               No one
noticed the small smile on Keith’s lips.x.V.x               Shiro
had been livid when he heard about what had happened. You can bet on it that he
had stormed into the school, furious and raging about the safety of children
and zero tolerance for bullying. Needless to say, the next day Keith had several cups of pudding by his locker,
his bully was suspended and his mouth
didn’t hurt as much anymore.               Unfortunately,
Hunk had gotten detention for throwing a kid in the trash can but Shiro had
slid the boy a ten for his work and thanked Hunk for what he did for Keith.
Hunk’s smile was enough of thanks for Shiro.               Keith
smiled, braces and all and thought: Maybe
this won’t be too awful.

anonymous asked:I'm rewatching Shameless and it's made me realize how much I really dislike Lip. He gives terrible advice and the only time he complimented Mickey was when they were bringing Ian back from the hospital. Do you like Lip? And or what are your thoughts on Lip? See, I just about never liked Lip. When I first started this show it was because my girlfriend’s co-workers kept freaking out about the show and primarily Lip, and when she mentioned it I remember everyone on my facebook freaking out about Lip, so I said “yeah, okay. Let’s try the first episode!” I ended up loving Ian, Fiona, and V right away rather than Lip.Lip was okay (just okay) for the first… idk 4 episodes and then I didn’t like him as much anymore and he just kept going downhill from there for me. Let’s talk about our buddy Lip for a second, though.He’s rude, conceited, arrogant, and somehow for someone who is so smart, he is so stupid! He treats his female friends and girlfriends like garbage and then is surprised when they move on from him after he is suddenly comfortable showing his feelings (this has happened with Karen and Mandy and even to an extent Amanda) then tries to drag them back in only to want out the second things look promising for a good strong connection.He clearly loved Karen but only wanted her for sex and treated her like a whore. This is more sad than a negative but it directly correlates to how he then treated Mandy, so I feel like the pattern here translates this into a really sad fault, but a fault nonetheless. The main part that pissed me off about his relationship with Mandy was when Mandy was going to Indiana with Kenyatta, Ian asked Lip to try to convince her to stay. His idea of convincing her was giving her his magic dick to just enchant her into wanting to stay despite the fact that he refused any promise of a relationship after they were done having sex this time around. He grabbed her by the face and, sure, said some sweet things… But let’s be honest for a second: was he actually putting any effort into getting her to stay? NO! What the fuck did he offer her as incentive to stay? He thought he’d say some nice words, rock her world for thirty minutes, and then tell her not to go and that she’d be putty for him. Sorry, Lip. I doubt your Johnson is THAT amazing. I HIGHLY doubt it. And then he acted surprised when she left anyway. Just… the arrogance there is disgusting. Seriously. Disgusting.He treats Fiona like shit after season 4, and some people don’t blame him, but I do. Even after she’s paid her debt to society Lip still acts like he has any room to judge Fiona for her questionable behavior. When Fiona got in trouble for Liam and Lip takes over as Liam’s caregiver, I honest to god think he only did it to the degree that he did to get girls’ attention. It’s no coincidence to me that just two episodes prior he was being shot down by everyone except someone who is clearly easy UNTIL he took Liam with him to school. No doubt he started taking Liam with him everywhere because he couldn’t drop him off at daycare and surely couldn’t trust Fiona completely, but after an episode it was definitely more of him trying to get positive recognition for being a man who takes care of children (because he’s been doing everything wrong at college and he feels in need of some recognition and validation). He keeps insisting that he’s southside and college life isn’t going to change him except he starts acting like he is too good for his neighborhood and his own family pretty damn quick, and kind of kick-started Fiona’s cunty behavior in season 6 and 7 by trying to make her feel like she is stupid or a failure (and he did the same thing when she went back for her GED).The only good I can say about Lip is he called Ian on the bullshit double standard he and the rest of the angry mob had about the female pedophile (though he took that experience to get laid as well), he finally gave Mickey some credit for helping Ian and starts to believe in their relationship a little bit, (”You did okay, Mickey. You know, you tried.” “I thought Mickey’d be here”) he’s finally recognizing the Frank in him and is trying to stop himself from becoming Frank now that he’s seeing it and when it comes down to it (but it has to come down to it) he will support and defend his family like no one else.I still don’t understand why people care for Lip so much, but hey, to each their own. Some people don’t see the redeeming qualities of Mickey that I see so I’m sure there are some redeeming qualities on Lip that I’m just not seeing, too.Thanks for the question, Anon! At least you and I are in the same boat! &lt;3
