    Summary
      It's funny how things often don't go as one would expect. Like it's the world trying to screw someone over or like it's trying to drive someone crazy. Wilbur never expected to be in this position. This position where he's starting to go mad. Maybe it's already happened. He doesn't think so, but everyone around him was looking at him like it had.
So what if he'd just blown up the festival? Of course he did. He was the bad guy now, right? That's what was being made of him. Was it crazy of him to play out his role? And yet, here he was, Tommy holding a sword to his neck, Dream not far behind, and Techno being tended to by Niki after their fight a few minutes ago. The festival was in ashes, but nobody had died. He'd done his role... But... 
How did he get here again? What drove him to this..? When had this pressure in his head started to become something worse?
This isn't a super good description, tbh, but it works! Basically, this is Wilbur looking back on his time in the SMP, going over what changed him and made him turn into Villbur. Hope you enjoy :D

    Summary
      Wilbur and Dream had been in a war on the SMP for content but even so the tension between them grew outside of the game. When they later meet for the first time after the war the tension stays between them and soon leads them sneaking away from the convention they are at to be with each other. The question is, is it a hook up or more? And how will their friends react when they are always sneaking away to meet behind closed doors?

    Summary
  Tommy was close enough to see the white ceramic plate of his mask. That horrific, emotionless, godforsaken mask the man wore to cover his face each time he went into battle. The enemy raised his shield vainly, his body curled like a spring, preparing to jump into the safety of the waters below.
  But as their heartbeat pumped in terrified tandem, both faces of the war knew there would not be enough reaction time to prevent what was going to happen.
  In the last millisecond, Tommy swore he saw Dream’s life flash across his eyes behind the vintage of the dead smile.
“DREAM WATCH OUT!! -”—
Fatally injured by the minecart Tommy accidentally sent his way, the fate of the enemy faction’s very leader was now left in the hands of L’manberg. 
Yet, Dream once showed them no mercy. So who were they to do otherwise?

    Summary
      Tubbo, overwhelmed by the stress of the war retreats to a wood clearing, the same clearing he went to when there was no war at all. The boy hid himself away from the rest of l’Manberg, he’d come back to the walls when he felt okay enough to do so, he could defend himself if the need arose after all.Then, his greatest enemy stumbles into the clearing, seeking the same peace as he had, instead of attacking him however, Dream decided to comfort the clearly distressed boy. Aka how Tubbo found himself family in someone he first thought to be his greatest enemy.

    Summary
      SAD-ist was known at her school for being awfully blunt, or in other terms truthful.She just can't help it! Sometimes her thoughts just slip out of her mouth, then she meets him, who despite not being in the best mood, accepts her for who she is. SAD-ist was sometimes bullied by other students at her school, since some people just can't accept the truth.Dream fights off some very shady men who had more ill intentions rather than 'just' a bully from school towards SAD-ist."Man with a smiling mask axes some thugs to defend a girl with a frowny mask, kinky."-Sapnap 203X

    Summary
   “I don’t know if farming that long is something to be proud of.” 
   “They said the same thing about destroying orphans and bullying people,” Techno retorts. He gestures to the front door where he had not-so-rudely kicked them out and tosses his hair back, making sure not to flinch when his braid slaps him back in the face. Wilbur spares him his dignity and stifles a laugh. “But here I am.” 
The potato war ends, a famine begins, and it just so happens that Techno’s got a fuck ton of potatoes that’s enough to feed the whole country except for one minor detail—nobody wants to eat them.

    No Archive Warnings ApplyEarl of Lemongrab/Lumpy Space PrincessEarl of Lemongrab Lumpy Space PrincessMinecraft so we back in the mine got our pick axe swinging side to side creeper? aw man! this takes place in whatever alternate reality the minecraft special takes place in diamonds and lemons this is for pure silly fun don't take it too seriously Fluff also while all lemongrabs are autistic this one has echolalia in chapter 1 lol
    Summary
      I am personally vindicated that Lemongrab and LSP both appeared in the Diamonds and Lemons special and both exist in the minecraft Adventure Time crossover reality... yet we never saw them interact? What the hell is this? I'm victimised. So anyway this will be a collection of lumpygrab oneshots starring their minecraft versions. They're gonna build a house and put their beds together in it because I said so. Chapter 1 - building a house (in Minecraft)

    Summary
      "Woah, hey," Sapnap grabs onto George's shoulders. "Worrying won't fix anything. Dream's a lot of things, but he isn't stupid; a dumbass, for sure, but he knows better than to not have a respawn set up. If the worst happens, he knows where to find us.".Dream doesn't make it back home before sunset. That never happens.
