You only have a 7-hour workday?  :O  And why do you change again at the office?

Well, 7-ish hours, on the current project.  Some days lunch is shorter, some days I arrive earlier or leave later ... and every now and then they need me outside of regular hours or on a weekend (fortunately not in the office, though) - so there's a bit of flexibility on both sides.As for changing - the ride is about 22km, and I get hot and sweaty :)Also, anything but cycling gear would be too uncomfortable for that distance, and I'd be hotter and sweatier, so, shower &amp; change at both ends for me.

Oh wow, I hadn't realized you were cycling to work!  That makes a lot of sense now.
