I’ve shot this without looking through the viewfinder and completely messed up the composition.. but somehow that’s the reason why I like it so much. My Instagram: @_kjosh &lt;326917#35mm #film #friends

I just scanned like 15 new rolls of film and realized that the average mood of my photography has completely changed compared to a few months back. Even in the past I was never really interested in taking melancholic pictures. All I wanted to do was to express how I perceive life.. and looking at my pictures today (I just posted one or two of them) makes me even more happy. Some people would say that they look cheesy, but thats just how I feel right now and I would always prefer tacky over sad. Thank you photography5716#35mm #film #friends #photography

I don’t want to be so negative. I want to tell you how exciting everyday things can be and talk about the stuff we could do together. But its 3 am and and I sit on my desk while you are out there. Thats everything I can say right now. Im sorry. But I know that it will be different by tomorrow. When the sun is up and you are sleeping.// Note from 15.02.18467#35mm #film #thoughts #notebook #friends #photography

Im forever in love with how life in general seems so complex and frightening, but when you look for it, theres always something well-ordered and beautiful to hold on to. Instagram1466#35mm #film #friends #thoughts 
April, 2018We are at Lennys apartment watching music videos. He starts to talk about his neighbor, how crazy his apartment is and stories about previous visits. Its hard to believe him so we end up knocking at his neighbors door. Its a weird situation. Everyone is drunk and I hold onto my camera as hard as I can. He opens the door and greets us like we knew each other forever. Lenny wasn’t exaggerating. The smoking machine smells like vanilla and I never heard that kind of music before. My friends are dancing and joking around while he is mixing drinks in the kitchen. I hide behind my camera and try to look like I have fun. But I know that my face looks like I would rather be somewhere else. Like so many times before, I find myself torn between the desire to live and to be left alone.594#thoughts #diary #35mm #film #friends
