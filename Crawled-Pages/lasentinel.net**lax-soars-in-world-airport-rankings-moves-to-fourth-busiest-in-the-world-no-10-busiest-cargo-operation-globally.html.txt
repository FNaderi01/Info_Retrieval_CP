LAX Soars in World Airport Rankings, Moves to Fourth Busiest in the World, No. 10 Busiest Cargo Operation Globally            
				By Sentinel News Service

Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) has regained its position as the fourth busiest commercial airport in the world, while also growing in the global rankings for its cargo operations, according to Airports Council International (ACI) World data released, which can be viewed here.
According to ACI World, LAX has surpassed Tokyo-Haneda Airport to become No. 4 in the world for overall passenger traffic and remains the second busiest airport in the United States. In 2018, LAX served a record 87.5 million guests, an increase of 3.5 percent from 2017.
“Los Angeles is a global crossroads and a place where everybody is welcome,” said Mayor Eric Garcetti. “From reimagining our airport infrastructure to opening new routes that connect our city to the world, LAX’s ascent is just another reminder that Los Angeles is continually reaching new heights.”
        ADVERTISEMENT        
“Los Angeles is a leading international destination for commerce and leisure travel, and the continued growth of passenger and cargo traffic in 2018 further affirms the importance of our global airport,” said Deborah Flint, Chief Executive Officer, LAWA. “LAX’s record number of passengers and rise in world rankings is a testament to the discernible modernization and innovation that is underway, and the gold-standard service we take great pride in delivering”
LAX’s total passenger count for 2018 was 87,534,384 travelers, comprised of 61,480,817 domestic passengers (up from 59,614,616 in 2017) and 26,053,567 international passengers (compared to 24,944,160 in 2017).
The increase in passenger traffic is attributable to guest demand, increased aircraft sizes, and an expansion of destinations offered by LAX’s airline partners. From 2014 to 2018, LAX added 21 new airlines and 36 new nonstop routes to international destinations. Passenger traffic has grown consistently during this period, maintaining LAX’s position as the second-busiest commercial airport in the country. In 2018, new routes included Shenyang and Xian, China; and Buenos Aries. New domestic routes included Arcata/Eureka, Calif., and Flagstaff, Ariz.
In 2023, many passengers will get to experience the LAX Landside Access Modernization Program (LAMP), which will reduce traffic in LAX’s central terminal area and provide a variety of easier ways to enter the airport. Upon completion, guests will enjoy a 2.25-mile elevated automated people mover (APM) that will connect LAX to a brand new consolidated rent-a-car facility and Los Angeles County Metropolitian Transit Authority’s regional light rail system across six APM stations.
LAX’s world ranking for cargo operations also jumped three spaces to become No. 10 for the most cargo tonnage processed. In 2018, LAX processed a total of 2.2 million metric tons, an increase of 2.4 percent over 2017.
LAX’s 2018 cargo figure of 2,209,850 millon metric tons breaks its previous record of 2.158 million metric tons in 2017. This increase reflects the critical role that LAX serves as a conduit for trade in the United States and beyond.
Every day, more than 1,200 flights carrying cargo arrive and depart from LAX. More than half of this number is international trade, served by carriers from the Asia-Pacific, North American, Latin American, European, and Middle Eastern regions. Cargo includes shipments sent on any one of the dedicated cargo airlines that land at LAX, or in the bellies of passenger aircraft.
LAX has more than 2.1 million square feet of space devoted to air cargo across 194 acres. The airport is home to the largest airport refrigeration facility and perishable center on the U.S. West Coast, maintained by Mercury Air Cargo, at a size of 12,700 square feet. FedEx also has an LAX presence with one of its major regional cargo centers. The LA-area cargo trade also engages more than 800 freight forwarders and 360 customs house brokers, who are in the L.A. area to expedite the region’s air cargo delivery.
LAWA is in the midst of modernizing its cargo facilities with the Century Cargo Redevelopment project, which will allow LAWA to maintain and enhance LAX’s air cargo market position among United States airports and the world. The aims of the project are to solicit innovative design and operational concepts which will allow LAWA to continue to modernize its LAX air cargo functionality and provide for additional capacity to help meet current and anticipated demand, including the creation of the first ever vertical cargo facility in the U.S.
