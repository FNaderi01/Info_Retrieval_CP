    Summary
      Akaashi Keiji had nowhere to go.Kuroo Tetsurou had extra space.Bokuto Koutarou was flexible.Kozume Kenma should’ve chosen better roommates.When Kuroo found something unexpected on a patrol, he volunteered without telling his roommates. So you could imagine their reaction when he came home with a child unannounced. Kuroo thought it'd be okay. Bokuto wanted to be friends. Kenma wanted to know how to take care of a child, because if he didn’t do it, who would? They started from nowhere, but they’ll grow from there.

    Summary
      “Are you always awake at this time?”
Akaashi blinked at Tsukishima as he wiped down a nearby table, tearing his gaze away from his laptop where he’d been furiously typing for hours nonstop. “What?” 
“It’s nearly one in the morning, you’ve been here at this time and even later consistently the last two weeks.”
--
in which sometimes we believe the lies our minds tell us, something that Akaashi Keiji is no stranger to.
