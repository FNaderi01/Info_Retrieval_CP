		Pasadena Councilman John Kennedy brings Christmas Joy to District 3
		Next »
	Christmas came a little early in Pasadena.  A community holiday celebration hosted by Pasadena Councilman John J Kennedy was an overwhelming success bringing holiday cheer to children and needy families throughout Pasadena.
Kennedy’s Annual Christmas event featured a visit from Santa Clause who provided each and every boy or girl a gift.  Food was also plentiful with food brought in from a variety of local restaurants including El Portal Restaurant &amp; La Sasssier Catering from Los Angeles.
The event also features visits from Pasadena Mayor Terry Tornek, Congresswoman Judy Chu, Pasadena Police Chief John Perez &amp; Fire Captain Bertral Washington.  One of the biggest highlights of the day was when local residents got to meet and interact with this year’s Tournament of Roses Royal Court.
        ADVERTISEMENT        
“We are truly Blessed and have so much to be Thankful for, living in this wonderful city (Pasadena).  This is just a way for me and many of the local businesses who support this event every year to give back to the city and community we all care so deeply about” states Councilman John J Kennedy- District 3.
