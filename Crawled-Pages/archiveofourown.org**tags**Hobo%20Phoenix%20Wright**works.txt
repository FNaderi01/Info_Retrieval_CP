    Summary
      This story delves into the mystery of where the HELL Maya Fey and Miles Edgeworth were when Phoenix Wright's world collapsed around him post disbarment and WHY they weren't at his side during Phoenix's darkest hour for those long seven years. Join Phoenix, Maya, Miles, Franziska and the rest of your favourite Ace Attorney characters for nearly a decade and experience with them both their laughter and tears, as they discover life's bittersweet truths: sometimes love isn't enough to mean happily ever after, all the money in the world can't necessarily fix all tragedies, justice doesn't always prevail, and broken hearts heal...but can they ever truly mend? Follows the Ace Attorney Timeline for the most part and goes through AJ to Post DD. Slight spoilers for all games. This is the final installment of the Turnabout Lawful Love Trilogy and takes place right where Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman ended. The story starts pre-Apollo Justice, right before Phoenix's disbarment. Official part 3 of the Turnabout Lawful Love Trilogy.

    Summary

    Summary
      Phoenix harbours no illusions that getting his badge back is going to be an easy task, even if the hardest part of clearing his name is technically over. He's fully aware that his reinstatement is going to be a bit more complicated than just passing the bar and is going to be more of a case of:
Step 1: Save money to retake bar examStep 2: Study frantically to pass said bar examStep 3: Pass bar examStep 4: Hope and pray that he'll somehow be able to still pull in clients after his reputation got burned to the groundStep 5: HaircutStep 6: New suitStep 7: Finally, finally confess his passionate love for Edgeworth that has been eating him up inside for the past 25 yearsStep 8: ???? Lawyer???
Thankfully he has a pretty solid support network of people willing to help him out. And if Edgeworth has anything to say about it, they'll probably be able to cut out a few of those steps along the way.
Which is why Phoenix promises himself one thing. If he passes the bar again, he is absolutely going to kiss the Chief Prosecutor square on the lips. Whatever happens after that, they'll just have to wait and see.
