He’s breathing loudly, panting. His left shoulder is wet and dark with blood; the stuff is dripping down the back of his hand and off of his fingers, small red droplets hitting the ground and leaving a trail as he walks. His face is pale and bruised and he’s shaking. It’s a miracle he makes it to the front desk without collapsing.  Keep reading

                                                Whumptober #10: They Look So Pretty When They Bleed
                                                                        promptsforyourwhumpfic

Its late, everyone has gone to bed and there’s only a skeleton crew doing security patrols. They’re bleeding from countless wounds, their broken nose gushes and leaves a small, spattered trail barely visible in the dim light. The slices on their arms cause messy hand prints on the walls as they attempt to steady themselves while one clutches at their stomach, mindful of the broken ribs but desperate to slow the bleeding. They stumble and fall not too far from medical; they trip on their own feet and smack the ground with a harsh thud, barely able to conceal their pained groan. They’re found in the late morning, after a teammate followed the trail of blood from the open fire-escape door to the place that A is laying.

Because of her inexperience, the older members thought it would serve her well to sit in on any and all proceedings. They also took advantage of her kindness to saddle her with the unwanted paperwork that mounted up on her desk. With all the clerical work she was responsible for she felt more like a glorified secretary than the rightful heir to the Shiemihaza. Though she dressed the part and even learned how to conduct herself as such, she still felt like she was just a girl doing mundane tasks. For all the supposed power she possessed, she still was victim to human ordeals such as exhaustion and paper cuts. “Ow!” She yelped as the edge of the paper sliced her finger tip. It was a decent sized cut, causing a trickle of crimson blood to trail down her finger. She dropped the paper onto her desk and pulled her hand away, being careful not to let blood drip onto the files. Using her other hand, she opened the front compartment of her desk and dug through her things to look for something to wrap the wound in. Only she was stopped when a new hand grabbed her wrist and bent her arm backwards. The blonde girl let out a gasp as she turned to see who had captured her bleeding hand. Her emerald eyes widened as she took in the intruder. “Amaimon!” The green demon king ignored her surprised excellmation, instead blinking curiously at the cut on her finger. “You’re bleeding,” he stated plainly. Before Shiemi could answer, he moved her finger to his mouth. His long, lizard-like tongue slipped out between his lips and he slowly licked the warm blood off the pad of her finger. Shiemi sat there dumbfounded and blushing profusely at the strangely intimate act. After swiping his tongue over her fingertip, he slipped her finger into his mouth, sucking lightly on it. She wanted to pull away, but was frozen in place by her pure shock at his sudden boldness. She didn’t know how to respond, so she sat silent with her mouth gaping while he finished cleaning her cut. With a resounding pop, he released her finger and her hand fell back down to her lap. She looked down at it and saw that the cut had stopped bleeding but her finger was still wet. She brushed her hand on her white silk robes. “Y-you shouldn’t be here, Amai.” She finally grew the courage to speak again. The king of earth licked his lips as he jumped up on her desk. The wooden desk and all its contents shook under his weight as he sat with his legs crossed. “I came to visit my bride,” he said evenly. “And it’s a good thing I did, seeing as left alone you end up injuring yourself.” Shiemi’s cheeks heated up in embarrassment. “You should be more careful,” he continued. “Blood as precious as yours should not be spilled so easily.” In his words hung a thinly veiled threat. “You shouldn’t be here,” the girl repeated. Amaimon looked at her for a moment, contemplating his next move. Tension built up between them as Shiemi met his stare. In her younger days she would never be able stand up to him like this, but over the years she had become better at showing her true feelings. Her assertive nature growing inside her. Amaimon realized she was not going to relent. He let out a heavy sigh. “Fiiiine,” he dragged on, hopping down from the desk. He stopped in front of her and bent down, putting his hands on either side of her and tapping her in her seat. He leaned in close to her face and whispered, “Try not to hurt yourself again, I may not be as forgiving about it the next time.” His warning caused Shiemi to lose her nerve. “G-get out!” She shouted at him. The demon king kept a straight face, but did as he was told. He backed away from her and went to her opened window. He jumped out the window the same way he came. The sweet taste of her blood leaving with him.
