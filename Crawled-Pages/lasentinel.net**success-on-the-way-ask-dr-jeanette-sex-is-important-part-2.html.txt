Success On “The Way” Ask Dr. Jeanette-Sex Is Important!? Part 2            
				By Dr. Jeanette Grattan Parker

Women have sexual needs too. While some men may think sex first and who’s next, their wife’s sexual and romantic needs go unmet. You can’t serve two masters. Men and women need to think about their mate’s sexual needs before practicing on others. Consider the value of the relationship, sexual and other emotional needs. Some men evaluate their masculinity by their sexual prowess. “Testosterone is an important male hormone mostly produced in the testicles; responsible for building muscles, bone mass and stimulating sperm production. It’s levels factor into male sex drive. Restless legs syndrome (RLS), the uncontrollable urge to move your legs; study found that men with Restless Leg Syndrome-RLS are at higher risk for developing erectile dysfunction than those without RLS. ED occurs when a man can’t have or maintain an erection. Men who had RLS episodes more frequently were even more likely to become impotent;  considered to have low testosterone, [low T], when levels fall below 300 to 350 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL). When testosterone levels decrease, desire for sex decreases. Decreasing testosterone is a normal part of aging. Pray. Supplements may increase your testosterone levels, others can lower testosterone levels…may lead to low libido; e.g. blood pressure medications may prevent ejaculation and erections. Depression changes all parts of a person’s life. People with depression experience a reduced or complete lack of interest in activities they once found pleasurable, including sex. Talk to your doctor. Testosterone levels are linked to libido and at their highest with men in their late teens. Men generally notice a difference in their libido around ages 60 to 65, [Mayo Clinic]. Erections may not be as strong. Distraction by high pressure, may decrease sexual desire. Arteries can narrow in times of stress, restricting blood flow and can potentially cause erectile dysfunction. Today, men and women want sexual adventure, one night stands..immediate gratification. Loyalty is displaced. Publicity of sex show offs: purported sex violations escapades, Bill Cosby, Harvey Weinstein; Morgan Freeman [CNN Story]” (Kristi Turnquist@oregonian.com OregonLive The Oregonian). Why would men who have everything “risk everything,” even “life.” It’s dysfunctionality in moral equilibrium; given to sensual gratification, disregard for others.  What is the message to the public? Get married, stay faithful in your marriage and figure out how to make the best of sex within Godly boundaries, where the marriage bed is undefiled…if you keep on messing around you’re gonna get caught and won’t even have the words to speak or lawyers to help get you out of the mess.  Help! Help!  Almighty God!” Parts of the article quoted from HealthLine and  from www.familylife.com articles: Help for Today: Hope for Tomorrow website Christian Radio Broadcast: KKLA. A CRU Ministry. (Kristi Turnquist@oregonian.com) OregonLive The Oregonian).  And HealthLine [online]  [Jeanette Grattan Parker Askdrjeanette.successontheway@gmail.com Superintendent/Founder Today’s Fresh Start Charter School www.todaysfreshstart.org  Recommended reading:Starting Your Marriage Right © 2000 by Dennis and Barbara Rainey.
