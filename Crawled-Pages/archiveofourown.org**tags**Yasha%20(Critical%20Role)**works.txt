    Summary
      After Traveler Con The Mighty Nein receives a special invitation to a Ball hosted at the city of Whitestone. A mix of excitement and constant suspicious worries flow through their minds. 
Never trust anything.
“Jester, this is Allura Vysoren. It has come to my attention that the Mighty Nein has helped a very dear friend of mine once more.”  The message started in her head, Jester's heart beating faster, before she is able to respond another message came through. “When I had heard you had saved my dear friend’s mother, I was speechless. As a thank you you have all been invited to a ball.”
“By Lord Percival de Rolo of Whitestone and Lady Vex'ahlia, Baroness of the Third House of Whitestone and Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt.”
“They will send you a proper invitation soon."

    Summary
      Separated by the explosion of the Tide's Breath, both Fjord and Caleb must find each other again. Fjord is armed now with powers he could never dream of, and as he gathers a small cadre around him, his determination to recover Caleb only grows stronger. But the prison that surrounds Caleb is more than just bars, and Caleb can barely think about escaping when he must fight purely to hold onto who he is. Fjord will let nothing and no one stop him from finding his lost love, but who he rescues might not be Caleb anymore. He might not even be human.

    Summary
      The rental was too good to be true; a fully furnished four bedroom house in a decent neighborhood at an astonishingly low rent. They knew there had to be some kind of catch somewhere, but with the end of their lease fast approaching, Molly, Beau and Yasha didn't really have a whole lot of options. But they could afford it, so they made up their minds to deal with whatever the problem turned out to be.Of course, of all the problems it could have turned out to be, this was not what they had been expecting.

    Summary
      Caleb sits in the doorway, twitching his tail a bit as he spots Mittens – the orange tabby who likely brought them their midnight snack – has settled down the table next to Caduceus. Clearly, he’s enjoying the firbolg’s gentle head rubs and back scratches. Caleb would snort a bit in jealousy as he thinks back to Jester fawning over the fluffy orange cat a couple days ago. 
Where Caleb uses polymorph to wander around the tower and check on his friends as a cat - what he learns is how much his found family cares for him and that maybe love and affection are something he can become accustomed to again.

    Summary
      From a tumblr prompt by luckyjak:"Polymorph is a 4th level transmutation spell. It’s not like disguise self; it’s not an illusion. The body physically transforms. Beau and Jester decide to fool around while Beau is in her male tiefling form, and there are consequences. aka the Beau-knocks-Jester-up fic literally nobody asked for."After an awkward encounter in their Xhorhaus bedroom, Jester admits she's frustrated by her sexual inexperience. Beau knows how to treat a lady - what's a little Polymorph between friends?What they don't expect, as the Mighty Nein hunt down the next beacon and begin their infiltration of the Empire, is a bump in the road. Beau doesn't do feelings, and she definitely doesn't do falling for straight girls, but there's something growing between them that's getting harder and harder to ignore.

    Summary
      After the Traveling Carnival of Curiosities settles in Rexxentrum, Yasha and Mollymauk are visited by two Empire agents, investigating Yasha under false pretenses. They are thrust into an ongoing war, forced to either take a side or run away. -------------Mage Bren Ermendrud and Expositor Beauregard Lionett work as allied investigators for the Empire's crown. They get a fairly usual warrant to look into Xhorhasian Yasha Nydoorin's visit of the Empire, but the investigation cracks open hidden reserves of doubts in both Beau and Bren, and pushes the depths of their loyalties. -------------An AU in which Molly, Yasha, Caleb and Beau are just doing their jobs, until they can't afford to do just that anymore.
