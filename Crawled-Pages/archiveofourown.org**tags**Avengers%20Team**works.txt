    Summary
      Finding out about his parents' murder at the hand of the Winter Soldier, Captain America's old war buddy, pushes Tony Stark into a very dark place and he turns to the former HYDRA assassin with a burning fury, part of him screaming for revenge.Finding out that Steve knew and didn't tell him pushes him over the edge and he lashes out against the super soldier, but just as Steve is about to retaliate the Winter Soldier takes Tony by surprise, by knocking Steve out and surrendering.The Winter Soldier knows that to be free HYDRA must be crushed, and for that to happen his best chance is the resources of Tony Stark, when Captain America shows up in Bucharest the fragmented memories of who he once was tells him that the Captain will protect him and bring him to the Avengers so the Asset goes with him, but when the Captain is about to attack Iron Man with deadly intent he makes a choice and goes against the voices within.The Asset neutralizes the Captain and surrenders to Iron Man, hoping that he will be able to convince the man to use HYDRA's own weapon to take them down.

    Summary
      "You would risk exposure to save me?" She looked down and nodded, unable to meet his eye. 'Why?""Do you know Elvish Your Highness?" "Of course.""Then you know why."~ ~ ~Once thought to be extinct, the Dark Elves, lead by the infernal Malekith, seek to invade Asgard. Made aware of their presence and the looming threat to his people, Odin Allfather sends out a call to the far corners of the Realm Eternal. The call to arms. Every able bodied man is to report for duty to repel the invaders. Her brother is no different. And yet he is. Permanently injured during the last war, he is unable to fight, yet is determined to do so. For the honour of the family. Unable to allow such a thing, she takes his place, unknown to her family until it is too late. Thrust into the heart of a war, her mettle is tested. For she hides more than who she is. Will her lies hold out when confronted by the Silvertongued Prince himself? Or will they crumble and all her secrets be brought to light?

      Sometimes you just need that push to seek a new adventure. For Raina Wilson, it was a chance meeting at a park and a much-needed road trip. For Amara Johnson, it was a discovery that led her into a world she could only dream of. But to every adventure, no matter how sought, there is always danger.NOTE: Prequel to events in the Breaking Boundaries &amp; Spark of Life Stories, but you don't' need to read them to read this

    Summary
      Harry had an extended family through his father that he never knew of, it was a secret to everyone. His father's mother had a sister, by the name of Fae Dragomir. She hid in the mortal world and fled to America, where she had her pureblooded daughter Vithoria Dragomir and her half-blooded daughter, Guinevere Dragomir-Stark, who is the daughter of Tony Stark. Before she gave birth to her children, she went to a hidden place in America where witches can evolve through spells, and in turn, their children will inherit the advanced abilities. Well, the Dragomir sisters did. They eventually grew up and joined the Avengers when Loki's attack killed their mother and other witches of their coven. So when Ultron came after them after her father created him, they had no choice to battle. But when Guin went back for Wanda after seeing Pietro shot, she became caught in the other witch's power and instead of being killed, she ended up being sent back in time. When in time? Back to when her cousin Harry Potter was at Hogwarts, and when being stuck there, Guin finds friends and love and has to make a decision on if to go back and keep history the same or to trust her heart and change wizarding history forever.

    Summary
      As Peter’s consciousness sobered up, he was beginning to notice the distant ache in his arm more and more. His brows connected in a frown and he moved his arm around for him to see, only for the view to make his heart drop in his chest.Near the center of his wrist were three boxy letters tattooed into his skin: 019.—Peter is taken by HYDRA and is forced to undergo and survive in the hostile environment of painful experiments and difficult missions. For every day that passes he loses part of himself, that is until she comes along. A little girl, and she calls herself Morgan. Together, will they be able to escape? All he knows is that he will do anything to protect her, anything.*UPDATES: For now, every day! ;)* btw I suck at summaries so hopefully this is a bit more exciting to read than it seems...
