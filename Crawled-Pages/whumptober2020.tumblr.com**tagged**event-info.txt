As we explained previously, the archive is random and not a complete list of every work produced for the eventWe are not affiliated with the whumptober-2020 blog that has popped up. While we totally support side competitions, using the same name as our event is not appreciated and we will not be reblogging content produced for this parallel event.¬†We‚Äôre going to start tagging all archived posts with¬†‚Äúarchive‚Äù if you would like to continue following the blog but don‚Äôt necessarily want to see all the archived posts on your dash. To avoid confusion with the other event, we recommend using the tag #whumptober2020 without the space.Please read the FAQs before sending us an ask, especially now that the event is running and we‚Äôre swamped.All the 2020 Event Info that was pinned to the top of the page is now under the cut below so you don‚Äôt have to scroll past that big ol post when you visit.You can also visit our nifty little official Event Info page!Happy Whumping!Keep reading

                                                            Can we get started on the prompts now or do we have to wait until October? (Also, just double checking, we don't have to do the prompts in order, right?)
                                                        You can get started whenever you want. It‚Äôs why we posted the prompts a month early :)You don‚Äôt have to do them in any order. Just keep in mind if you did no. 1 on oct 31st there‚Äôs a good chance it won‚Äôt get archived.
