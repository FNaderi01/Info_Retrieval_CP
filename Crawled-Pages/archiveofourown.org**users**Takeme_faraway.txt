    Summary
      It had always been within a gentleman's favor to find a bride that will be both suitable of class and wealth. This fact rang throughout England and was instilled in children from a young age. For those already married and have neither grand status or illustrious wealth, it was in their best interest to wish for their offspring's success in finding a marital partner. Or, a Pride and Prejudice inspired story with Draco as Elizabeth and Harry as Mr. Darcy
