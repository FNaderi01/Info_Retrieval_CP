    A Classic
Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2013Verified Purchase
  I've read only a bit of Joan Aiken's work, but I think she was a genius. Her series of children's books beginning with THE WOLVES OF WILLOUGHBY CHASE - at least the ones I've read - range from "pretty good" to "absolute classic".This is the best of what I've read in the series, although I haven't read them all. Early books relied a bit overmuch, I think, on parodying classic literature (although they're all quite decent, don't get me wrong, and a couple, THE CUCKOO TREE and THE STOLEN LAKE, are excellent) but DIDO seems to be pretty much its own thing. For those who know the series, this feels like the culmination of the Dido Thwaite story, as she returns to England, stops yet another plot on the King's life, and brings her difficult relationship with her father to a kind of conclusion. (Indeed, I wonder if this was not a personal story for Aiken, as despite all the fantastic goings-on the central concern of the book does seem to be Dido's relationship with her father. Aiken explores the notion of how a great artist can be a terrible human being - Aiken's own father was a fairly famous poet, I have no idea if he was a terrible human being but the similarity in situation seems pretty stark.)All that makes it sound more dreary than it really is. Actually DIDO AND PA is a wonderfully lively book, complete with plots and counterplots, conspiracies both evil and good, a genuinely charming love affair (actually sort of a couple), some action, and some genuinely weird moments here and there - even a touch of the supernatural that grows as the story reaches its conclusion. Aiken, as I said, was a genius, she had a gift for a very quiet absurdist kind of humor and almost complete tonal control that was really masterful - this is one of the few books I know of where transitions from humor to horror to pathos are completely plausible.These are marvelous books, highly recommended.

    Wonderful fun

  Another delightful adventure for Dido, Simon and new friends. Aiken's wit and breakneck plotting guarantee a charming experience from this addition to the series.

    Dido in her element
Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2004
  At long last Dido Twite is back in London, though perhaps not as she anticipated she'd be.  Unexpectedly reunited (much to her delight) with her old friend Simon, now the Sixth Duke of Battersea, she has been spirited away from him by her rascally father Abednego, who with most of his family killed in the destruction of Battersea Castle has become Music Master to the Hanoverian Ambassador.  The position is not unearned--for all his bad qualities, Mr. Twite is a brilliant composer and a performer of note on the hoboy, whose music often brightened Dido's younger days even though he always favored her much older sister Penny.  But, quite naturally, the Ambassador is also a pivotal player in the ongoing Hanoverian plots against the Stuart throne, so Mr. Twite's politics mesh nicely with his employer's.  Unfortunately for them both, "Bonnie Prince Georgie" (the King George IV of our universe) has recently died without issue, so what's a Hanoverian plotter to do?  The answer's plain: find a way to become the power behind the throne.  And this the Ambassador has done, with a Dutch double for King Richard IV.  With the help of a network of street urchins and a young artist who is in love with Simon's sister Sophie, Dido contrives once again to foil the plot, though not without a few near escapes, and in the process is reunited with Penny and with what seems to be a younger half-sister, the oddly-named Is.  She is also overlooked by a blind apple seller who has a gift of foreseeing and declares that he "can see crossed sparkling lines over her head, and a whole shower of lucky stars...a gold crown in her hand...and a velvet carpet under her foot."  Take good care of her, he warns Mr. Twite, or the luck will turn for you...The high point of this installment in the Wolves Chronicles is the quirky relationship between Dido and her father, which is portrayed in a rich series of vignettes between them, cunningly spotted along the course of the tale to provide breaks in the otherwise headlong action.  Aiken also shows her usual Dickensian gift in her portrayal of London street life and her creation of villains you love to hate--though Mr. Twite has his sympathetic moments.  As the book closes, he has met the fate the apple-seller warned him of, Sophie and her gallant have come to an understanding, and Simon shyly suggests that perhaps Dido will "think about being Duchess of Battersea one day."  A satisfying conclusion to Dido's extended globe-trotting.

    Grim sequel to 'The Stolen Lake'
Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 1999
  This was a somewhat disappointing episode in a wonderful series, though I have never read the previous two stories, 'The Cuckoo Tree' or 'The Stolen Lake', the first two parts, 'Black Hearts in Battersea' and 'Nightbirds on  Nantucket', were wonderful.  Of course it's really just for  children...The redoubtable Dido Twite returns from her adventures in the  Atlantic to reunite with Simon (now a Duke) in London, where she finds that  once again her nefarious musician father is up to his eyebrows in  'Hanoverian' plots against the Stuart throne.  The tale is crammed with  incident as Dido and Simon fight the machinations of Abednego Twite and his  patron, the evil Margrave Eisengrim.  The appearant foundling Is, who (in  the next novel) proves to be the daughter of Dido's unhappy sister  Penelope, is also introduced.All Aiken's adventures contain dark edges  and disturbing images but in previous novels they were counterbalanced by a  more inventive goodness and optimism - although it has to be admitted that  'The Wolves of Willoughby Chase' was a pretty tough cookie for a juvenile  adventure.  With 'Dido and Pa' the series has become somewhat stale and the  characters more routine - though still superior to most of Aiken's  competition.  Perhaps as a result the Dickensian environment of cruelty and  misery becomes more oppressive, which together with the 'just desserts'  experienced by the villians makes the novel grim reading for the grade  school set.
