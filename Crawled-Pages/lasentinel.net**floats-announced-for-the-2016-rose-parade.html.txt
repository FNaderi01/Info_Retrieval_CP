Floats Announced for the 2016 Rose Parade            
				By Dr. Valerie Wardlaw, Contributing Writer                
	                	                Published December 2, 2015
		With less than 100 days to go, the Pasadena Tournament of Roses announced the floats for the 127th Rose Parade presented by Honda. Ken Burns, an award winning filmmaker and President of the Tournament of Roses, Mike Matthiessen, will lead this year’s parade as Grand Marshal.
Burns, 62, a winner of 14 Emmys, two Grammys, and two Oscar nominations is considered a “legendary figure and a great fit for this year’s Rose Parade theme, ‘Find Your Adventure,” according to Tournament President Mike Matthiessen. “We’re so honored to have someone like Ken, who has devoted his life to telling the story of America, lead the Rose Parade – America’s New Year Celebration – that provides hope and joy to millions of people around the world.”
‘Find Your Adventure,’ the theme for the 127th Rose Parade grew out of a partnership between the Pasadena Tournament of Roses and the U.S. National Park Service. The 2016 Rose Parade will help spotlight the centennial celebration of our nation’s national parks. This year’s floats along with their builders are listed in alphabetical order:
