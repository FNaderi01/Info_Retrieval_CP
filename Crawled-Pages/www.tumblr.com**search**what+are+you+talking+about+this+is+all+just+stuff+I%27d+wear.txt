(He’s probably pre-teen-ish around here, maybe, idk)Yasha still more or less thinks of himself as a boy (when he can be bothered to think about it at all) but loves flowers, pastels, and anything soft and gentle (in harsh contrast to his blunt as a bludgeon personality). And most importantly, he kinda just really hates wearing pants and underwear, when he can get away with full nudity… He takes the young!Victor flower fairy aesthetic to the next level. He can be very picky about what he wears, and usually prefers expensive but relatively unknown specialty brands. His parents, especially Victor, are more than happy to indulge his tastes.~~IF YOU ARE NEW TO THIS AU: It’s a Yuri!!! on Ice AU, Yuuri-centric with end-game polyamory in an ABO

anonymous asked:Just wanted to let you know your writing is AMAZING.  dunno if you take requests or not but if you do I'd love one of protective kuroo, kind of like the akaashi fic you did!  I know you just did a kuroo one (which was also amazing, I loved it) but I'm a kuroo girl so i can't get enough haha Keep readingThank you so much for the kind words! I am taking requests on top of the other stuff I’m writing:) everyone is low key a Kuroo girl and if someone disagrees with that they can fight me lmao just kidding! But here you go! I hope you enjoy the story:)Originally posted by hq-kurootetsurou~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~You hummed softly to yourself as you watched your legs swing back and forth, the bench you were sitting on kept your feet off the ground. You looked around and sighed softly, Kuroo was running late.  It had been a long time since you guys had gone on a date, he was busy preparing for the Spring Tournament, and you were busy with your extra college prep courses. So when he had suggested going to the amusement park that recently opened up, you definitely couldn’t refuse.  You were waiting in front of the entrance for Kuroo to arrive, considering he was the one who had bought the tickets. “Y/n!” you heard the familiar voice of your boyfriend call out. You looked up to see him waving an arm in the air, smiling at you. Behind him you saw Kenma grumbling to himself as he stuffed his hands further into the hoodie he was wearing. Your lips twitched in amusement. That was probably why he was late. “Hi Kenma!” you said brightly once they reached you, wrapping the second year in a tight hug. “Hi Y/n.” he mumbled quietly, softly returning the hug.  “Oi! Why does Kenma get a hug before your boyfriend?” Kuroo grumbled, an annoyed expression taking over his features. “Because Kenma wasn’t the one who was late.” you retorted, sticking out your tongue.  He huffed angrily and reached a hand out to grab you away from the setter, only for you to slap his hand away, continuing to cling to the pudding haired male. “Damn you Kenma!”  “Be quiet Kuroo.” Kenma sighed. “I didn’t even want to go. You dragged me out of the house.” “That’s because if I didn’t you’d be stuck inside all day playing video games. It’s good to have fun once in a while.” Kuroo stated simply, finally pulling you away from his teammate and into his arms. “Playing video games is fun Kuroo.” Kenma shot back, taking out his phone. “Besides, isn’t this supposed to be a date? Why would you have me tag along? You and Y/n haven’t spent much time together recently.” he glanced up looking between the two of you. You had forgotten about your annoyance towards Kuroo for being late now that you were wrapped up in his arms. Right now you were incredibly content as you leaned against his tall form. “It’ll be fun Kenma! I haven’t seen you much either. Let’s go enjoy the park together!” You said happily. You had known the two boys since you were in middle school, and quite frankly once you had started dating Kuroo you kind of expected Kenma to be there half the time. They were a package deal, and you honestly didn’t mind, sometimes preferring the quiet second year’s presence more than your boyfriend’s. Kenma sighed in defeat and trailed after you guys as you made the way to the counter to hand in your tickets. Once you guys were actually inside the park Kenma seemed to have perked up just a bit. You talked animatedly towards Kuroo about what you wanted to do for the day. Your hands intertwined together as you spoke. You hadn’t noticed the soft gaze that came over the tall third year. Kuroo couldn’t help but to stare at you. It had definitely been too long since the last time you guys got to be together. He missed you terribly. He missed the ridiculous facial expressions that came over your face when you were talking, he missed the way you pouted whenever he teased you, he missed the way you would play with your long hair whenever you were nervous.  Fuck, he just missed you entirely. He felt guilty about how busy he was with the volleyball club, feeling like he was being a terrible boyfriend for neglecting you for so long. But you understood completely, you knew how important volleyball was to him and you just wanted to be able to give him unconditional love and support.  Plus, those extra courses were brutal. While you loved spending time with Kuroo, you also knew how incredibly distracting he was during homework. So you were grateful for the time apart to get everything done. “Do you guys want food?” Kuroo asked, staring at the food stalls. You guys had finished riding the thrill rides, and playing most of the game stalls at the park.  You were having a wonderful time, and there were those rare moments where you saw Kenma smiling to himself, he had the most fun playing the stall games, and he was actually pretty good at it. He had won the majority of the prices that were now in your grasp. Much to Kuroo’s distaste.  But Kuroo had won you a black cat plushy. Despite the frustration he felt at only being able to win you the small stuffed animal, the look on your face was worth it.  He had never seen anything more beautiful; the way your eyes lit up and the wide smile that stretched across your face. It was definitely worth it. Especially when you declared that the cat’s name was going to be Tetsu.  While Kuroo went off to go get food, you and Kenma found a place to sit. “You’re really good at those shooting games Kenma.” You stated, sitting across from the quiet male. He looked up at you from his phone and smiled slightly. “It’s not that hard, it’s just like some of the video games I play.” “I suck at video games.” you sighed, frowning slightly. “Tetsuro always makes fun of me because of it.” “I know.” “Don’t be mean.” you pouted. Kenma laughed slightly at your expression before closing his phone and standing up. “I’m going to the restroom real quick, are you going to be okay by yourself?” Kenma asked. You waved him off as you settled down into your seat. You would be fine, this was an amusement park afterall. Nothing bad ever happened at these kinds of places right? You were wrong. You were definitely wrong about that statement.  It had only been a couple of minutes of being alone before an arm draped over your shoulders.  You stiffened and looked to see a guy around your age sitting next to you. His friend sitting  across from you. “What’s a cute girl like you sitting all alone for? Did your boyfriend leave you?” he teased.  You frowned, shifting your body away from the male. “No. He went to go get us food.”  “Where? I don’t see him.” his friend said looking around halfheartedly. “Why don’t you come hang out with us?” You glanced around to see that people weren’t paying attention to the uncomfortable situation you were in.  And Kuroo and Kenma were still gone… “No thanks. I suggest you leave before my boyfriend gets here.” you said dryly, crossing your arms over your chest. A hard expression covering your face. “Oh come on, don’t be like that.” the one that was sitting next to you cooed, shifting closer to you and grabbing your chin. “We can show you a real good time…” You flinched away from his touch, fear and annoyance overtaking your body.  While you didn’t tolerate being talked to this way, it was still incredibly scary considering that you were outmatched right now.You ignored the feeling of dread sinking deep within your stomach and was about to start telling off the two males when a tray full of food was slammed down in front of you, causing you to jump in fright. “What the fuck do you think you’re doing to my girlfriend?”  You had never seen Kuroo so pissed before. His cat-like eyes were piercing as they glared down at the unwelcomed males. His expression was dark and angry.  It was a frightening image to behold. Behind the angry and towering male was Kenma. His eyes watching the two males with a calculating expression before flickering over to you, walking from around Kuroo he stood next to you, carefully pressing his hand against your elbow and tugging you gently away from the table.  Kuroo’s eyes briefly moved to yours checking to make sure you were okay and not hurt before moving back to the males that were beginning to look frightened. Kuroo’s confrontation finally brought other eyes to your area, the people around you looking on which made the harassers even more nervous. “Do you two losers usually go around touching girls that don’t want to be touched?” Kuroo asked coldly, this caused an eruption of whispers to take place around you guys, older adults getting ready to step into the situation. “How about I show you guys a good time…” he said darkly, cracking the knuckles of his right hand. You have never seen boys run away as fast as they just did.  You released the breath you had apparently been holding during that encounter. You watched Kuroo’s expression go from dark and cold to loving and worried as he turned his attention to you. “You okay doll?” he asked gently cupping your face.  You nodded softly. “Y-Yeah. Let’s eat. I don’t want this to ruin our day.” you smiled slightly.Kuroo stared at you for a moment before nodding slowly. He shared a pointed look with Kenma but didn’t press the matter further. You were definitely not okay. ********** All too soon the day had ended. You and Kuroo found yourselves outside of your house. “Do you want to come in? My parents won’t be home until later tonight.” you said quietly. “Oya? Are you trying to seduce me Y/n-chan?” Kuroo smirked leaning down towards you. You flushed brightly, slapping his chest. “Shut up Tetsuro. Do you want to come in or not?” He laughed loudly at your embarrassed face. “Fine. Fine.” You rolled your eyes as you guys stepped into your house. It wasn’t the first time Kuroo had been to your home, he immediately made himself comfortable as he went upstairs to your bedroom. “I feel gross. Will you be fine out here if I go shower?” you asked, setting down the prizes you had gotten at the park. Kuroo dismissed you as he picked up one of your comics you had laying around, making himself comfortable on top of your bed. You rolled your eyes as you left to the bathroom after grabbing a change of clothes. Kuroo felt his phone buzz in his pocket.  Don’t leave Y/n alone tonight. She definitely wasn’t okay after what had happened. Kenma texted. Kuroo frowned and glanced towards the closed bedroom door, he knew that you weren’t okay. If he was being honest, the rest of the day he was waiting for you to break down crying. Kuroo knew that you were a strong person, that was one of the many things he loved about you. But a situation like that, would leave anyone frightened. He noticed that too, the way you would jump slightly at his sudden touch, and the way that you would glance around worriedly. Of course he wasn’t going to leave you alone tonight. Before that had happened he had planned on coming over anyway, he wanted to spend as much time with you as possible, and considering that tomorrow was the weekend, he thought it was the perfect time.  Kuroo didn’t notice you walk in until you plopped yourself on the bed, drying your damp hair. He smirked slightly as he took in your clothes, your soft legs were exposed due to the shorts you opted to wear to bed, and his familiar volleyball shirt hung down your body. “Did you steal that?” he teased, setting down the comic book. “I was wondering where that shirt went.” “Nooo…” you said, averting your eyes. “You left it here.” “Lying doesn’t suit your sweet face doll,” Kuroo drawled out, sitting up from the many pillows on your bed and clasping warm fingers around your wrist. “Who knew that my girlfriend was a thief.” he smirked and yanked you into his lap. You fell into him with a loud ‘oomph,’ your face squishing against his hard chest, and then you melted against him. Sighing softly to yourself, you shifted against him comfortably, straddling his hips as you wrapped your arms around his muscular shoulders, your head laying against his chest. Kuroo’s hands rested on your upper thighs carefully, thumbs rubbing gentle circles into the skin. You both were quiet for a moment, just appreciating the comfort and warmth of being in each other’s arms. “You know, you don’t have to act tough around me right?” he said suddenly. “I know what happened earlier freaked you out.”You stiffened and relaxed against his chest. Kuroo just knew you too well. “Yeah.” you said quietly. “I just didn’t want you to worry… and I didn’t want to ruin the day…” You remembered the way that guy had touched you so casually, and despite the shower you had taken, and the way you had all but scrubbed your skin raw, you still felt gross. Kuroo sighed, pushing you back slightly so he could stare at your face. “I already know that you’re a crybaby. Kenma does too. You’re forgetting that we’ve known each other since we were kids.” he said bluntly. You huffed angrily at his statement and whacked his chest with your palm, causing a wide smirk to appear on his face. “I’m not a crybaby!” “If you’re not feeling okay, it’s okay to tell us,” he finished, ignoring you completely. “It’s okay to tell me, because I’m always going to take care of you. Yeah?” The sincerity in his voice and the gentle expression on his handsome face caused you to blush. Your eyes moved away from his and settled on staring at his chin as you tried to get your racing heart under control. Your fingers played with his hair at the nape of his neck. The way you felt about Kuroo was indescribable, the admiration and adoration you had for the third year volleyball captain was too much. It felt like your heart was about to explode from how much you just loved him. “Thank you Tetsuro.” You said finally meeting his gaze. “I love you a lot.” you confessed. He smiled gently at you, pressing a warm kiss to your forehead. “I love you too.” It was quiet for a moment as you rested your head against his shoulder, breathing in his familiar scent. “If you want to thank me properly, you should take off your shirt. Well actually it’s my shirt.” …. “Shut up Tetsuro or I’ll tell Kenma.“

Movie Night (ft. Cas’s t-shirt)THANK YOU for the ask, Dear Anon! I’m very flattered that you enjoyed the last one, and hope this meets your expectations! I WISH I could tag you in this, but you’re on anon so.. Anyways, I went for Tuesday movie night idea, and clubbed it with a ‘cute t-shirt prompt’ I received and it got long AF but please leave a comment if you read and like!*“Ahh,” Dean let out a perfect sound of exhaustion meeting the plush comfort of his couch. “It’s finally Tuesday.”Sam snorted from the side, because his relationship with tuesdays had been kind of a love-hate. Not that Dean ever took him seriously - he doesn’t blame his brother, really, because he wouldn’t believe Dean either if he told him ’a piano crushed you to death’ or any of those other ridiculous ways in which he’d died. “If you like movie nights that much,” Jack added, from the side - he was settled in  one of the big chairs, looking more like a kid than he usually did. “Why don’t we watch movies on other nights, too?”Sam leaped to answer, ever ready to squeeze in a lesson for the nephilim. Good values needed to be a part of the upbringing. Children need to be taught by example. “There’s an analogy we can use for this, Jack. Say, uh, Dean loves his birthday very much.” Dean frowned at his brother. “Because of the pie, and the gifts, and all the beer.” Dean shrugged. “So, he wishes on his birthday candles that everyday be his birthday!” Sam paused, and Dean wondered why he spoke as if he was talking to a kid, and not the strongest 2-year-old ever. “But, what happens then, is that he keeps growing a year older on each birthday - that is, everyday!”Jack looked alarmed. “That’s - bad.”“Yeah, because then I’d grow to be 60 in like a month and die.” Dean added, in a deadpan.“It won’t take you thirty years to get to sixty.” Sam reminded him.“Shut up, Sam.” Dean scowled and turned back to Jack. “Listen, kid, this isn’t about all the good movies in the world getting finished too soon, if we watch 'em everyday. It’s more about the attitude.”Jack nodded.“Like, uh,” Dean swallowed. “Like our dad always taught me and Sammy, hunters need to live a disciplined life. Can’t just start watching a movie whenever, because that’ll make your head feel like you’re giving it permission to do crap, just like that, without a routine. That’s never good for a hunter - even less so, he’d say, for the sons of an ex-Marine. Messes your head up, and takes away your ability to fixate on your decisions.” Dean paused. “It’s not like I’ve not watched movies on a Saturday because I wanted to, but the old man made sense - it’s just, a routine is better to stick to.”“That sounds like a horrible amount of behavioral psychology to associate to an activity as trivial as watching a movie.” Came a new voice, as Cas stood in the doorframe, his head just slightly tilted as his eyes looked straight at Dean.Dean’s exhale was caught in his lungs, and he blinked, staring at Cas with a chest full of air, and still feeling like he’d sink instead of buoyant. Cas was no longer in the trenchcoat and pants - he wore grey pyjamas which fit snug over his thighs, and a t-shirt which had to be new, because holy fucking shit.He’d have noticed the angel walking around their bunker, wearing a black AC/DC shirt like that - simple, to someone else, perhaps - yet the way it fit over his biceps, widened his shoulders a bit more, and gave an elevated look to his chest because of the smooth descent to a toned abdomen - rendered Dean incapable of looking away. Complete with his hair sticking up at odd angles, hints of a stubble and inspecting eyes focussed on Dean, he looked like the stuff of Dean’s (guilty, oh so guilty) dreams.“H-hey, Cas.” Dean cleared his throat, shifting on the larger couch to make space for him. He waved his hand dismissively to disregard all that he’d just said. “Forget about that, it was crap - come sit down.” He suggested, breathlessly.“Look who finally joined us,” Sam addressed, in a normal voice and not even bothering to look up again - making Dean wonder why he didn’t get all caught up in Cas’s t-shirt, like Dean just had. He was unfairly attractive - but not just to Dean, right?“I’m sorry,” Cas replied, as he sat down next to Dean. Not a single part of them touched, since they were on opposite edges of a large couch Dean originally got for Sam and him - but there was still a tingling under Dean’s skin, which had to be Cas’s fault. “I couldn’t find any socks.” He turned to Dean, suddenly smiled, and tugged his pyjama up a little to show him the socks he wore. A pair of fucking novelty socks, they were - but Dean found himself grinning mindlessly, as Cas crossed his legs under him, and the visual was taken away from him.“Of course, you couldn’t.” Sam inputted. “Dean hasn’t been doing the laundry lately.”“Why am I the only one supposed to do it?” Dean threw back, and Sam didn’t say anything to it.“Nevermind.” Cas declared. “I found socks, unwashed though they may be. Let us start.” He referred to the movie.Jack had fell silent for a moment, and he spoke up again. “Yeah! What are we watching today?”At the same time that Sam opened his mouth - probably to drag Dean on how they better not watch something they’d just watched - Dean spoke up. “We’re watching The Fellowship of The Ring, today.”“We just watched that on literally the third Tuesday of March -” Sam complained.“Listen.” Dean threw back. “Don’t shove your crazy awesome memory with movies and dates, in my face - 'cause my brain forgot the movie already.”“Forgot? You probably can quote it line by line, Dean.” Sam frowned. “But I guess you’re not satisfied until you flawlessly recite it in your sleep, like Lost Boys.”Dean flashed his best shit-eating grin, and if that’s what he was gonna do, he wasn’t gonna agree with Sam. “Well, it’s what we’re watching, Sammy. Deal with it.”Sam narrowed his eyes. “What about Jack? Or Cas? Why don’t you ask them if they want to watch Lord of the Rings again?”“I do.” Jack announced, brightly. “I like Frodo and Samwise Gamgee.” Sam rolled his eyes. “But, I could also watch something else. I trust Sam’s recommendations, after Harry Potter.” He added, faithfully.“Careful, buddy, Sammy’s raising your son to be a nerd.” Dean muttered to Cas, and he nodded, as if it was a line that needed to be answered with a nod.Sam grinned like it was victory handed to him on a platter. “He said he could watch something else, Dean.”“What about Cas?” Dean turned to him, rotating in his seat. “Whadd'ya wanna watch, buddy?”Cas pursed his lips, as if in deep thought. The deciding element. The one who’d tip the scales in the favor of one of the Winchesters. “It’s not Sophie’s Choice,” Sam grumbled sourly, as if he already knew what Cas would choose.“Let him think!” Dean shushed his brother.“I have reached a decision.” Cas informed everyone, looking solemnly at the TV, instead of their faces. “We shall watch The Fellowship Of The Ring, tonight.” He turned to Sam. “And if there’s no hunts and we’re at the bunker tomorrow too, Sam’s choice shall prevail - that is, if Dean agrees to go against John’s sayings and watch a movie on a Wednesday.”“That’s fair.” Jack grinned.Dean beamed at Cas, with his little smile and his goddamn t-shirt, which was gonna drive Dean crazy in due time, he was sure. “See, Sam?” He ignored the comment on his father, because it was rare stilted humor, and in a perfect deadpan. Sam muttered something under his breath which sounded a little bit like 'profound bond’ for some reason, and rolled his eyes in defeated agreement, as Dean began to look for the movie.“Whatever,” Sam substituted, not looking up from his phone as the opening credits began to play. “The three of you can rewatch the entire LOTR series if you want, I’ll just leave you to it.” He shrugged.“Hey!” Dean was annoyed. This was family movie night. Sam was supposed to be a part of it too. “Lord of the Rings is right up your alley, nerd. Why’re you bitch-facing so hard tonight?”“Well,” Sam chewed on his lip. “It’s very long, and I wanted to get to bed for an early night.”Dean narrowed his eyes, and hit pause on the remote just as the elves began to narrate. “Why?”“No reason.” Sam stalled. There was an almost familiar edge to his voice and - Suddenly, it all made sense to Dean. The dots connected in his head, and Sam’s reluctance to watch a three hours long movie was suddenly reasoned.“Why, Sam?” Cas repeated, intrigued. “Are you alright? Do you not feel well?”“He feels fine. I know,” Dean cut in. “He’s got a date.” Sam’s eyes widened before he vigorously shook his head in denial. “Some virtual crap, I bet, because you don’t like to get laid, and an actual date may’ve involved that - but whatever is your idea of a fun time, hey, I’m not judging.”“It’s not a date!” He declared. “Then it’s something like it.” Dean shrugged, getting surer, with Sam’s panicked expression. He knew his brother well enough to read through this cover. “Tell me Sammy, is this a video call with some chick you met online on those awful sites?”“Dude, no.” Sam balked. “I’m on no such awful site to meet chicks.”“Sure, you’re not.” Dean narrowed his eyes. “Then, who? Because clearly I’m right about the rest of it.”“It’s,” Sam looked like he didn’t wanna continue, would like nothing better than to not finish the sentence. But with Cas joining in on the stare, he let out a subdued, “Uh, Rowena.”There was a stillness in the room. Dean and Cas slowly exchanged a look, and Sam flushed. “Who?”“We know her, Dean!” Jack corrected, promptly.“Not like Sam does,” Dean shot at his brother, who looked flustered as crap, and it was all Dean had ever wanted from this conversation.“Dean!” Sam looked grossed out, while it should’ve been them. He was the one dating a three hundred years old witch. “We’re gonna discuss -”“- if you’re about to tell me you’ll discuss a case, I swear to call you on your bullshit by calling Rowena right away.” Dean challenged, definitely.“I -” Sam pursed his lips. “I don’t need to have this conversation with you, jerk.”“What about the rest of us?” Cas asked, and there was a smirk playing on his lips, which made him all the more attractive.“None of you.” Sam declared, standing up, looking offended. “You are literally infants! Don’t breathe a word of this to anyone, Dean, or I’ll - whatever, just watch your frigging movie, I’m out of here.”“If you’re gonna do stuff, use headphones!” Dean waited until Sam was far enough to not hit Dean for it and yelled after him, as the latter marched out of the room, embarrassed. It was his duty as the older brother to make that happen, so no issues there. He turned back to Cas, grinning at him - and Jack, of course.“The rest of us are here without the intention of leaving halfway to call a chick, right?” Dean asked, though it was a pretty stupid question for Jack - and if the answer were yes for Cas, he’d have a major-ass freak out right there. “Right.” Cas confirmed, for some reason; his voice rich and gravelly, and Dean’s attention was once again taken by Cas’s t-shirt - now that his kid brother was sufficiently out of the picture. True, Jack was still there, but that’s a different issue. Dean had to hold a reputation in front of Sam, that he could control his senses in the presence of Cas, and that he could rein it in, and that he could do a lot of things which he was very far from, in reality. “Me too.” Jack announced, brightly, and Dean rolled his eyes. “Jack, you’re two.” Cas informed him, and Dean had to stifle a snort at the very notion. Nevertheless, he toned down the weird, made himself comfortable in the couch - maybe shifting a little towards the middle, and let out a small, content sigh, for the second time this evening.He hit play. *“Why do we keep making the same mistake?” Dean groaned, his head falling back on the sofa. Once again, like every tuesday ever - they’d forgotten to get food before they sat to watch the movie. Now, around half an hour in, it was all Dean could think about. But getting up seemed like an awful chore.Cas nodded his head in agreement, grave and earnest. “It’s because we don’t learn our lesson.”“Dean, do you want to learn said lesson tonight, by not eating?” Jack asked.“No.” Dean glared at him. “I may be around Mr. No-Food, and Little-to-no-food, but it isn’t wearing off on me.” They’d not paused the movie to have this discussion, so he kept his eyes on the screen as he spoke. “As a human, I have a few simple needs. Such as beer and something like popcorn to chew as I watch a classic with my - I mean, with you guys.”“Okay.“ Cas shuffled in his seat, beginning to stand up. Dean frowned instantly, and pulled him down, gripping his wrist. Cas easily succumbed, and was back on the couch with a surprised little bounce - looking at Dean, confused. "What? I’ll get you the beer and popcorn, so that you don’t have to get up. I can obviously see you don’t want to.”Aww, Dean’s brain melted. “Nope.” He said, out loud, popping the 'p’. “You don’t need to do that. I’ll go.”“I volunteer, Dean. It’s not about need,” Cas protested. “And you enjoy this movie more than I do.”“Sure, but I’ve watched it a helluva lot more too.” Dean raised his eyebrows, and Cas smiled a little, one of those smiles that he reserved for Dean, and made his insides flutter. “We could just pause it.” Jack suggested, not looking away from the TV yet, for the entirety of the conversation.“No, you keep watching, there’s no need,” Dean excused, standing up himself, smiling in spite of himself. Cas looked at him, and not at the screen. “Dean,” And that wonderful voice of his swept over Dean’s brain and made the puddle vaporize or some shit. “Yeah, Cas?”“I could keep telling you what’s happening, while you’re in the kitchen.” Cas proposed, breaking into a wider smile, all crinkly and toothy.“Aww, Cas,” Dean couldn’t stop himself in time, staring blindly at Cas’s face and short-circuiting in his head. And instantly cleared his throat, and added in a more composed tone. “Okay, you do that. Thanks, I guess.”Dean wondered, as he walked into the kitchen and went looking for the bacon he’d made earlier, what was up with him tonight. He was usually able to hold his tongue in front of Cas - he was usually able to look away from him, even though it took some persuasion. But there was something today, that had taken away his brain-to-mouth-and-eyes filter. Must be the new shirt.Dean knocked, obnoxiously loud, at Sam’s door before barging in with a plate of bacon and a beer. He saw Sam fast asleep, on his front, and did not know where to go with that, so he left the table at his bedside in case he was going to wake up and resume his midnight call or something.Then he took the rest of the food and two beers and went back to the movie room. All through his venture, Cas had kept yelling updates through the door. “Merry and Pippin just hugged Frodo!”, “And now, Frodo just met Bilbo again!”, “Arwen is speaking with Frodo now!” This had made Dean grin so hard, that he almost dropped the dishes. Damn, Cas was awesome.As Dean handed him a beer, and put the plate of bacon between them on the couch, Cas whispered to him. “And Arwen just kissed Aragorn, son of Arathorn.”And Dean stared at Cas, his blue, blue eyes and his eyebrows pinched together in concentration, and his crinkled nose - and his goddamn voice, and his way of speaking, and how he just said the words 'Aragorn, son of Arathorn’ like an entire fucking dork, and how adorable it was that he’d been doing a live-commentary for Dean, and just - he was almost overpowered by a desire to kiss the perfect little smile tugging at his lips, and palm the stubble-covered cheeks, and maybe, if Jack weren’t here, pull that gorgeous fucking t-shirt over his head, because it was distracting.Dean was instantly taken aback by his own stream of thoughts. He was clearly going crazy. He could bet it was the fault of the shirt.*Okay, but at this moment, Dean needs the remote. And it’s not just because the remote is on the other side, next to Cas, and Dean’s brain instantly launches into a scene in his head, when Dean asks for the remote and Cas is too comfortable (he’s already holding onto a large cushion like it’s a blanket) to move, and he tells Dean to take it himself - and then Dean will have to lean over Cas to get it, and there’ll be a moment where he’s almost on top of him, and they’ll happen to look at each other, and Cas’s eyes will flit down to Dean’s lips as Dean adjusts himself to reach the remote, on Cas’s lap, and maybe Cas says something like -That’s enough.Dean doesn’t need the remote so that something like that plays out in reality. He only needs the remote to lower the volume, because Jack is asleep and he’ll wake up otherwise in the war scene and noise that’ll follow.But this way or that, he can see the said scene happening.Maybe there’s a part of him which wants it to happen exactly how it happened in his head.Maybe it will.So, with more energy than the sentence needed, he says, “Cas! I need the remote!”And Cas turns his head to look at Dean, an incomprehensible expression.But instead of saying a variation of, 'take it yourself’ like he was really, really supposed to -He picks up the remote with his left hand and hands it to Dean simply.Dean stares at it for a moment, everything forgotten, especially the reason why he needed the remote in the first place. And then he kicks himself for being a goddamn teenage girl about this, and plays off the disappointment with a 'thank you’ in the manliest voice he can conjure, and he’s pretty sure it makes up for the kind-of-but-not-really pornography he’d been dreaming up. Sam’s irritating voice nags in his head, you’re confusing reality with porn again.Of course, Dean is too lost thinking and staring at Cas sideways when he’s sure Cas can’t see him - to remember to lower the volume, and Jack wakes up with a jolt at the Uruk-Hai screeching at Gimli the dwarf.*Jack’s going off to his room. The movie isn’t finished yet, but he’s been dosing off throughout and Dean can’t tolerate the insult to the Classic, so he tells him to just go off to sleep. It’s been a long day.“Will you both watch it whole?” Jack asks groggily, before leaving and Dean looks enquiringly at Cas. He only has to turn his head a little, because Cas is much closer to him now. They’ve both gravitated towards the middle.“Of course.” Cas answers. “Unless Dean needs to sleep.” Dean shakes his head confidently, and Jack nods.“Okay, goodnight dads.” He mutters, at least it sounds like it, and Dean would’ve lost it if Cas’s slight weight leaning on his arm weren’t grounding him to his current location instead of somewhere panicky in his head.“Goodnight, Jack.” Dean lets out, and he’s aware it doesn’t sound as constipated as he thought it would, and he’s proud of it.“Dean.” Cas speaks up, a moment later. “I think we should turn off the lights.”“What?” Dean blinks, mildly.“I know neither of us will want to get up later.” Cas justifies. “So we might as well do it now.”“Can’t you,” Dean grumbles. “Can’t you use your mojo to push the switch, or..?”Cas sighs. Then blinks, and the entire room goes dark. Cas’s eyes open, and they’re gleaming like blue halos of light in the suddenly dark room - and Dean can still make out his face, in the light of it. It’s all hard lines and small smiles, from the little he sees. “I need to remember I can do these things, don’t I?” He mumbles.“Yeah, our human incapabilities are wearing off on ya.” Dean tells him and they start looking at the screen again.“You’re not incapable if you have to stand up to turn off the lights.” Cas replies, and Dean just hums in response.A little later, Cas speaks again, and he sounds happier almost. “Dean.”“Uh-huh?” Dean looks away from Gandalf on the screen, to look at the angel.“Did you notice Jack kept falling asleep?” Dean pauses. “Oh.” He smiles too, it coming over him all of a sudden. “Yeah.”“That means,” Cas’s tone is bright, and Dean can hear his smile. “He’s enough human to fall asleep in the middle of a movie, again.”“Human incapabilities strike again,” Dean teases, and Cas chuckles audibly and it’s a really, really good moment. Although yeah, it’s a bit too domestic for Dean to be perfectly at calm - Cas and he are sitting in the dark, watching a movie they’ve watched so many times before, discussing the progress of the nephilim they’ve been raising (with Sam, of course) and Dean has his hand around Cas’s seat - in what he now feels guilty on realizing is the oldest trick in every guy’s playbook. They’re both more in the middle of the couch than not, and the beers have been drained to the last drop. One of them doesn’t sleep, the other won’t - and then there’s Cas’s perfect t-shirt, which shall drive Dean to madness each time he sees it, and beyond.*Slowly, the arm which is on the couch, falls on Cas’s shoulder - and it’s a rather rapid course from there to it being slung around Cas, with Cas tucked under it and leaning into Dean so that it’s comfortable.It’s not that Cas’s head is on Dean’s chest, or not even that his fingers are playing with the fabric of Cas’s shirt - its just that they’re so close to doing that, and somehow Dean can’t pull back this time. Like, he suddenly realizes, he’s been doing forever.It’s again, a good thing that he pretty much knows LOTR scene by scene, and in spite of almost completely being distracted by everything Cas, he answers all trivial questions Cas mumbles at him in that deep, deep baritone - and there’s a heat pooling in Dean’s insides, and he can’t quite place if its the spot behind his ribs, or further south.Both sounds most appropriate.*Dean is not proud of this, but he fell asleep.It’s not that he didn’t finish the movie, because he did - he remembers the last scene (or it could be from a previous watching that he recalls it) but it’s just that he fell asleep right there. Next to Cas. No, not even next to him. Pretty much wrapped around him. And somehow that’s - not so wild, after all. It kinda feels awesome. Its not even morning yet, so he has more hours.He wakes up with his hair tickling his breath and coughs mildly when he realizes that he’d buried his nose in Cas’s hair - and his lips on his head, apparently. He straightens, but is sure to not make much movement - because Cas doesn’t sleep like they do, he rather drifts off to a sorta-catatonic state but stays very much awake and alert. He doesn’t want to wake Cas up, because the angel looks so comfortable, nestled on Dean’s chest - that it somehow invokes a feeling of pride in him.And love.And that’s that. The not-freaking-out segment of this story abruptly comes to an end, and Dean clenches his fist to stop himself from beginning to tremble.He ends up with a fistful of that goddamn shirt which Dean blames for everything in that night, and Cas stirring awake, and straightening. The weight rested on Dean’s abdomen is lost, and it feels weird and colder.“It’s seven minutes to four. Ante Meridiem.” Cas announces, in a voice which is roughened by lack of use.“You should go back to sleep.” Dean begs, because Cas doesn’t need to see Dean get anxious about the whole pile of feelings he’s beginning to feel crushed under.“Dean.” Cas says, in that voice, and straightens some more. He’s at Dean’s height again, and their noses are inches apart, and Cas looks worried about him. “Dean?” He repeats, and he’s concerned, and he’s perfect, and his voice is something else, and the way he looks at him is something else like Dean is worthy of all his attention somehow - and the emotions are brimming and he doesn’t know what to do with them until he -He jerks himself ahead, and grabs Cas’s shirt for good measures, pressing his lips against Cas’s. It’s a moment of bravery, it’s a moment of impulse, and it’s a moment of utter stupidity because Cas doesn’t react -Until he does, and he kisses back, and he’s excited and into it and Dean’s taken aback by his vigor and in awe of his own hands which are grappling at Cas’s t-shirt for friction as he moans into Cas’s mouth.“I blame the t-shirt,” He whines, when they pull away, to look at each other better. And he does.Of course, he’s not an idiot (except for the many times that he is). But what he definitely isn’t, is dense enough to not realize that this had been over ten years in the making.These urges were familiar, and suppressed each time - the sudden feelings were overpowering, except he’d learn to deal with them tactfully, by crushing them with every means possible.But what had changed today and he’d actually acted on it instead of swallowing it, had to be the tee. It fit like magic, and it perfectly showcased his lean, muscled chest - and gave a peak of his collarbones, and if he stretched, his obliques - and it was as black as his hair in the dark, and ah, it had to be the shirt.Because otherwise, he didn’t know what it could be, that had made tonight - today - this.Cas still had his hand on Dean’s bicep. “This one?” He looks down at himself. “I got it from your closet months ago.”“What -”“And, you blame it?” He repeats.“No,” Dean shakes his head, anxiously, truthfully as he captures his lips in a kiss again. Slotting in place against each other, and as loving as they were passionate - he had had no idea that kissing Cas would be this amazing. “I love it. I’m gonna need you to keep wearing it. On Thanksgiving, I’m gonna be thankful for it.”Cas laughs against Dean’s lips, and says something which is lost in the bliss of the moment.Nevermind. He has all the moments after this, to listen to him. But he only has this one, at the end of a Tuesday movie night, to enjoy their first kiss (he’s pretty sure all the short, little kisses just make up one major kiss). So he does.*Edit: Thank you for reading!

            Allura and Lance BROTP Headcanons #2        If Lance is doing Pidge’s hair Allura will sit right next to him with a bunch of hair pins and other stuff in her hair so that Lance can get to them easier. (She’s basically a pincushion with less hurty pins)Allura and Lance will sometimes had a day to just themselves and head on to the beach and swim and try and dunk each other in the water.Allura manages to grab a small white reef tipped shark and holds onto the baby and lets Lance pet them.They let him go and leave, only to return with food/chum for them and they feed the sharks.They went to some tropical islands once and fed the eels there.Allura was not having it, she pretty much stayed out of the water while Lance let them swim and slither across his ankles.He managed to convince her to feed a few and touch one.After a day in the sun they compare skin tones to see who got darker. (Allura usually wins)Sometimes she gets these weird iridescent pink freckles and lance will poke at them to see them shine and change color in the light.You talk shit about Allura she doesn’t really much care, you’re not worth her breath. You talk about Lance however she will fuck your shit up because that boy is worth more than your life and she will demonstrate as much. (And vice versa)The only sweaters Allura wears are from Lance since he knows what she likes and what fabrics are comfortable on her skin.If Lance is having a bad day Allura will splurge on him a bit and take him to all his favorite placesShe uses it as a distraction to keep Lance busy while she has Pidge and Hunk found out why he’s down and who caused it so she can drop kick them to the moon herself. Someone talking about Lance from across the room at whisper sound level and not in a good way.*Allura sliding into the conversation like she just wasn’t on the other side of the building*: I’m sorry what? Could you please repeat that for me? ( ͡ಠ ͜ʖ ͡ಠ)They have sleepovers in Allura’s room just to talk or gossipAllura will show him different movies and shows she has and they watch those and she explains all the jokes and other stuff he doesn’t get.Some nights it’ll get so late Lance just falls asleep on her and Allura will smile and just turn off the tv and make sure that they’re both covered before she falls asleep as well.They wake up the next morning and head down to breakfast and everyone is staring at them because Allura has Lance’s shirt on and Lance has her robe on (It’s soft af okay you’d wear it too if you could I’m sure)Hunk: Um…are you guys??? *points at their clothes*They each look down and Lance is fucking laughing his ass off within the first two seconds and Allura is trying to hold it in but she’s failing and in tears at this point.Allura finds it even funnier than it is because she’s 100% aware of Lance’s crush on Keith even if he isn’t quite up to speed himself.

            Binding and posture        Everyone talks about binding and rib damage, and that’s really important. But no one talks about binding and shoulder blades. Now disclaimer I’m not an expert on anything whatsoever, not even close but this is my thinking based on my own experience and inference. Consider this: you’re a pre-op transmasculine person with bad posture, like most people who bind. Your shoulders roll forward and hunch to conceal your chest. I mean no judgment, this is just how it is to have chest dysphoria. Some facts about shoulders: when your shoulders are rolled forward, your shoulder blades wing out. When your chest is out and your shoulders are back, your shoulder blades retract. Try it right now in the mirror with just your binder on. Imma tell you from experience that having your shoulder blades in that winged out position all the time is really not good for them. Some of your tendons lengthen, others shorten, and that starts to be your normal position, and it’s a bitch to put them back. Now consider this: you’re wearing a binder for 8 hours a day with your shoulders in this position. Your binder is squeezing your shoulder blades, essentially pressing them further into this unhealthy position. Basically what I’m saying is, while everyone can get fucked from having bad posture, people who bind are gonna get fucked a lot more easily than other people.So to people who bind: try to have as good posture as you can handle, ESPECIALLY when you’re binding. Listen I’m not here to preach. I know it’s incredibly hard and psychologically taxing to have good posture when you’re trying desperately to hide your chest, and if I could go back and make myself try harder, I don’t know that I would. I just want people to have the information. So here are some tips for good posture that not everyone knows:Let’s start basic. Chest out, shoulders back and down. Pretend you’re fucking proud of your chest, or at least not as ashamed of it as you feel.Traps should be relaxed, no shrugging.Core slightly engaged, breathing without shrugging.Glutes a lil engaged, but don’t go too hard lol.Now things start to get a little weird. Stand up normally with your hands at your sides, and look at your thumbs. Little shits are pointing at each other aren’t they. Ideally, they should be pointing forward. Fucking wild, I know. Don’t just twist your wrists and say “look they’re pointing forward I fixed it!” It needs to come from your shoulders and lats. This is fucking hard to do. Focus on improvement rather than an immediate 100% fix.Lats engaged. That’s the muscle that you would use if you tried to bring your elbows together through your body. Engaging your lats will pretty much instantly turn your thumbs out somewhat.Try this: push on the front of your shoulder using your opposite-hand fingers, and let your shoulder go with the push. Then try to keep it there. (It might crack. That’s ok as long as it doesn’t hurt.)Look at your shoulders in the mirror. Are they level? Try to make them level.If a lot of this shit is really hard for you, you might just have really tight muscles in your upper torso. Get a massage if you can afford it, or look up ways to massage yourself.Some of this stuff varies from person to person but I think these are good as general rules? If someone more knowledgeable about literally anything wants to add to this, please do. I’m pretty much just regurgitating what my trainer tells me, but also he thinks I’m a cis guy and has no idea how I fucked myself up so bad lol.tl;dr: People who bind are at a greater risk of bad posture related injuries. I know it’s hard but try to have good posture when you bind. Read the bullets for good posture tips.

anonymous asked:So like a lot of people like YouTube couples and stuff, right? What do you think how would RFA and Saeran react to MC turning out to be a YouTuber, maybe even inviting them into a video? Like what kind of video would they make and stuff like that. I'd really love to see your spin on things. Thanks for the hard work :3Bless you, anon. This is the shit I am talking about! I tried to make this as diverse as possible, so the HC’s look quite different for each of them|| REQUEST ARE (ALWAYS) OPEN!! ||Zen♬ as
an actor Zen has to know how to handle media♬ platforms
like Twitter, Tumblr and Facebook have a big impact on his career♬ they
also give him the chance to see what his fans (and haters) think
about him♬ still,
all the time he was merely an observer 
♬ he
never even considered possibly going on YouTube and making videos♬ until
he caught you filming a video for your channel♬ you’d
been a little embarrassed about it, mainly because you’d kept it a
secret for so long♬ it
just sounded sort of…strange to say that you were a professional
YouTube♬ but
with over 15 Million subscribers you were good in the game♬ it
took Zen days to wrap his head around that number♬ 15
Million people just waiting for you to put up a video once a week♬ when
you told him just how much you earned on top of that, he was shook♬ Zen
was obviously very happy for your success, but a small, ugly part of
him was jealous♬ he’d
only dream of that big of a number of people admiring him♬ you
could tell how much it was wearing down on him and you felt horrible♬ you
didn’t have to work half as hard as Zen and still had the bigger
following♬ that
is when you got the idea; you asked him to join you for a video♬ after
talking it over with his agency you set the video up♬ the
two of you still weren’t allowed to hint at the fact that you were
dating, but you were allowed to be friends and continue to make
videos should they be a hit♬ after
a while of discussing the two of you had decided on covering a song
together 
♬ you
both knew that a romantic song was out of question so the decision
didn’t take long 
♬ the
two of you covered 7 years by Lukas Graham♬ you
sat beside each other, making the music together while singing at the
same time♬ your
voices sounded perfect together and neither of you could stop smiling
and stealing glances♬ once
up the video went viral extremely fast♬ some
people were fans of Zen, happy to hear him sing on YouTube, others
now turned into fans♬ his
popularity grew more and more with every day♬ so
much so that people started demanding he start his own YouTube
channel or become a fixed part of your channel♬ you
wouldn’t have minded that at all and apparently Zen agreed♬ while
his agency didn’t allow him to start his own channel they did agree
to more collaborations♬ so,
you turned Friday into Collab-Day, posting a new song with Zen every
week♬ Zen
popularity reached it’s peak when producers and agency got more and
more drawn to him♬ he
could barely fend off job offers♬ about
a year after your first collab he was supposed to star in 5 movies
and had changed agencies♬ more
specifically to one that was more acceptant of your relationship and
didn’t demand hiding it♬ when
he proposed to you he did it through song, during a video for the
whole world to know♬ after
that you started a second channel, just the two of you♬ you
posted everything on there, from music to vlogs♬ but
the very first video was a little collage of your wedding and honey
moonYoosung★ you see Yoosung is one of those people who follow Let’s Play type of channels, gamers like himself★ the thing about those is though that a lot of them don’t show their faces (take Cry for example)★ you were one of those so even after meeting you, he had no idea that you were a YouTuber★ let alone the infamous SediLusiVici, one of the most famous gamers and the one he’d been following religiously for years now★ he finds out in the – for him – most shocking and surprising way possible★ SediLusiVici was having a collab with PewDiePie and the two of you decided to play LOLOL★ PewDiePie suggested to attack the top three players of which two were none other than Seven and of course Yoosung★ when he’d suggested that you’d laughed, telling PewDiePie that number one was one of your best friends and number two was your husband★ Yoosung’s face had completely frozen as he stared at the screen, PewDiePie gasping in the background as you laughed your ass off★ “You’re kidding, right?”★ “No, man, I’m serious. I know both of them. I know their real names and what they do for a living and stuff like that and Yoosung is my real life husband.”★ “Daaaamn…wanna ruin their top rankings?”★ “You betcha, bro!”★ so for about an hour Yoosung watched the two of you climb and climb in rankings until SediLusiVici had kicked HackerGod and SupremeYoosung from their respective spots on the top★ it was as shocking as it was mesmerizing★ by the time you came home from work Yoosung was still staring at the opened video★ you greeted him cheerfully until you noticed what he was watching and blushed★ “Fuck…I didn’t know you watched…that…”★ you didn’t really fight about it, nor was he mad that you’d messed up his game, but he couldn’t believe that you never told him you were his absolutely favourite YouTuber?!★ you were flattered and happy he liked your work and decided to invite him into a video★ especially as a lot of people had requested a video of husband and wife together★ of course Yoosung said yes and a couple of days later you started a Stream★ you introduced your husband to your community and took the time to answer some of their questions★ everyone was actually rather excited to get to know Yoosung as well!★ Yoosung was shy about it at first, but very happy too★ so many people actually admired him for his gaming skills!★ in that video the two of you took the time to take down HackerGod together, laughing the entire time★ it would be rather funny to read what Seven had to say about this once he saw he’d been defeated★ twice…★ with you on top and Yoosung back to second place you ended the stream★ it was one of your most watched videos ever★ after that you collab quite a lot, sometimes even Seven joins in★ it’s usually you and Seven ganging up on Yoosung★ he’s always grumpy about it★ the fandom finds it hilarious★ of course it’s all in good fun ;)Jaehee♨ she
found out in the probably most anti-climatic way♨ you
straight up asked her whether you wanted her to post a little add on
your YouTube channel♨ you
thought that maybe it would bring in some more customers♨ she’d
agreed, of course♨ the
idea was brilliant and wouldn’t cost either of you any money♨ what
she didn’t really know was just how big your channel was♨ and
just how much revenue it would bring to the cafe♨ merely
a couple of days after you told her you posted it, there wasn’t a
minute the cafe wasn’t packed♨ everyone
wanted to try out that cafe you’d talked about in your latest blog♨ when
it dawned on Jaehee just how popular you were she also realized that
you must be putting a lot fo effort into your blog♨ but
when?♨ you
worked together and lived together♨ you
told her that you used the nights to record as to not disturb her♨ the
money you used mainly for bills or to invest into the cafe♨ Jaehee’s
heart melted when she found out♨ she
instantly asked you on how to make it up to you, do something for you♨ you
insisted she didn’t need to, but she wanted it♨ you
then suggested for her to join you in a video♨ you
had an idea but needed help for it♨ Jaehee
happily agreed♨ that
is how the two of you found yourself in your kitchen at home, camera
said♨ you
were doing the cooking challenge♨ which
in itself wasn’t a thing, but you made it one, since you couldn’t
cook or bake for shit♨ everything
started out fine, almost like a cooking tutorial♨ Jaehee
and you had picked something simple to start with♨ if
people liked it, you’d suggested making it a series♨ the
pasta actually turned out pretty fine and you were surprised♨ you
ate it before continuing part two of the video and neither of you had
to throw up, so…♨ part
two is where it got really fun♨ Jaehee
wanted to teach you how to bake a cake♨ that
is very complicated though♨ it
started when you accidentally tripped and flour was spread all over
Jaehee, you and the kitchen♨ after
that everything just turned into a little war♨ by
the time you called it quits the video was extremely long, the cake
wasn’t happening and the two of you were covered in everything and
anything♨ “So,
if you want to learn how to destroy your kitchen in just a few easy
steps feel free to follow this tutorial!”♨ needless
to say that cooking challenge did turn into a seriesJumin♛ Jumin
isn’t good with technology, he never was♛ he’s
incapable of using an IPhone camera and took ages to uncover all of
the features of the RFA-app♛ he
didn’t even really know what YouTube was, let alone how to use it♛ he
had other things on his mind than silly little videos on the internet♛ that
was until he found out that apparently you were a professional
YouTuber♛ and
a very famous one at that♛ at
first he was confused and didn’t know whether to take it serious or
not♛ but
then you told him you could work from home and he was extremely
supportive♛ you
still had a job like you wanted, earned your own money like you
wanted but never had to leave the apartment without him which
meant you were safe and he didn’t have to worry – Perfect♛ that
is until you ask him to join you for a video♛ despite
being a public figure, talking like that seems uncomfortable♛ that
is until you explain what the boyfriend tag is and how it works♛ he
instantly relaxes, happy to parade your relationship for everyone to
see and here♛ the
two of you sat down together, started the camera and you began
reading questionsWhen
did we meet and where?”We
met in a special chatroom a couple of months ago”“It’s
much sweeter than it sounds, really!”Where
was our first kiss?“At
my apartment.”“Yeah,
in front of Sarah.”“You’re
still mad about that?”“Well,
it sure wasn’t romantic, Jumin.”Who
said “I love you” first?“Me,
although you realized it first, I think.”“You
were very emotionally constipated when we first met.”“You
still chose me though.”“You
were rich.”♛ when
he looked at you unimpressed you laughed and stole a quick kiss♛ the
blush that spread on his cheeks was very pleasant to look atWhen
did you meet my parents?“At
our wedding. They were very nice.”“Things
were very…quick, between the two of us…”What
is the one thing you wish I didn’t do?“Put
yourself in danger to help others all the time. I told you to be more
selfish.”“You
never let me forget, honey, but you know I’ll still continue doing
it.”Where
was our first date?“Is
you sleeping at my place considered a date?”“Jumin,
that sounds perverted!”“What?
How? We didn’t even sleep in the same bed for most of the time”“Jumin!”♛ he
was the one to end the video by pulling you in for a passionate kiss

anonymous asked:possibly tmi but i just wanted to thank you for mentioning diva cups a few times on your blog. i'd never even HEARD of them before because womens health is just never discussed or at least never discussed well. (and when i bought mine a few months ago there was exactly one of each size because they're not even marketed! ugh) seriously though, that thing is fucking life changing. thanks :)Hi there! That’s not TMI at all, don’t worry - I actually don’t know why we don’t discuss these things more openly. Like - I never remember anyone ever shaming me over this, and my mom was never secretive or anything, and yet I still grew up with this idea the subject was TABOO and I should never mention it to anyone and what the hell? Thankfully, a few years ago I entered into the ‘no fucks left to give’ phase of my life and I now consider the menstrual cycle a topic like any other. And the mooncup (or diva cup) changed my life so much I mostly mention it at random - like, I will bring it up if a friend is all pale and unhappy and won’t come to the swimming pool because *whispers* You know, and I even talked about it in the classroom once or twice - when you teach ancient languages, you often have more girls than boys, and there’s always that one lesson when you translate weird texts - stuff about ancient make-up, or how women are crazy because their uteri move inside their bodies. So, anyway - mooncups are awesome and everyone should give them a chance. Their magic powers of problem solving include -“Shit, I’m two days early and I’m in the middle of nowhere without tampons.” (I always have a spare in my purse, and I don’t miss those days where bleeding through your pants and tying a sweater over your bum were your only option).“Shit, it’s been seven days already and I’m out of tampons and I’m currently kayaking down the Nile, so I have no way to buy them.” (Lol.)“I’m staying at a friend’s/at my boyfriend’s/at my in-laws’ and I’m embarrassed about leaving behind dirty pads and tampons.” (Thing is, you should NOT be embarrassed - having a period is normal and a sign of a healthy body, so just dispose of your pads and tampons properly and don’t feel bad about it - but a mooncup solves this problem, since it’s simply washed and inserted again.)“I wish I could swim/hike/walk to the bus stop, but no pad or tampon will stop my mighty womanhood flow.” (I don’t care if you bleed 1L a minute - a mooncup will hold for at least one hour even with a heavy flow.)“Pads are uncomfortable and I feel like a nappy-wearing toddler and also it’s 40 degrees outside and I’m sweating like a she-ghoul even down there.” (Goodbye, pads. We’re thankful for your service.)“Tampons make my belly hurt.” (Apparently that’s a common problem, and as far as I know no one’s researched the cause - probably has to do with the fact men don’t have to deal with this. But - *gasps* - you’ll have no symptoms with mooncups. None.)“Tampons are dangerous and I might actually die.” (That’s true. But mooncups carry no health risk.)“Inserting a tampon makes me feel violated.” (If you’re 100% a virgin, internal thingies might not be for you, but it never hurts to try. Just put on some relaxing music, and pick a time where you can lock yourself in the bathroom for as long as you want. Mooncups are bit trickier to insert than an applicator tampon, but they’re not nearly as invasive - they sit much lower inside your vagina and fit so snugly you don’t even feel them.)“Taking out a tampon on light flow days makes me wish I was dead.” (Yeah, I remember that feeling. Good times. Not.)“I read a statistics about how women use up about 11K tampons in their lifetime and I wish there was a greener option.” (There is: mooncups.)“I spend about $60 a month for tampons and pads, that’s a lot.” (A mooncup costs approximately $30 and lasts for years.)Honestly - I’m glad you found my posts, anon, because this thing literally changed my life. I never had many period-related symptoms, but periods are annoying enough in themselves, especially if you’re active and like/need to move around. To me, a mooncup means forgetting about periods completely. You don’t feel it inside your body, you only need to change every few hours, or even daily, on a light flow, you can keep it in all night, and if you feel like it, you can even have pretty good sex (the non-penetrative kind) and neither you nor your partner will be inconvenienced at all. Girlfriends - this is a revolution, and my suggestion is - join it.

anonymous asked:sfw/nsfw headcanons for Genya?YES ABSOLUTELY. Genya’s route is by far my favorite in Tsuki so far (ok then again tbf I’ve only finished Sakuya and am halfway through Hanzo so…)Fujibayashi Genya headcanonsSFW- He’s a super light sleeper due to his upbringing, but he can fall asleep anywhere, anytime. Nothing to do? Nap time!- He often gets little rips in his clothes because Oboro likes to yank on them when he tries to defy her. He has asked her to stop. She doesn’t care, because she wouldn’t have to do it in the first place if he could at least pretend to be a responsible adult.- Is kind of a cheapskate and super conscious of money, but he doesn’t stiff on Oboro and you. He likes to call you the breadwinner, though.- Suffers from extreme temperatures. Hates both summer and winter. Oboro sleeps in his bed when it’s cold so that he stops waxing eloquent about how stiff and miserable he is.- Cheats at games all the time without a shred of guilt. You snooze, you lose!- Is okay at cooking but thinks it’s troublesome. Why does it take longer to cook than to eat? Ridiculous. Plus stoves are hot.- Kind of wants to wear nail polish, but maintenance is a pain.- Mixed feelings about his mother. Gives zero fucks about his father. Loves his baby brother so, so much.- Gets along very well with Shigezane. Avoids Kojuro as much as possible (not very much) because Kojuro always has a lecture ready for him. Doesn’t come into contact often with Masamune but kind of likes him, partially because he has caught Masamune talking to Oboro multiple times.  - Likes teasing you and watching you squirm. He always knows what you’re thinking, and he WILL use it to his advantage. Super playful in a lazy, laid-back sort of way.- Often gets all up in your face and makes you think he’s going to kiss you, but when you close your eyes, he tickles your nose or licks your cheek. You fume. He laughs and tells you to do something about it yourself if you’re so hot for it.NSFW under cut Keep reading

Sherlock’s attraction toward MollyI know, I know a lot of people will say that Sherlock was sexually attracted to Irene Adler but I think he did find Molly Hooper sexually attractive as well. I have proofs I want to share.If you look closely at this picture you’ll notice Molly is wearing lipstick in a subtle shade of red (I adjusted the brightness of the picture to make the lip colour more noticable.) Clearly, Sherlock noticed it.Now look at this gif. Sherlock’s saying “mouth’s too small now”. Too small for what? Why was Sherlock bothered by her small mouth? Why was he complaining about it? And nope, I do not think Sherlock was just being rude. He was disappointed she wiped it off.Let’s get back to the previous situation where Sherlock notices her lipstick. In his mind Sherlock obviously thought her lips looked bigger than before hence he uttered “mouth’s too small now”. And we all know big lips are a sign of sexiness and most guys are attracted to fuller lips. Molly’s red lips appeared fuller to Sherlock that’s why he thought it was a big improvement. Now I’m going to quote some lines from an article from DailyMail to make my suggestion more digestible.“Full lips were deemed to be the most attractive feature, but the appeal of thin lips increased by more than 40 per cent once make-up had been applied.Dr Geoff Beattie, who led the research, said: ‘This study proves that lips represent one of the most sensual aspects of a woman’s body and play a critical role in human sexual attraction. Full and red lips combined deliver the perfect pout to achieve male fixation, but women who simply wear lipstick – regardless of their lip type – secure significantly greater levels of attraction than those who do not.‘The research suggests that red lips and perceived attractiveness are still inextricably linked, with red lipstick proving to be the most powerful attractor and significantly increasing visual fixation.’ ”See my point? Molly’s red lips subtly but surely piqued Sherlock’s interest. That red mouth might have just sparked something in him. P.S - Irene also wore red lipstick when he first met her didn’t she?Ah! The very famous Christmas scene. Where Sherlock was literally ogling her. No seriously he was! He noticed her make up and clothes, lips and breasts to be very precise. He deduced that she was trying to seduce her date wearing the dress and makeup. You’d say he was just being Sherlock but I’d say he was being a pervert! [Sorry Sherlock I love you but you needed to know that]. Was noticing the size of her breasts, how cute right? Hell no!Again, he pointed out two things that men find most sexy, lips and breasts. Wasn’t he being too specific? And notice her lip colour, RED! He was distracted by her and so he blurted out in the middle of his work giving her his full attention, “I see you’ve got a new boyfriend, Molly and you’re serious about him…” Do tell me if I’m wrong!Now let’s look at this gif of Sherlock making innuendo to Molly and yes that’s an innuendo. Look at his reaction, look at Molly’s reaction to his words. She was feeling uneasy. Why would she feel uneasy if it was just a cough check he meant? Hm!Sure he was high on drugs but that doesn’t mean he didn’t know what he was saying. I mean come on, he said all the right stuff to John why would he mess up with Molly? Anyway, back to the innuendo part. I don’t think I have seen Sherlock included himself in any innuendo with someone else before. Heck, he never made an innuendo as far as I remember. He mostly avoided anything related to sex so why all of a sudden he’d joke about himself and Molly? I’d like to think he used to somewhat fantasise about Molly when he was really high. Therefore, I rest my case.Thanks to those wonderful people who make these amazing gifs. Also you can check out the article I was talking about down below. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1332709/amp/Men-drawn-womans-lips-facial-feature.html

I apologise for all the technical difficulties as of late ;-; as you can see, the ask didn’t even fully show up in my ask box either, but no matter! I’m pleased to write it for you Anon! Ray and Lance fluff coming right up! I did headcanons, I hope that’s alright, and I also decided I’d do domestic headcanons…which…I think would be super adorable~Lancelot~When he found out she was pregnant, the whole world seemed to stop moving. He cried, he was so happyTo think, he had been so dismal before he had met MC, then she fell down the rabbit hole and now…He was going to have a family. His OWN family. With her! Though, he still had his worries and anxieties… especially concerning the not yet born baby that was due in a little over 7 monthsHe was very soft about his worries though, not wanting to seem like he was hovering, but at the same time he appeared right at her side as soon as she even thought about needing a back rub, or help reaching a high shelf. He also really loved to talk to the child too, every night laying in bed, he sang lullabies that he remembered from when he was a child. You can expect that Jonah was equally, or even more excited than he was, he was going to be an UNCLE, or, at least an uncle figure. And he also helped decorate the nursery (MC’s old room, but repurposed and child proofed) with everything she could have possibly needed. Lancelot pitched in a lot with that, and even painted it himself…The last trimester was the roughest on him, he took time away from his duties whenever possible, instead spending as much time as he could with MC to make sure everything was going okay. Again, he was soft with it, and was careful to never be overbearing. He was very calm when she finally had gone into labor, and had escorted her down to the infirmary himself using his teleportationHe had no idea what was going on throughout the process, and had felt immense pain when MC squeezed the living daylights out of his hand, But the moment he held his child for the first time, he had been overcome by a brand new feeling. He was gentle with her, as if she would crumble apart in his arms if he wasn’t careful enough, stroking his fingers over her delicate forehead. She cooed up at him, and suddenly all of his emotions were set free.  MC was asleep on the hospital cot, getting a much needed nap, so he wouldn’t give her back now, but he had to sit down because his eyes were brimming with tears and he was afraid to drip on the baby. He absolutely would partway spoil his child. Because of her, he spends a little bit less time with his work, but when he does work, she’s always welcome to come and watch him.(there’s a picture of her right on his desk along with his wife) He loves her so much, he loves his wife so much. And yes of course she would become future king, because he would raise her to be resilient and strong, just like her mother. Oh!! I imagine his child’s name would be Scarlet. Scarlet Kingsley This girl is basically a princess now, and her father is her night in shining armor. he definitely teaches her through play how to be a good ruler, and she likes being the knight sometimes too… Lance doesn’t mind wearing the tiara, but he likes the way his wife looks In a crown better. Additionally, I bet he would take parenting tips from Sirius, and Sirius would be like ‘wtf I don’t know anything about that kind of stuff’ and then give flawless advice. And Harr would be the godfather~Ray~Somehow, Seth was the first to know the news. Even before Ray…He was just the first one to put two and two together, and he was also the most in touch with his feminine side so it was pretty much just common sense to himAnd yes, MC did tell him first, on one of their girls outings, but only because she wasn’t sure. The gasp he made was unheard ofWhen it came time to tell Ray, she had pulled him aside in their room and sat him down. “Ray, I’m…pregnant.”“Hi pregnant……….I’m dad” he croaked,  choking back tears. He renovated the nursery himself, Seth helped select colors, light powder blue, with white trimmings. (And a few sunflowers painted on the wall) Bet your bottom dollar this man read every parenting book in every library in cradle. Ray was gonna be the best damn father he could possibly be, he was  d e t e r m i n e d.One of Ray’s favorite things is to wrap his arms around MCs middle, watching day by day how the little one grew, and how she did, too.He tries his best to cater to her cravings, but unfortunately he’s not a very good chef.Luka opted out after he had to make pickles and peanut butter. (Poor boy just couldn’t handle it) But Luka was still super excited, he loves the idea of having a little kid around…Ray was a nervous wreck durring labor… He knew it wasn’t mortal danger, but the way you had yelled, (though admittedly, some of the things you said were funny) and the way the baby wailed once it was born…He was just…afraid to see either of them afraid or in pain ever again. When he holds the little baby girl in his arms he’s immediately baffled at how much she looks like him, from her nose, to her cheeks, to her soft hazel eyes, she was a copy of ray. He tries to name her Belle, after his cat, but compromises on the name… Winter. Winter Blackwell.He shows her off so much. Like, he goes to the market, and at every stall he’s like “LOOK AT THIS BABY MY WIFE MADE!” While mc facepalms and drags him to the next shop.  He’s like Hughes is with Elicia. (He’s got at least 700 pictures of his wife and his daughter on him in some way) And every night, while mc rocks the baby to sleep every night, he reads to her. (Partially because he wants her to love books like he does, but also because he read that it’s really good for babies.) Fenrir + Sirius babysitting is the best combination. Fenrir brings the fun, and Sirius brings the responsibility and extra diapers. Not to say that Sirius isn’t fun…winter loves his earrings… And also being carried by him since he’s so tall.

            ★        as soon as my dcbb posted i took a day to rest and then moved straight on to writing another fic, so i never really stopped to tell people about itHELLO FRIENDS AND STRANGERS, I POSTED A DESTIEL FIC★ The Wireless ★it’s a 58k AU set at a carnival, in a world all messed up by global warming, and free-range monsters. there’s a 1930s-esque solarpunk vibe (brass everything, renewable resources, dean in suspenders!! makeup is gender neutral so both dean and cas casually wear it, hallelujah)dean and cas meet at a kissing booth, and smooches ensue!! except dean doesn’t realise they already know each other indirectly: dean and sam are both fans of cas’ monster-hunting-themed radio station - although dean would deny he listens to ‘bedtime stories for little hunters’ - and cas has been reporting on their cases for years. (dean accidentally talked to god that one time. he does not speak of that)there’s character development (duh), tent sex (twice), a sea monster named something silly that will make you laugh… also cas secretly has BIG ASS GLOWING WINGS and chases a train on a bicycle just to tell dean he wants to join him on an epic quest… y’know, normal fic stuffbut also it contains my most favourite line i’ve ever written. this is cas speaking live on the radio, about dean:“Yes, I say perfect: I could not have asked for more. I would change nothing. Again, he made me vulnerable, and I cannot tell you how impressive it is that a naked man could remove his weapon and still weaken an angel so greatly, with only kindness and affection.“He taught me that this is how we have to win,” Castiel said, voice breaking. “We need to win with love. I cannot take the blade or the bullets from everyone’s hand. But I can rally forces with a single cry: throw down your weapon. Be kinder. Be softer. Ask your enemy what peace would look like for them. The only enemies we have to fight are the ones who answer with ‘you beneath my feet’.”one of my betas wasn’t especially fond of it. but i had a distinct purpose with this line: once you strip away the fiction and metaphor, i wanted it to be relevant to punching nazis and achieving political revolution and equality for everyone. it’s kind of the whole overarching theme of this story. and i just wanted to share that. this is hands-down the coolest story aesthetic-wise, and most morally-charged story i’ve written to date. if you’ve ever wanted a novel by me, here ya go.also it’s cute. and intimate. and all that good stuff.it would mean THE WORLD to me if you felt like settling down with a blanket and the beverage of your choice, and getting lost in this universe i made just for you. ♥also here’s my patreon in case you have money and want to throw it at me so i can write more stuff (pretty please!! it’s my only source of self-generated income because i’m too sick to function)okay, that’s all. sending love to you all~Elmie x

rosesilverpenrp  asked:[a different, goofy ask! What kind of hat do you think each of the marriage candidates would wear? I feel like Harvey would wear a boater hat, perhaps Sebastian would wear a beanie, that sort of thing? I was talking to a friend about Sebastian, who called Sebastian a "cute bean" and I got the picture  of emo nerd in a beanie, so I'd like to see what  you think other characters would wear as hats/head accessories! ~Rose-mun]Okay!!Alex: I love Alex but probably a SnapBack Sam: In all honesty I doubt a hat could fit on his head, but he might wrap a bandana around his forehead for that punk rock aesthetic.Elliot: a beret probably, i feel like he could pull it off though. Sebastian: I agree, a beanieHarvey:Caps mostly, but probably likes dapper stuff too.Shane: I feel like Shane would wear a dad cap.Abigail: Either the ribbon she canonically wears Harvey a solid black headband with lace on it.Haley: Idk if this counts but I could see her wearing a scrunchie or a sunhat.Leah: I doubt she’s wear one? maybe the occasional ribbonPenny: I could see her wearing a lot of headbands to keep her hair out of her face while she reads.Maru: I could see Maru wearing a lot of colorful hair clips, or just ponytail holders.Emily: Anything and everything, but she’s probably drawn to stuff with feathers

anonymous asked:Imperial Problem Child-verse. "Hey, Mom. This is going to be a weird question, but do you know which doctor Mrs. Lars took Luke to? He's having a... weird reaction to a painkiller. I'll let you know what I can in my next letter. Love, Janek." Tank glanced at Wedge. "You sure he never did this in the Rebellion?" "I think I'd remember Luke claiming to be the ruler of sand while somehow perched on a light fixture." "True. I'm not telling his dad, though." "That's fair. Make the doc do it?"Tank paced the medbay with a strange expression on his face. The fact that they were in the same general coordinates as Tatooine was probably the only reason he was able to reach his parents’ frequency at all, but even so the connection was of poor quality, and audio only. Luke watched him in a kind of hazy amusement, not really aware of what was going on.“No, no Mom, it wasn’t vitameatavegamin. That’s not even a real thing. No, it’s not, I swear it’s not.”He paused, listening for a moment, squinting as though this would make him hear better. “Fixer’s mom told you? Well there’s the problem. Mrs. Loneozner also thinks that pit droids carry disease. Not a reliable source.”Tank looked over at Wedge apologetically, who had a supremely amused expression on his face even as he gently tugged Luke down from where he was making an industrious attempt to climb up a medical cabinet, muttering about good vantage points for sniping.“Luke, buddy,” Wedge said gently, “Nobody in their right mind is gonna give you a gun for the next three weeks at least. Don’t worry about sniping.”“Yeah, but if the guys come in-” Luke muttered, his mind clearly on a track he hadn’t informed his friends of.“I’ll handle it, okay? But I don’t need to sit on a cabinet to do it. Just trust me and sit down a minute,” Wedge pleaded.A triumphant sound caused the two to look up to where Tank flashed a thumbs-up. “Thanks Mom, you’re a lifesaver, literally. I’ll talk to you next time I get leave, love you!”He cut off the comm and shook his head. “I never thought I’d say this, but thank the Force that my dad is a pack-rat. He still had old emergency contact forms for when we all went to agro-school between harvests. The Darklighters, Sunbers, and Lars were all kind of backups for each other. Man, I’d forgotten some of this stuff.”He patted Luke’s shoulder as he passed him and leaned over the table where the doctor was trying to figure out which medication had caused the reaction. “It’s the provotin cystate,” he supplied. “Luke reacts to it the way you might to coming out of anesthesia post-op. Only for the first twenty minutes or so. Once that runs out, my mother remembered that he mostly experienced stiff joints and a headache until it wears off.”The doctor scribbled that down in his datapad as if it were a matter of life or death.Actually, given just who the patient was, it probably was a matter of life or death.

finnyoakstar  asked:Hello frend~☆ So I've been out of the MM fandom for some time now. I was more or less forced out due to treatment from fans and groups on FB which caused me to utterly hate all things MM. I even stopped cosplaying though I felt great as Zen and Vandy...but your blog always reminds me of the good times and the small beginnings of MM where people just had fun loving the characters. So thank you for that. If I could, I'd like to request some sort of angst/comfort with Vandy. I still love him. 💖
✿ Oh no, I’m so sorry to hear that! I love your cosplay, and you made a really heckin’ cute Vanderwood! (Like, if I’m being real here, when you followed me I clutched at my heart and was like, “oh my god… this incredibly cute and talented person… likes my stuff??? what is this!”)Anyway. You got me in a prose mood, so let’s give it a go.He was by the water, curled up with a fine mist settled over his messy brown hair. You could see the light gleaming in it, and you could see a rainbow shimmer glistening on the spray of water beyond, sparkling in the sunlight above the tumultuous churn of the waterfall. You scooted closer to him, the fabric of your pants wet due to the damp grass and dirt. It wasn’t something you minded, really, though it was a bit unpleasant. The mud, the sweat, the lingering scratches from the branches that had whipped against your face while you’d been running… they all bothered you, but it was nothing compared to what the man beside you was enduring.You reached out, placing your hand lightly on Vanderwood’s shoulder. He didn’t respond to your touch, which was about the best you could hope for, really. At least he didn’t flinch away.“How are you doing? Seven should be back soon with something to eat, and maybe he’ll manage to get some cell-service to call Jumin. You’ll be okay. I promise you, you’ll be okay.”Vanderwood groaned softly, tilting his head and peering up you hovering over him. With the movement, you could see the blood-soaked bandage peeking underneath the coat he’d wrapped around himself like a security blanket. You desperately wanted to change it, but you had nothing to change it with. All you had left was the shirt you were wearing, and that was far too dirty to press against an open gunshot wound.You bit your lip, but you managed to smile. For his sake, you could do anything. “You’ll be okay. Jumin will come save us. We told him we were going to Mint Eye. He’ll be looking.”`Vanderwood squeezed his eyes shut, shaking his head mutely. You wanted him to look at you, to… talk to you, but he was in pain, so you didn’t want to push him. You felt like you had so much to say to him, though. So much to tell him.But you’d bottle that all up until he got better, because he would get better.“You should leave me,” he spoke, his voice a paper-thin rasp. Once more, he opened his eyes, but this time he looked towards the water, watching the ripples and the droplets dancing in the sunshine. “This is a nice place to die, and I’m slowing you down. They’re still looking for us, you need to run - ““No!” You interrupted with a sharp, firm voice. Your other hand tightened on your knee; you didn’t want to put any undue pressure on him by grabbing onto Vanderwood’s shoulder. “No. Absolutely not. I refuse. After everything? There’s no way either of us is leaving you behind!”“You’re stupid,” he grumbled, then said it a few more times underneath his breath. “I’m a dead man. A stupid, weak, dead man, and I don’t want my last fucking act to involve dragging you down, too.”You gritted your teeth, wanting to smack this idiot but knowing that you ought to restrain yourself until he was better. (Because he was going to get better. He was going to get better.) “Just… hold on, okay? Just don’t give up, and everything will be fine.”“…Why do you think that?”Vanderwood looked up at you, eyes surprisingly lucid despite the painted sweat dripping down his cheek, and asked you this once more. “Why do you think that? Why do you think anything could ever be fine?”He didn’t let you interrupt, managing to summon enough inner strength to  continue. “Everything’s always been shit. For me, for Seven - him, he might actually get a chance to be happy. He has people who care about him, people who are willing to help him, hell, he has you, who’s willing to go to the ends of the earth to save him. But me? What do I do, even if I survive this? The Agency was my world, you moron, and I…”“I betrayed them.” Vanderwood closed his eyes again, slumping his tensed shoulders and letting out a hiss of pain. “I betrayed them, and even if I live through this, I’m going to pay the price for it.”“Stop that!” You spat, and then you grabbed his hand, because screw it, you’re not just going to quietly wither in your feelings while the person you like his having a pity party. “You can have a world beyond them! The RFA loves you, Seven loves you, hell, even I - no, especially I - love you, so get that… defeatist, cynical attitude out of here, because I’m going to carry you out of these woods even if I have to bite someone.”There was a stunned pause, where all the both of you heard was the rumbling water. Then, “Even if I have to bite a lot of someones. Okay? So don’t… don’t…”And there it was, the water seeping out of your eyes, falling on his jacket like drops of water from the lake. “So don’t die, please…”Vanderwood didn’t know what to say. He looked at you, haloed by sunlight and the shadows of the trees above, and he felt your hand, fingers warm and clasped tightly around his own. And though it hurt - and though he was bleeding - he squeezed it tightly and remained quiet. Because - if you had your way - you’d both have all the time in the world to say what you wanted.And all he could really do is shut up and hope.

anonymous asked:do you have any thoughts on how to deal with gender with one's children? Like I wouldn't want to impose anything on then but at the same time I'm aware that you can't just opt out of a coercive system so I'd h ave to address it somehow? Thanks
probably the answer is just communicate openly and be someone they’re 
comfortable talking to but like everything about parenting it scares me 
(but I’m all broody lately fsr). Anyway it’s 2018 where I am so hello 
from the future I don’t think the “stuff” of gender is pronouns and clothing, I think the “stuff” of gender is gendered socialization and the socialization into harmful sex/gender roles, and that’s what I intend to try to avoid. I don’t think attempts to dress children in all neutral clothing and use they pronouns for them until the child picks a pronoun make much sense- it’s just encouraging the child to pick a role, and if they child picks a gendered pronoun it seems to me that it’s likely because they have picked a set of stereotypes to enact, which seems pretty counterproductive to me. The benefits seem minor and the potential loss of the entire ability of the child to be socially legible when prepubescents are already androgynous seems like a major drawback to me. For this reason “gender neutral parenting” that involves sort of acting like socialization doesn’t exist seems counterproductive. Girls need to be actively supported in deviating from female gender roles, same for boys, etc- this pretense that children exist pregender is silly. Those roles exist, and I think as parents interested in not pigeonholing kids into them it makes sense to see this as an active fight, not “well let’s let our child pick their stereotypes on their own.”My goal as I think of it right now, and this could change by the time I have kids, is not to worry about whether my child will continue to identify with their assigned gender- my goal is to make sure that I am not PERSONALLY assigning them a gender, as in a set of gender roles, at all. This is not contradicted by using she or he for children because, again, I don’t think the “stuff” of gender lies in pronouns and clothing. My goal is, no matter what the sex of my children, they don’t feel like they aren’t able to wear pants or dresses or like music or science, etc. My goal is to ensure that I’m not raising a child to fit a gender role, and to be sure that, should I have girls, they are aware that they can behave however they’d like and have whatever interests they’d like, and that, should I have boys, they are aware that there are no expectations within the home of them behaving a certain way.But gendered socialization also happens outside the home and is enacted not just by teachers but by peers, and I think actively working to combat that as much as possible by talking about being gender nonconforming, should you end up with gender nonconforming kids, is important and valuable- kids aren’t stupid, and if your son is getting picked on because he likes painting his nails he should be able to talk to you about it without shame. I think BEING a gender nonconforming parent should be a big help here but generally I think kids feeling supported and NOT feeling pressured into performing a particular role is a good thing.

Sweet KissesA/n: This is my first Steve Harrington x reader fic so its not that great. I’ve read a ton on here but haven’t seen a lot of Steve with a chubby or curvy reader so I thought I’d write one. It’s super fluffy! I hope you all like it! I was also inspired by @hairringtonsteve while writing this!  Go check out their stuff they’re such an amazing writer also give them a follow their blog in general is amazing!Getting out of your car you grabbed your book bag and closed the car door heading into the entrance of the school, barely, passing by Billy and the group of girls that hang around him. You’re just about to pass him when he looks at you and says to the girls, “Didn’t know they let animals in school now.” Followed by a pig squeal. The girls laughed and that made you rush inside the school feeling beyond embarrassed.          You weren’t too heavy just chubby, and even though your weight didn’t bother you, you couldn’t help letting some people at school get to you. Rushing to your locker you grabbed your book for first period not noticing Jonathan, Nancy, and Steve heading your way until you felt a pair of arms wrap around you. “Hey, beautiful” Steve grinned as he gave you a kiss on your cheek. “Wanna go see a movie after school? It’ll be a double date with Jonathan and Nancy.”       When you turned around to face him and then looked at Nancy and Jonathan. You nodded giving them a bright smile. “Sounds fun, I’d love to!” You turned slightly to close your locker when you saw Jonathan looking into his bag and taking out a photo.  “I forgot to give these to you two, it’s from the dance last week.” He smiled handing you and Steve the pictures he took of you two standing in front of a dark blue background. You in your baby blue short sleeve dress that went just above your knees standing next to Steve in his grey and white suit. You thanked Jonathan and said bye to the boys when the bell rang for first period.         You and Nancy had science together so you two walked to class and when Nancy was sure the guys were out of earshot she turned to you and asked “Hey (y/n) are you okay? I saw what happened in the parking lot. You know you can tell me if anything’s bothering you.” You shook your head. “Nothings wrong I’m okay, really.” Nancy gave you a worried look but nodded understanding you probably didn’t want to talk about it.      After school, you headed home to get ready for your double date. You looked through your closet and found an outfit you thought looked nice to wear. Looking in the mirror you noticed your shirt was a bit tight in your stomach area. At first, it didn’t bother you but the more you looked at yourself the more you hated how you looked. The things some of the students at the school said about you started creeping into your mind again. It didn’t help that you remembered what Billy had said that morning.        It was that moment you realized you were crying, you quickly grabbed a tissue from your nightstand and wiped your eyes. You checked your face in your mirror to see if you could tell if your eyes were red or puffy, luckily they weren’t. After a couple of minutes of doing your makeup, your mom called you from the living room shouting that Steve was here to pick you up. You grabbed your bag making your way downstairs and gave your mom a goodbye hug.    Steve said goodbye to your mom and lead you out to his car, “You look amazing as ever baby.” You didn’t have to look at him to know he was giving you a genuine smile, but you gave him a small “Thanks.” and opened the car door to get in. At this Steve sensed something was upsetting you and rushed to the other side and got in immediately looking worried.       “Hey princess, are you okay? What’s wrong?” You sighed and gave a small smile, “It’s nothing Steve. I’m alright. It’s just something small it’ll pass don’t worry.” Steve took your hand in his,  “(y/n), whatever it is you can tell me no matter how small the issue is, I want to hear it and help you.” You looked away from his worried eyes and gently bite your lower lip. “Steve….can….can we talk before we go?” He let out a shaky sigh and started the car. He drove to a vacant place where you two could talk and be alone.        Turning off the engine he looked at you nervous as hell. You sighed and turned to look at him feeling guilty when you saw how anxious he was. “Steve….why did you ask me out?” Steve was taken aback by your words but quickly recovered and answered your question. “I asked you out because I liked you and I thought you were the most beautiful girl I’ve ever seen.” Your lip quivered but you pushed back the tears that were threatening to leave your eyes. “But why me Steve? You could have anyone else but you chose me the chubby girl that everyone makes fun of. I don’t even deserve someone as amazing and good looking like you! I have to look like some pig next to a god like you!“      By now tears were pouring out and they wouldn’t stop even if you tried to hold them back. Steve immediately pulled you into a tight yet gentle hug, “(y/n)….baby don’t ever say that. I love everything about you, and I mean everything all your curves, squishy cheeks and not just the ones on your face.” Steve smirked knowing that made you blush. “You’re smart, funny, kind, and beyond gorgeous. You’re not a pig, you’re my goddess and I’m the one that doesn’t deserve someone like you.”      He gently cupped your face and wiped your tears away with his thumbs. “You’re the love of my life. I swear to god I’m going to kick Billy’s ass the next time I see him he has no right to call my princess a pig.” You pulled away looking at him shocked that he knew about that. Steve kissed your forehead and smiled down at you. “Nancy told me. She was worried about you and she told me what happened in the parking lot. I wanted to beat the shit out of Billy then and there but I also was really worried about you and how you were doing.”       You gave him a genuine smile and gave him a quick but sweet kiss. “I’m such an idiot for believing them…. I love you so much, Steve Harrington.” He grinned and kissed you one more time. “I love you too (y/f/n) (y/l/n).” Getting back into you’re original positions in your seats, Steve started the car and you two drove away to meet up with Jonathan and Nancy at the movies. He was holding your hand and rubbing small circles with his thumb. Both of you smiling and feeling so much more in love.

mad-eyeoody  asked:First off I'd like to thank you guys! You got me into podcasts in the first place and they're such a big part of my life now.   My question is: how do you guys get into character before recording?Generally, in advance while reading the scripts, I write a pretty thorough autobiography. I’ve really only had to do this twice for “The Bright Sessions” - once at the very beginning and then again when we met Wadsworth because I had to create a history for our relationship. Then, on the way to recording, I listen to the mix-tape Joan made for Mark (which is just a bunch of my fave songs). Then I try to meditate in my parked car to help me clear my head of Julia’s life stuff and be ready to be open to receive whatever my cast-mate(s) throw me. And at recording, right before we start, I’ll start talking and connecting with the other actor ASAP. That’s generally pretty easy now since I’m close w/ everyone and we’ve established our characters’ relationships pretty well by this point. - JuliaI actually love Briggon so it’s pretty easy. Just before we begin recording, we usually have some time to hang so we’ll catch up, hang out, and get comfortable so the performance tends to flow naturally.  When it gets more emotional, I try to put myself in the moment of the dialog and feel it and it just comes out. - Alex G.Sam and I are so similar that I never have to travel very far to get in her headspace. For me, it’s all about the breathing - she speaks a little higher and speedier than I do so I focus on breathing a bit more quickly and shallowly. - LaurenI just show up. No seriously, I live in the truth of who this person is and what is his wants/needs in life. -PhillipCaleb and I are pretty similar, actually. BUT…sometimes…honestly…and this may seem silly…but I’ll wear a hat to record…thinking that turns me into a high school kid. Like: Baseball Cap = High School Jock. Character prep DONE. As for Caleb’s relationship with Adam…I very genuinely love and care about Alex…so really just hanging with him in front of a mic is all I need to connect with that magnificent boy. - Briggon
For me, the minutes leading up to recording is more about getting comfortable. If I’m relaxed, I can be more spontaneous during the performance. Overall, it’s just about remembering what my character wants and the rest takes care of itself. ~Charlie
I press “record” and then sit there really quietly. -Mischa
