    Summary
      Harry Potter grew up knowing no love. Beatings were given to him daily, along with the long list of chores that no child should have to do alone.Harry Potter never went to Hogwarts when his first year came around. Nor did he go when is was supposed to be his second or third. Only when he is fourteen, someone comes for him.But Harry Potter was never the Boy-Who Lived in the first place.He was only the brother.
