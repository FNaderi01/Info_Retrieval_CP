    Summary
      The road ever goes on, no matter how bitter the tears have become, or how hurting you may be. Bilbo brought many things back to his hole under the hill. From the last of the Durin’s sons, to a trinket so evil and wicked it spoiled all that it touched.

    Summary
      When Gimli wakes up in the past, he knows he must do nothing to endanger the future. If Frodo's quest danced upon the edge of a knife, anything he does to change the world around him could mean doom for all Middle-earth. As inevitable change comes, he begins to lose his memories of the future that was, the new future becoming uncertain. For he is bound in ways he never was before, even as a familiar quest begins to take form.

    Summary
      It had started as a normal day for nine friends, up until they found themselves scattered across Middle-Earth. Why are they here? For what purpose? And most importantly, how did they get here?They, and the Company of Thorin Oakenshield, must quickly adapt, however, for these nine are here for a reason. Darkness is coming, and the dragon must be dealt with. Can certain things be prevented? It seems their only choice is to go along with the quest, at least until someone can explain why these things have happened.Just a tale of what might happen if nine, seemingly normal friends from Earth, were suddenly thrust into the fictional world of Middle-Earth, and what their decisions might change in the whole scheme of things.

    Summary
      Bard can't stop looking at the Elvenking. Thranduil can't stop looking at the Bowman. After the battle, Thranduil is exhausted and vulnerable and Bard is feeling overwhelmed, and they find themselves leaning on each other for support. Everything moves very quickly after that.Updated daily - I am writing about 15 chapters ahead so there is plenty more to come!

    Summary
      Bilbo Baggins of Bag End was not a very respectable Hobbit. No respectable Hobbit had a sword and crossbow hanging in their home, nor did they have Dwarves as family. But Bilbo Baggins did, and all of Shire knew of his husband, blacksmith Thorin Oakenshield.When Bilbo comes home to find his Husband earlier than expected, he learns of a quest to reclaim Erebor. It is a death mission. Bilbo knows that Dwarves are stubborn creatures, and none more than Thorin himself. But nobody said that Bilbo himself was any less stubborn.So he will follow his dearest husband across all of Middle Earth, through plains and mountains and forests, all while hiding the true nature of their relationship (Dwarven politics never helped anyone), brushing off some old wounds (and getting new ones) and finding out new things about the dwarf Bilbo calls husband (and his extended family).Nobody ever said love was easy, after all.

    Summary
      Many of Fíli’s earliest memories are of his Uncle Thor’s forge in Bree.  No matter where his life would eventually take him, Fíli would always think of that forge with fondness and longing, because apparently when one associates with wizards, one's life has a habit of becoming something unrecognisable from what it was before.Bilba Baggins has no intention of going Moria. No one will be there waiting for her anyway and the entire arranged marriage is a complete farce. It's a shame that neither Gandalf or her grandfather are in agreement.

    Summary
      In a perfect, controlled picture of grace, a long white figure emerges from the car, wrapped in silk trimmed with snow-white fur despite the stifling heat, his famous unfashionably long white-blonde hair softly draped over one shoulder under a snug-fitting cloche hat, his lean, supple waist emphasized by the long, drop-waisted line of the coat, his face a picture of pale perfection, with the barest hint of paint to enhance his gorgeous, dramatic features. This is Thranduil Lasgalen, possibly the biggest star in the movies in the year 1925, male omega, worshipped by the public the world over.

    Summary
      What if orcs had taken over Erebor before the company had ever set out? What if Frerin hadn't died at the Battle of Azanulbizar, but was taken as a slave by those orcs?In a world divergent from what Bilba feels it should be, Hobbits have magic. Magic strong enough for orcs to have taken her captive as a child back to Erebor in order to serve them as a slave. There, she is subject to a miserable life under the authority of the orcs, living silently and never drawing attention to herself. But when roars begin to echo throughout the mountain and rumors are heard of a plan to march on the elven fortress of Mirkwood and the rest of Arda, silence is no longer an option.And with the rest of Middle Earth completely oblivious to the army of orcs occupying Erebor, the ripples of the darkness are poised to spread farther than ever before.

    Summary
      What would it take for Thorin to survive the Battle of Five Armies? What could happen after if he did? A close look at the unique connection between two halves of a whole: Bilbo and Thorin. A love story told through mentions of possible universes, references to the quest for Erebor, dreams, and post-BoTFA situations that may or may not challenge their soul bond.
OR:
After Bilbo and Thorin go through a series of trials seemingly meant to keep them apart forever, Thorin wakes up to find out that the Arkenstone is now in the hands of King Thranduil, who wants to use its powers to bring his wife back to life and who is overseeing the recovery of Thorin’s nephews. There appears to be no end in sight for more harsh testing of Bilbo and Thorin’s love. In fact, this is just the beginning.
