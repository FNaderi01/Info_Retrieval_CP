                                                            This is the one who sucks at social media again; Thank you!! I saw the Whumptober prompts today on AO3 and I always love reading them but never knew where people were getting all of the prompts from. After taking the initiative today, I found your page and immediately started to brainstorm with all of the prompts. I actually just picked up writing again and If its okay I would post it on AO3. üòä
                                                        Wohoo! That‚Äôs amazing. We‚Äôre happy to read this &lt;3 and are elated that our prompts inspired you enough to get back into writing. Please feel free to add your works to our ao3 collection :)

                                                            hello! i didn't see a question like this having been answered (apologies if it is‚Äî) but on ao3, will the collection/archive remain open even a few days after october ends, or the moment it's November will it close? I'm trying to be a completionist (for myself mainly) and i want to know if I need to write a bit quicker now that I'm one day behind.
                                                        It‚Äôll stay open even after the end October :)

As we explained previously, the archive is random and not a complete list of every work produced for the eventWe are not affiliated with the whumptober-2020 blog that has popped up. While we totally support side competitions, using the same name as our event is not appreciated and we will not be reblogging content produced for this parallel event.¬†We‚Äôre going to start tagging all archived posts with¬†‚Äúarchive‚Äù if you would like to continue following the blog but don‚Äôt necessarily want to see all the archived posts on your dash. To avoid confusion with the other event, we recommend using the tag #whumptober2020 without the space.Please read the FAQs before sending us an ask, especially now that the event is running and we‚Äôre swamped.All the 2020 Event Info that was pinned to the top of the page is now under the cut below so you don‚Äôt have to scroll past that big ol post when you visit.You can also visit our nifty little official Event Info page!Happy Whumping!Keep reading

                                                            Hi, thanks for running this event, looking forward to all the whump! Was wondering: I get that it won't count for completionist or anything, but can we still add our fic to the AO3 collection, if, for example, we finish something for a prompt in November, or at any other time after the event is over?
                                                        Yes :)

                                                            I'll post my fills in one work, but I'm a really slow writer and I know I won't finish in October. Can I keep the work on the AO3 collection or any fill written after October can't be there?
                                                        The AO3 collection is open and unmoderated. You can add to it all year round if that‚Äôs what you want. Good luck!

                                                        Yes, you add it yourself. When you‚Äôre posting you‚Äôll see this section:Use whumptober2020
