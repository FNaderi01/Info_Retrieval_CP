Rams Rout Colts in Home Opener            
				By Amanda Scurlock, sports writer                
	                	                Published September 14, 2017
		Defensive tackle Tanzel Smart (92)tackles Colts quarterback Scott Tolzien (16) (Robert Torrence/L.A. Sentinel).
To kick off their second season back in Los Angeles, the Rams secured a resounding 46-9 victory over the Indianapolis Colts at the Memorial Coliseum. The win showcased the energy and intensity of the Los Angeles defense and the passing game of quarterback Jared Goff.
“Big ups to Wade Philips right there, defensive genius and then with the play makers we got, it just makes everything easier,” said rookie corner Dominique Hatfield. “The front seven is amazing. It’s just good to look up to these guys.”
Goff made 21 passes for 306 yards and scored one touchdown, while running back Todd Gurley made 19 carries for 40 yards and one touchdown. Rookie wide receiver Cooper Kupp led the team in receptions with four catches for 76 yards. Defensive tackle Michael Brokers made three tackles.

Quarterback Scott Tolzien executed nine passes for 128 yards and running back Frank Gore had 10 carries for 42 yards. Wide receiver T.Y. Hilton got three receptions for 57 yards. Matthias Farley made eight tackles for the Colts.
Los Angeles set the tone in the early minutes, scoring a field goal from specialist Greg Zuerlein and a pick-six from cornerback Trumaine Johnson for 39 yards.
Quarterback Jared Goff (16) and center John Sullivan (65) at the line of scrimmage (Robert Torrence/L.A. Sentinel).
“Scoring on defense is big. We put emphasis on that all week. We had a couple pick sixes, a couple turnovers. It was good. It was good for our defense,” said Johnson.
When the Indianapolis offense reached a first and goal, Brockers and Johnson aggressively protected the end zone. A field goal kick put the Colts on the scoreboard, but the Rams defense reduced the Colts to 74 total yards in the first period.
Indianapolis only made two first downs in the second quarter. Their defense could not stop Goff’s passes. Gurley would score a five-yard touchdown rushing and Kupp made a 18-yard touchdown reception in their next possession.
“There should be playmakers on the outside and there was today,” Goff said. “I’m very proud of those guys and the way they played – continued to get open and continued to run good routes and be friendly and catch everything.”
In the last minute of the second quarter, Zuerlein scored another field goal and Los Angeles was ahead 27-3 by halftime.
Rookies like safety John Johnson (43) earned playing time during the Rams season opener (Robert Torrence/L.A. Sentinel).
The Rams’ second defensive touchdown came in the third quarter when safety Lamarcus Joyner intercepted one of Tolzien’s passes. Indianapolis scored their first touchdown in the fourth quarter by running back Marlon Mack.
“[I] can’t say enough about the defensive effort as a whole,” said Rams head coach Sean McVay. “I thought they were consistently putting pressure on Tolzien all day and really loved the way those guys fly around. It was fun to watch.”
In their next possession, Mack fumbled at the Colt’s seven-yard line. Although quarterback Jacoby Brissett recovered the ball, he was tackled by defensive end Morgan Fox, earning the Rams a safety on the play.
On September 17, the Rams will host the Washington Redskins at 1:25 P.M. in the L.A. Coliseum.
