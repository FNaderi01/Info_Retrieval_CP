    No Archive Warnings ApplyCaar Damask &amp; Hego DamaskCaar Damask Hego Damask | Darth PlagueisFather-Son Relationship Kid Fic silliness Fluff Caar is not a particularly competent parent little Hego is slightly mischievous but yet fairly well intentioned slightly too late for pileofsith's contest Sith family Sith cooking Cooking Sith Recipe translation metric vs. imperial (measurements) probably not wholly canon compliant Hego Damask is a weave structures geek even at this age cuteness I have no idea where this came from
    Summary
      By various appearances, it would seem that Caar Damask's small son is up to no good. Why else would he be in the kitchen, quiet, with a funny smell wafting from the oven?

    Summary
      Darthenshmirtz, as a young inventor and retailer of bratwurst, accidentally turns Plagueis into a child, which does not rank highly on Sideous's list of impressive feats. Indeed, it annoys him so greatly that it's a very good way to be permanently reduced in rank...
