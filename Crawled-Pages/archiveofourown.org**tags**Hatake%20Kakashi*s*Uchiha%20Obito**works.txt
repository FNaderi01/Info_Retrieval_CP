    Summary
      Obito only has one goal, to graduate and leave the god forsaken town for good. All those faces, the judgmental eyes, the laughter, the ridicule, years of pretending they don’t affect him, he’s absolutely sick of it all. He wants nothing more than to leave that miserable place controlling his every will. That is until he meets Kakashi, a boy whose world is more than meets the eye.

    Summary
      I've seen some collections of soulmate prompt fills and have always wanted to do some of my own. 
Each chapter will be a different pairing and a different soulmate au.
Edit: How it works! An explanation here, for any new comers. This collection is run entirely on prompts from my readers, I do not choose the pairings myself. When prompts open I allow a twelve hour window for anyone interested to throw their idea in to the pot. After the twelve hours are up I use a random number generator to select ten different prompts to fill. After I have filled all ten prompts I open another round. Rinse and repeat! Check the end notes of the most recent chapter to see how many chapters are left in the current round! 
Here is a link to the pairings that I write for and the characters that I do not accept prompts for.

      “You’re getting fat,” Kakashi tells him. “In your old age.”“Kid,” Pakkun says. “You’re the one that’s aging me. Here you are, summoning me at sunrise. In my twilight years, I need all the rest I can get, but do you let me have it? No, you wake me up and—” “It’s Itachi,” Kakashi interrupts. Pakkun goes still. “He was in Konoha last night.”Pakkun blinks. “Why?”“I don’t know. I didn’t realize who it was till I called you. I didn’t recognize his chakra.”or: Six months later, Kakashi finds out the truth about the Uchiha massacre. Things go differently.
