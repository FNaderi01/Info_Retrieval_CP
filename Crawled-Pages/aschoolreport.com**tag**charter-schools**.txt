									California charter school regulations pass Senate Education Committee after marathon session and intervention by Gov. Newsom
										After a seven-hour hearing and in a room inundated with advocates in color-coordinated T-shirts, the California Senate Education Committee narrowly passed two bills this week that will more strictly regulate charters, including giving local districts greater leeway to deny charter applications. The sharply contested bills split the committee 4-3, with state Sen. Steve Glazer, a...

									Commentary: When success is not enough — charter schools delivering better outcomes for low-income students still target of progressive ire
										“Video games are bad for you; they’re distracting,” says one kid. “They’re too violent,” says another. It’s jarring to hear middle-schoolers talk down on-screen entertainment, but the boys in this Bay Area classroom are doing their level best — and in Spanish, no less. To be sure, they’re practicing taking positions and marshaling evidence as part...

									Lawmakers are trying to end a weird quirk of California’s charter school sector. Here’s why the state is so unusual
										California legislators are considering a change to education law that would address a peculiar and controversial feature of the state’s charter school sector. The proposed fix is dredging up long-standing issues around how the state permits and oversees schools of choice.

									Research shows that charter schools do best for California’s low-income and minority students. Now state officials are considering slowing their expansion
										Updated California’s years-long debate over school choice has taken a decisive turn over the first few months of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s tenure — and the shift has come at the expense of charter schools. In February, Newsom convened a panel of experts to investigate whether charters siphon funding from school districts. The next month, he...

									Do charter schools have a leg up on teacher diversity? What a prominent new study out of North Carolina reveals about charters employing a more diverse mix of educators
										This article is from The 74’s ongoing ‘Big Picture’ series, bringing American education into sharper focus through new research and data. Go Deeper: See the full series. Over the past few years, education researchers have coalesced around a striking, if somewhat unpalatable, observation: Kids learn more from teachers of their own race. A decade of studies from...

									A student’s plea: California lawmakers need to listen to kids like me. Traditional schools give up on us. Charter schools don’t.
										California lawmakers have spent the past several weeks debating laws that would seriously hurt charter schools. While two of the bills have been shelved, others are moving forward that would be disastrous for students like me. What makes this situation especially disturbing is that voices like mine have not been heard. I’m a public high...

									Two of the strongest anti-charter bills fail in the California legislature, but two others move ahead as both sides claim victory

The demise of Assembly...

										The biggest statewide battle over charter schools in the country is coming to a head in California. Amid competing protests in Sacramento on Wednesday, the California Assembly narrowly passed legislation that would give local school districts sole authority to approve new charter schools.

									Robin Lake: Assessing charter schools’ impact on districts is too important to get wrong
										Several months ago I critiqued a report by Dr. Gordon Lafer that was published by In the Public Interest (ITPI), a think tank that has long been critical of charter schools and recently helped rally supporters of a five-year moratorium on new charters. Unfortunately, the report continues to inform policy deliberations in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom has tasked a commission to...
