    Graphic Depictions Of ViolenceHatake Kakashi/Uchiha Obito Hatake Kakashi &amp; Nohara Rin &amp; Uchiha ObitoUchiha Obito Hatake Kakashi Nohara Rin Namikaze Minato Uzumaki Kushina Shimura DanzouTime Travel or the results thereof Hatake Kakashi is a Troll Obito is overprotective So is Kakashi And Rin basically they try to out protect each other and the helicopter mom of the year award goes to- Carnivorous Plants (i did not see them coming) (but mokuton so) Mokuton Obit does some soul searching brief panic attack Character Death (but I don't think anyone will cry) Teamwork
    Summary
      Obito knows bone deep that he will never quite be the same again after living captive under the influence of Uchiha Madara, can feel the change under his skin were green things writhe. Kakashi's differences extend past his new found sense of humor, live in the complete disregard for others opinions. The change in Rin is subtler, something brewing under her quiet composure that he can't quite see the shape of yet.
