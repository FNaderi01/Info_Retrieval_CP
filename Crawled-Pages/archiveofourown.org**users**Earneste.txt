    Summary
      The girl’s montrals and lekku are dim with long-term grief and stress. Gently, he stretches out in the Force as best he can to her, reaching under his shields to drape around her like a shawl or a warm arm on a cold night. To his surprise, she darts in, wrapping her arms around him. “I missed you so much,” she chokes. Obi-Wan blinks down at her, tucking her into his side. “I missed you too,” he murmurs. She stays there, pressed into him-in-another-body, until they pull into orbit above Coruscant, where his young friends pull reluctantly away so he can be returned to himself. He can’t wait.

    Summary
      Obi-Wan sighs, and closes his eyes, swallowing down the sudden urge to violently empty the meagre contents of his stomach. He can't remember when he last ate, or slept, for that matter - sometime after he got back to the Negotiator? - and now. This.He's also fending off a panic attack, but that's beside the point. He has one of those every day, even though this one might be marginally less manageable than the rest.Considering, well, his old Master has travelled forwards in time, apparently, and of all the places he had to end up in, it was on the bridge of the Negotiator, right in front of Cody's nose, and his wonderful, amazing, scarily competent commander immediately stunned Qui-Gon and. That had been that.Except not. At all. ---OR: the one where Qui-Gon comes back to haunt everyone in flesh and blood; Cody is tired, angry, and emotionally constipated - and Obi-Wan just wants a hug.

    Summary
      He wakes up to his life lying face down in fine, waterlogged sand knowing too much yet nothing at all. The diamond-shaped implant lodged his wrist, an aching, foreign body surrounded by raw tissue, labels him CT-7567. He knows this number represents him. He does not know how he knows this. OR: The sexy dinosaur-riding wilderness survival fic you didn't know you needed. Star Wars / Ark: Survival Evolved crossover. No knowledge of Ark required.
