    Summary
      “I promise, little electric spirit of this shrine,” he whispered into the soft dirt and fallen leaves, “I will never gain the eyes. I will never pass them on. And I will make sure the eyes end in my brother, so that they can’t hurt anybody anymore. I will be the last Uchiha, and see to the end of the Copy-Wheel Clan. Then all of the hatred here can stop, and my family can rest peacefully. I promise, little shrine.”Sasuke is more than his brother thinks he is. He's more than any Uchiha has ever been. He will kill his brother, but it will not be vengeance. It will be mercy.

    Summary
      Katsuki has known Deku longer than either of them can remember. He knows that the nerd didn't have a quirk before UA. With Deku, it was never about what the nerd had, it was always about the things he was missing. If only Deku wasn't too oblivious to notice he was missing more than just a quirk. Katsuki's life would be a lot easier, that's for sure. When one of Katsuki's friends gets injured during hero training, Katsuki comes to the realization that Deku's weirdness isn't just a problem for Katsuki anymore. Civilians could get hurt someday, and his classmates are learning some fucked up ideas now. Thank goodness Katsuki is clever enough to clear up his class's misconceptions and make Deku someone else's problem, all in fifteen minutes flat.

    Summary
      Father keeps on telling Zuko that he's acting without honor, but a lot of the time he won't explain what exactly Zuko is doing wrong, and what he should do to be more honorable. So, Zuko decides to do some research and ask around about how he should behave honorably. Or: the servants of the Fire Lord's palace develop a soft spot for Zuko, Zuko confuses everyone around him with his particular brand of shout-y, aggressive politeness, and somehow Zuko accidentally ends up leading a revolution.edit: update on the status of this fic in the end notes

Having Midoriya and Todoroki starring as romantic leads in their 2nd year school play wasn't planned, that just happened.But since the boys are in this situation anyway, why not meddle, just a little, to get the oblivious idiots to admit their feelings to each other?

    Summary
      Midoriya Izuku is medically quirkless, not technically homeless, perpetually exhausted and doing his damned best despite it all. He also sees spirits, which might be cool if not for the fact that a) no one else does, b) they really don't like him very much, and c) he's pretty sure the heroes now think he's a villain working for the League.Aizawa Shota just wants to take down Overhaul, rescue Eri, keep his students alive, get some rest, and find out how this Deku kid knows things he absolutely should not know about his personal life and the Shie Hassaikai case.Unless Nighteye's right, and the kid really is a villain.

      Bookmarker's Notes
        Full to the brim with inspired allusions without ever once being derivative. Every chapter is well-paced and meticulously crafted to bring out the beauty of the setting, the moment, and the characters. There is a depth written into this world that makes the relationships feel meaningful, and so the kindness Aizawa and Deku in particular embody becomes tangible. Also, the original characters are delightful and essential. Reading this story is heartwarming.
