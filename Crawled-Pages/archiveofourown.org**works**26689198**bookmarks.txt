    Summary
      “Is this Wonderland? Am I Alice? Have I gone down the rabbit hole? Have I gone completely mad?” Xiao Zhan finds himself in Gusu after a night of drinking himself into oblivion in order to forget about Wang Yibo and how he broke Xiao Zhan's heart. If waking up in Wei Wuxian's shoes is not puzzling enough, Xiao Zhan also has to deal with mysterious cases, two teenagers falling in love, Lan Qiren's dislike, Jiang Cheng's moody behaviour, and a powerful attraction to the man that looks just like Yibo but is so different in many ways: Lan Wangji.
