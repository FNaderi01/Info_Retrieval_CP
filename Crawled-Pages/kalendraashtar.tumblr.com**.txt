                            fickeepingtheshipafloat asked: I must ask if you had a specific song(s) in mind for the club scene? In reading multiple times different songs pop in my head for the background and was just curious ... ❤️Hey sweets! Sorry for taking me a while to answer this, but I had a crazy week at work and haven’t been online much at all. I didn’t have a specific song in mind for the club scene between Ophelia and Hector, but I listened to a few on repeat as I wrote the chapter: Florence + The Machine - Cosmic Love // Muse - Madness // Billie Eilish - I love you. Curious to know the ones that came to you! ❤️

It’s such a feel-good romance. I hope you decide to read it and enjoy it as much as I did. Hello darling! Thank you for this rec, will definitely look into it and include it in my TBR list! :)) I’m touched that you thought of me to share this rec with. ❤️

                            Anonymous asked: Kal, I’m loving DS! So glad you’re writing something other than OL as I love your writing and I’m completely over J&amp;C / OL. Normal People is now my jam. I can’t get over Daisy and Paul - so talented and their chemistry! I’ve been watching interviews of them and I’m floored by how eloquent and articulate they both are especially considering their ages. When I think back to Sam’s interviews they were all basically the same couple tag lines and a lot of unnecessary sexual innuendos. SMH. Hey, lovely! I’m glad you’re enjoying DS. It feels good to be connected with my own writing again. I’m done with OL in all the ways a person can be done with a fandom, I think. It still saddens me, but not as much as it did a while back. Yet, to be fair, interviews related to the show were always severely hindered by the spoiler phobia and plug production put on everything. Have a brilliant Sunday! X

                            Anonymous asked: I just read Dark Shines and is so fucking great,  this JF reminded me to Charlie Parker from John Connolly. I enjoy it a lot!!. I don't know when you wrote this but there is more? A second part? In the meantime I'll read some of your other fanfics ✨Hey, lovely! Sorry it took me so long, but I haven’t been on Tumblr much lately. I’m chuffed that you enjoyed Dark Shines. There isn’t more in the Outlander fanfic form, but I’ve turned it into an original story and I’ve started Part II/Murder II, which I plan to continue soon! You can read it on AO3 if you’re interested. Hugs! X

I feel a bit incomplete without it.This year has been a challenge so far, for me as for mostly everyone. I have some vacation time coming next week, so maybe I can work a bit on it. Hopefully. Not sure on what, but I’ll try. ❤️
