    Summary
      Once betrothed to Jaime Lannister before the Mad King cruelly took away his choice at marriage, Celia Tully’s fate is once more decided upon by a dragon sitting upon the throne. Her marriage to the king’s younger brother is not that of love, but of politics. She is the good sister of the head of Hous Arryn and Stark, the niece of the head of House Whent, and the daughter of the head of House Tully. It is not for her that the Shadow Prince meets her at the alter of the great sept, but for her name and connections. As Celia navigates her new life, she must battle with her feelings for the man never allowed to be her own and the husband who has shown her more kindness than he needs to.

    Summary
      “Um, wait.” Now Jungkook’s just reeling. “Let me get this straight.”“You want to pay me to be my trophy wife? How does that even work!?”“I prefer the term job-required spouse. But trophy wife is good too. Makes me sound spicy.”Never in his 25 years of life would Jungkook think that he’d hear a superior refer to themself as spicy. Then again, most superiors were not grossly underqualified corporate nepotism beneficiaries who were willing to marry someone in order to get out of their job..._______Kim Seokjin has it all. The looks, the job and enough money to buy Jeju island. Or at least, that’s what most people think.The truth is, he wants out of the corporate hell he’s found himself in and he doesn’t care about what it takes to get there. Jeon Jungkook happens to be the one holding the key to the door.

      Rey Shaw is a college student working as a tour guide in what was one of the most beautiful estates in The Antebellum South. And she hates it. Hates living in this stupid region. Hates all the old plantation houses, blooming magnolia trees, and wet heat. Oh and Ben Solo. She really hates him. One day while giving a tour she slips and falls, plummeting into a Civil War time warp, where slavery rules and good men are hard to find.

    Summary
      Aurelianus grew up not knowing who he truly was, or where he came from. The people of Hogwarts know him as the 15-year-old Slytherin taller than most 7th years, the Slytherin who doesn't speak. Despite his impressive height, Aurelianus is but a shadow in the castle, and that is how he prefers it. However, a new Law passed by the Ministry requiring 4th year students and up to get an inheritance test, will undoubtedly throw his entire perspective into a downward spiral as everything he knew is proven wrong.

    Summary
      You think you know what happened when those kids went missing in nineteen eighty-seven, right? Think again. 
William Afton and Harry Potter...two entirely different people who shouldn't be connected, right? Well, perhaps not. Look inside if you want to know what really happened. And please, stay awhile and enjoy the show.
We'll be seeing you soon~

    Summary
      What happens when you combine the magical world of Harry Potter and Greek Mythology? You get witches and wizards who fulfill the roles of gods and goddesses and straddle the Wizarding and Immortal or mythical realms. The plot begins during the summer between "Half-Blood Prince" and "Deathly Hallows."'Lost in her thoughts, she didn't notice the rustle of wind behind her and the shiver that ran down her spine until someone grabbed her. The coldness of the hands made her think of a dementor, but Hermione couldn't think much more about that as her stomach dropped and she realized she was flying on a broom. Her eyes were closed, too afraid to look to see how high she was.“Scared, Granger?” a deep voice growled in her ear. It was familiar, but in the gravity of the situation, she couldn’t place it. Daringly, she opened her eyes, enough to glimpse where she was being taken, a strong arm secured around her waist. Her world went black as she saw they were headed straight for the ground.'

    Summary
      INSPIRED BY "THE LOBSTER " &amp; "The Good Place"In an alternative universe where the UK was heavily influenced by a previous war population each and every person has a "soulmate" assigned for them by the government upon taking several "tests", (personality, aptitude, preference etc), then are matched and required to live together for a year and hopefully produce children. Alec Marsters has a great life until one day a letter informs him that his"match" has been found, a certain Mara Lawrence. Upon seeing her.. He is CERTAIN a big mistake has been made and this couldn't possibly be his match..Or could she?VISUAL: ALEC LOOKS LIKE HENRY CAVILL IN A SUITP.s. I live in the Netherlands so that is why I chose my country as the one THE UK fought with.p.s.2: Randomly thought of "Anderson Cooper" as the law firm Alec (Henry Cavill's character works at because I thought of the journalist Anderson Cooper. The surname Marsters is a tribute to Buffy the Vampire Slayer actor : James Marsters.Ps3: I need to find a job but instead I keep writing.. Hope you like this!

    Summary
      Clarus Amicitia and his young son took everything from her, so she would take what they loved in return. Even if one was the boy who would have been King if Lucis was still a Monarchy, another the nephew of a disgraced politician and the third maybe related to Besithia of all people. She didn't care about that and when she was done with them it wouldn't matter anyway, they would all be hers.

    Summary
  “This is…”
  “What? You gonna complain about the shit I’ve added to the contract?”
  “…it’s somewhat presumptuous, isn’t it? To add that neither is allowed to fall in love with the other.”
Shouto has a goal, even if it's a petty one; he wants to see the Todoroki dukedom end with him, and he wants to see his father's face when he realizes that Shouto has chosen to marry a man.Shouto might not have considered what marrying this specific man would entail, besides those two things.※DO NOT REPOST / HOST MY WORK ON OTHER APPS OR SITES
