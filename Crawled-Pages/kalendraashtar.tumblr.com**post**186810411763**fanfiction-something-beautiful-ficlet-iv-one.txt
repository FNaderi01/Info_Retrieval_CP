                            Fanfiction - Something Beautiful (Ficlet IV) - One Quote One Shot
                            Duck and Sassenach are back!!! Thank you @notevenjokingfic and @balfeheughlywed, the masterminds behind this amazing challenge that has already given us so much. My blessings forever upon @holdhertightandsayhername, for listening to me freaking out over this non-stop. My quote: 
“I know what ye meant, Sassenach.” He said, turning his head to look up at me. “Never worry, the six inches that are left are all between my legs.”Chapters and FicletsSomething BeautifulFiclet IV – Sun-kissedWhile Jamie and I had
spent several holidays together, both in Scotland and abroad, the novelty of
packing up a bag with contents meant to be seen by my lover during a week in
the sun (relaxed, playful, unhurried) was inebriating. This time around
we’d be sharing a bed and all the activities that went with it; even my
practical and laid-back nature couldn’t resist a sneaky trip downtown to
acquire a few handpicked new bikinis, flowy sundresses and luxurious undergarments.The business of
deciding a destination hadn’t been seamless; our new life together seemed to
expand with possibilities, an open-spaced house without constraining walls to
bump upon, and we were starved to experience everything, all at once.
Jamie suggested a snowtrip, talking in that spellbinding lilt about physical
exertion on the ski slopes, followed by cosy fires at the lodge and mulled wine
we could sip from each other’s lips. Even if the concept was undeniably
appealing, my clumsy nature and patent lack of bodily coordination, quickly
made work of discouraging me. “I’ll end up with a
bloody hip fracture.” I protested, scrunching my nose. “And we will be doomed
to several weeks – maybe even months – of a remarkably unimaginative sex
life, with a lot of physical therapy to cope with.” I tapped my naked hip with
a dry snap, enhancing how I would be unable to rotate it in any significative
way. “Unless you’re really adamant on beginning our practice early for our
freaky eighties, let’s not.”Jamie, irritatingly
prone to all sports and physical prowess, clicked his tongue in disappointment
– but undoubtedly his horror of being condemned to perform an adaptation of the
missionary position in perpetuity crushed any further protests. We quickly
agreed on a sunny destination, where we could stroll ancient streets filled
with golden sunlight hand in hand, and lounge at the beach with an unlimited
supply of an alcoholic beverage of our choice. After some detailed Google
Maps scouting; careful exploration of flights (too expensive, too long,
too many layovers) and resorts; and a heated debate on budget and time
period for our escapade, we giggled our way through the booking of a one-week
vacation in Malta - like two teenagers, planning a much-anticipated shag on a
folded blanket on the back of a pickup truck, loaned from a complacent uncle.On the eve of our
trip I barely slept, excitement like a liquid thing filling every indent with a
vibrant orange energy. Jamie, a firm believer of the sacred nature of sleeping
whenever you had the chance, softly snored beside me unfazed, his regular
breath against the curve of my neck making me dream of the warm breeze by the
Mediterranean Sea.Our flight landed in La
Valletta, Malta’s quirky capital, around lunchtime. We pushed through the
crowds at the small airport to swiftly retrieve our luggage, Jamie particularly
eager to stretch his legs after being crammed in his seat like a reluctant yoga
practitioner; the narrow aircraft clearly hadn’t been built to accommodate the
progeny of Viking blood (“My bahoochie is that numb, Sassenach”). After dropping our
belongings at our first accommodation, a lovely and airy AirBnb
apartment close to the Grand Harbour that would shelter us for our city
wanderings in the next couple of days, we scurried outside with a new groove in
our gait (simple happiness, a kind of mindless sensuality from the warmth
around us, an almost dance to the song stuck in our heads that was playing in
the Uber’s radio).“What do you want to
do first, Duck?” I asked Jamie between two generous bites on a pastizzi,
a traditional fluffy pastry filled to the brim with delicious and creamy
ricotta cheese, that I had acquired from a friendly street vendor, yapping in a
comical blend of maltese and english. The food was a bit salty, like the winds
coming from the sea itself, and tasted of light and a life under the sun.He hesitated,
throwing me a somewhat embarrassed look over his qassatat, fragrant with
the pungency of cheese, peas and spinach mixed together. “I – Well, Sassenach
–““I’m not going back
to the room, Jamie!” I reprehended him with a laugh, interpreting his
mortification as a veiled suggestion of an afternoon sweaty romp instead of proper
touristic activities. “There’s certainly time for that later, when our feet
are a bit tired.”“That wasna it.”
He dabbed at this mouth with a napkin, jumbled, adjusting his aviator Ray-Ban
sunglasses (he looked like a fucking movie star, a reloaded Scottish version
of Top Gun). “I was wonderin’ if we could just walk for a while with no
destiny, while I hold yer hand?” Jamie said in a husky voice, mussing up his
hair in nervousness. He was wearing blue shorts and a grey t-shirt that greatly
complimented his beautifully-made-and-dutifully-maintained body, attracting
coveting glances from both local women and sallow newly-arrived sightseers.
“For sae long, it was everything I ever wanted – to hold yer hand and walk
beside ye, knowing I wouldn’t have to let go.”“Yes. We can
do that.” I breathed out, pulling his hand to force him to a halt in the middle
of the cobbled street, my trembling fingers dislodging his sunglasses from the
bridge of his sharp nose. I framed Jamie’s face, looking into his eyes for a
long wordless moment – so that he was reassured, once more, that my hand was
entirely his to hold –, before I tiptoed and kissed him deeply and
languidly. From the doorway of a traditional house, where a couple of old
Maltese women enjoyed the shade, came a whistle and a crude whoop. “This time I’m
ignoring it.” Jamie whispered in my ear, hugging me against him with confidence.
“I’m definitely swallowing you.” We chuckled wholeheartedly with the
memory of our first kiss by the coastal road in Aberdeen, our foreheads pressed
together, before we strolled down the street with our hands firmly linked.The balconies and doors
of the buildings surrounding us were an explosion of colour, as baroque cages
of watercolour-painted birds, made of vibrant blue, saffron yellow, strawberry
red and forest green. I stopped every few steps to take photos with my phone’s
camera, while Jamie read aloud from a guide on Il-Belt, The City
(the destruction of the Royal Opera House during Wold War II; the nickname
Superbissima; the Rising of the Priests further back in time). During our
route across the blurred yellow paths - as if every home had been made out of
the sand’s pure grace - we enjoyed some rest inside cool stone archways,
savouring ice-cream cones with the zing of Mediterranean lemons and almost
too-sweet peaches. I took out my straw hat to allow my scalp to cool down a
bit, parting my heavy brown locks from the moist back of my neck with my
fingers, as Jamie studied the map on his phone and smiled at me with a glorious
balminess in his eyes. When our stomachs
growled loudly, announcing a biological dinner bell, we found an inviting
little restaurant with tables on a terrace, which allowed us to munch seasoned plump
green olives as we watched the magnificent sunset. We were served lavish plates
of aljotta, a hearty fish stew, thickened with garlic, tomatoes and
rice, nicely paired with mugs of cisk, a locally brewed beer with a
gentle flavour.“My last memory of my
father was in a place like this.” I caressed Jamie’s knuckles on top of the
table, his piercing blue eyes lingering on me. Throughout the years I had
shared with him the early days of my existence, printed in that faded and
blotched ink of loss; but I’d never shared with him that particularly fond
memory. “We were having dinner somewhere in Italy, the three of us. It was just
before we came back to England and he –“ I paused and my boyfriend grazed the
back of my hand with his lips, silently anchoring me to the present. “We were so
happy. He and my mum were always stealing small kisses and touches from
each other and I pretended I was disgusted.” The white and red checkered towel
lightly swaying in the dusk’s breeze seemed to wave back at the memory of Henry
Beauchamp (the sky an unwritten epopee about the countless shades of pink,
orange and blue; the very firmament a flushed girl under the eye of a lover).
“I thought I’d never find a love like that.” I smiled tenderly at him. “But
I did.”“May we thrive and
live to disgust our own bairns someday.” Jamie hummed, placing a curl
behind my ear in such a way that his fingertips lingered there a moment longer
than necessary. “Do ye feel like dessert, Sassenach?”“Very much so.” I
brushed my hair to the side, exposing the high column of my velvet-white neck –
I knew he found it strangely irresistible. “But maybe not the kind that’s on
the menu here.” Back at our rented accommodations, Jamie left
the lights off and the large balcony doors wide open, so our naked bodies
seemed like two ghosts meeting in the silvery air of the underworld, after
millennia of roaming in search of each other. He sat me on the high dresser and
slowly slid my knickers down my legs, nuzzling the backside of my knee and
whispering about the alluring scent of my sunscreen, the stardust of freckles
appearing on my marble skin and how I was “gantin’ for him”.  What followed was the service of his mouth, determined
in an unprecedented way as he kneeled before me, able of bending the rules of
time in my favour (“give yerself to me, Claire”).Wednesday of our
vacation week found us travelling to the isle of Comino, towards the
famous Blue Lagoon area. After a more urban adventure, we were both
eager to escape to the beach – me, for some much-anticipated suntanning time;
and Jamie, to do some scuba diving since the country was a kind of holy-place
for the diving-lovers in Europe, with reefs, caves and wrecks to no end.“How did you persuade
me to do this, again?” I complained mordantly, pathetically attempting to walk
with my feet inserted into large fins. The ensemble formed by the partially
dressed wetsuit, paired with the ridiculous (to me) footwear and snorkel
mask was ruining the desired effect of my sexy red bathing suit. I felt like some
freakish nautical experiment that had gone horribly wrong.“The possibility of a
retribution of yer choosing, I believe.” Jamie offered me a lopsided smile, checking
the valve of his own gear. Since he was a certified diving instructor, we were
able to do an expedition on our own – a status I appreciated more than ever,
watching him intently with his broad naked chest glistening in the sun, the
sleeves of his suit dangling at his waist. I had spent years rationalizing how
attractive he was – his body protected from my eyes by firm boundaries of
close friendship -, so I enjoyed every blissful chance to gaze at leisure.  “That, and the promise of a full day of behaving
like lobsters tomorrow.”“Talking about
reddish sweaty seafood,” I eyed his shoulders critically, where a slight
pinkish tone was appearing. “Shouldn’t you apply some sunscreen, Duck? We
aren’t really used to this merciless heat.”“I’m a Highlander,
lass.” He cocked a ruddy brow as if that was explanation enough, offering me a
pair of much more comfortable dive booties to replace my fins. “We are bred to
endure what others cannot.”I rolled my eyes at
his brazen cockiness. “Suit yourself. Us the inferior race of the lowlands
will be using SPF 50.” Diving with Jamie was
like seeing a man erect himself into completion, more defined under that
transparency, choosing a current to navigate that pulsed with his own heart. In
the water, Jamie was in his element – and I was his guest, invited to share
with him the sacredness of the ebb and flow. He twirled around me at ease, moving
swiftly and effortlessly, as I excitedly pointed at a peculiar sea-creature
passing by. “You’re truly at home
there, aren’t you?” I asked him later, when we were together curled on a
towel, enjoying the late afternoon sun. My fingers were attracted to his small
stubble, as his were attracted to the dimples on my lower back. “I feel like
the sea has a part of you that only exists there. That I know more of you now,
because of it.”“Ye’re like the sea
to me, mo nighean donn.” He confessed in a low voice, before he brushed
my lips with his.***“I’m trying not to
gloat right now, but you’re making it so very hard.” I covered my mouth
with my palm, trying not to cackle at sight in front of me. “You look slightly
overcooked, my lad.” I bit my bottom lip, examining the vivid redness of Jamie’s
skin, fortunately devoid of the alarming blisters of a second-degree burn. “I
thought you said Highlanders were made to outstand the fury of elements.”“I gather that only
applies to drizzle, cold and gust, Sassenach.” Jamie admitted between clenched
teeth, moaning softly when he rolled to his side on the bed of our resort suit,
like a piece of extra-crispy bacon. “My whole body feels like it has been
scrubbed with a hot chilli, except maybe the grand total of six inches.”“Six inches, huh?” I
snorted, picking up the bottle of after-sun cream from the nightstand. “And I
had such plans for the last couple of days of our vacation. Not that I
mean to sound insensitive.”“I know what ye
meant, Sassenach.” He said, turning his head to look up at me. “Never worry,
the six inches that are left are all between my legs.”“Too bad they
don’t need rubbing at this time, then.” I raised a wicked brow and mercilessly
squirted cold moisturizing lotion, with a faint whiff of aloe and camomile,
directly into his scalding back, making him yelp aloud.
