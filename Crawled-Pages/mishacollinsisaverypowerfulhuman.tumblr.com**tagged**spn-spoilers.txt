Both in the sense of traditional american holidays and folkish culture but also as the song.  Dean’s theme (americana) is about family, about the things you would do for them and to protect them.  It is *frequently* about the lines you’d cross (I just watched 9.11 two weeks ago and having the theme there reflecting Dean taking the Mark was... painful, but also enlightening in how the use of the theme has expanded over the years.)But that wasn’t the right approach here.  You don’t sacrifice part of your family to save the rest, or the “favorite” (which was Sam, and mrs. B is a Dean mirror: caretaker, love language involves food and spending time, done dark things bc of trauma, will do anything to protect family).  Hiding the pain and the trauma isn’t the way forward.  Desperate attempts isn’t the solution.The next few eps are going to be interesting, that’s for sure.

                                                                        has anyone discussed the ridiculous overkill move of Sam and Dean bringing their weapons on the various hunts in the montage? Only during the first hunt did we know in advance what they were hunting, but the info we got about that hunt had to serve as a template for all the rest of them, because every other aspect (from them running past the kitchen to grab their monogrammed lunch sacks to them breaking down a door to take down the monsters) was exact for each successive hunt.So the setup here was that Mrs. B’s powers made the tracking system work. It picked up a vampire nest FIFTY MILES AWAY down to the exact street address where they were. It was, firstly, an interesting callback to the BMoL’s monster tracking capabilities, and makes me wonder if they employed a similar being to power their own systems, or if they’d been tapping into Mrs. B’s powers more directly. It’s moot now, but still interesting.What is even more interesting is the nature of the “vampire nest” they actually crashed in on. I’m not sure if Sam and Dean really even bothered to check for themselves, short of confirming these were actually vampires (they, of course, stood up and unleashed the fangs and hissing, because honestly if someone kicked down your door in a raid wouldn’t you pull out every defense you had?). But did they bother to notice these vamps hadn’t reportedly bitten anyone? Or that they were drinking bagged blood out of bendy straws and not sucking people dry? These– in any other episode ever– would not be targeted monsters.And yes, they did discuss that they were using these vamps as a test of sorts for Mrs. B– a test of her story she’d told them, and to prove whether or not she was lying about anything… but beyond proving that these were indeed vampires, they never seemed to look any deeper at WHY they were being targeted for destruction, you know?So… back to the weapons. They were expecting vampires, went in armed with machetes, and beheaded, as one does with vampires. So the theory should hold that they knew exactly what waited for them on the other side of every door they went through for the rest of that montage. The second hunt, Mrs. B tells them it’s a lamia and that she put blessed knives in the trunk of the car for them. Weird, because we haven’t seen a lamia since s6 when all the monsters were going off book because of Crowley stirring the pot looking for the way into Purgatory. Strangely enough, the lamia killed the priest before he could bless their knives in 6.04, and Dean had called Bobby in a panic while it tossed Sam around the room, and had to cover it with rosemary and salt and set it on fire to kill it. Presumably being forewarned and forearmed this time around was instantly successful, but we don’t see anything of that particular hunt.From that point on, we only see the “kicking the door down” part of each of their hunts, and have no idea what they were hunting, but assume they were equally aptly armed for each hunt.First, it’s hard to tell, but it looks like Sam has the demon knife and Dean has an angel blade. So they were probably after demons to have picked those specific weapons.Second, they’re both armed with handguns. Common enough, but useless against a lot of things they hunt unless they were loaded with special bullets (silver, iron, etc.), and so we have no idea what they were actually hunting that time, but they went in confident they were sufficiently armed.We don’t even see the third hunt, barring them collecting their lunch bags, before they return for the 4th of July celebration.and then the final hunt… they don’t kick the door down, they BLOW IT TF UP. Dean is armed with the grenade launcher, and Sam has Mjolnir, which we haven’t seen since 8.02. Nice to know they kept it, though. So did they grenade the door to smithereens or launch lightning at it? Either way, pretty serious overkill for like 99% of things they face, yes? Grenades AND a weapon of gods.And we have no idea what they were even hunting, or why.I just found all of this interesting, especially given that last hunt.
                                                                        angelswatchingover
                                                                        I made that same observation about the first vamp hunt. Like those guys were not shown as a danger to anyone, sipping bagged blood from plastic curly straws and watching old movies then the Winchesters burst in and just behead them. Like WTF? I sure hope they did at least some investigative work first and found out if they were actually guilty of anything.
                                                                        mittensmorgul
                                                                        OMG they were watching an ancient episode of Dark Shadows! And lamenting their rather sad lives in comparison to Barnabas Collins! I mean, how much more downtrodden and sad does a vampire get? Poor babs, if they were guilty of anything, it was of being the least threatening vamps ever on this show. They lived only 50 miles from the bunker, and still hadn’t managed to ping the Winchesters’ radar in all the years they’ve been there. I feel awful for them.
                                                                        charlie-minion

But that was the point, right? They killed two innocent vampires simply because they were *monsters*. It foreshadowed the fact that Mrs. B would want to have Jack killed just because he was Lucifer’s son, without actually checking if he was dangerous or not. An old theme of the Man of Letters (and even John Winchester) that all monsters had to be killed, no matter what. However, the Winchesters have learned better; they have learned to love the “monster ” who accidentally killed their mother, as opposed to “we have to kill the thing that killed mom”.

When Sam gave it at the hospital last season Dean looked shocked and horrified. Think how far Dean must have come to celebrate it by baking!
