    Summary
      With the entire world hunting him down, Peter has gone incognito. Unfortunately for him, Hydra sees this as an opportunity to replace their Winter Soldier. No one is watching. No one is going to notice he's even gone. Brock Rumlow grabs Peter off the streets and introduces him to Hydra's new gig: harboring inter-galactic species on Earth for profit. Hydra provides the supplies that aliens need to go undetected on earth, in exchange for advances in technology and power. However, Hydra doesn't have as much control as they think, and things are going to go south if Peter can't stop it.There's non-con of Rumlow/Peter, as Rumlow is Peter's handler, but I'm going to put notes in so you can skip it if that's not your cup of tea.

      "Sir, I have the results.”“Okay, Jarvis. Hit me.”“It’s a match. 99.9% chance that he is your biological son, which is the percentage needed to be recognized by law as a biological parent.”Tony’s stomach did a funny swooping dance. “Great. Congratulations to me then, eh? It’s a boy.”

    Summary
      Magic.It's like entropy--inaccessable energy in a system. To have magic is to break the rules of your universe, and to become a magical girl is to take that power and use it for good.April 10th, Izuku broke the rules of his universe, and now, with the world facing a growing, seemingly indomitable threat, he and his Handyman get ready for the ride of a lifetime.This story thus details Midoriya Izuku's life as a magical girl in the world of heroes.This is a "Crack Treated Seriously" story, in which a completely implausible and ridiculous scenario is treated almost as seriously as any other fictional work, save for some cases of humor.Estimated Update Date: *shrug* Concept art and references are currently on my blog.Please don’t send constructive criticism unless asked, I finish chapters at 2 am.
