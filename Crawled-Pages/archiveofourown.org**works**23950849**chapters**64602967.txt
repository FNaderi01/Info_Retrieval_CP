        Notes:
          To anyone wondering, no I am not sick or something worse. I just started working along with taking classes so have been a little too tired to write more. But know that the story is not abandoned, it just means  the updates are slow. And I wanna thank you all so much for your support. I absolutely love all the comments.
    Chapter Text
  And anything his baby boy wants, Bucky will make sure to provide. 
 Bucky watched Tony fuck little Harry lazily for over thirty minutes before finally picking up his speed and finishing. Harry’s little hole looked adorable, slightly gaping and oozing cum. Bucky thought about asking Steve to draw a painting of Harry like that. Harry looked like a debauched angel. With his hair splayed around his head like a halo, and covered partially by the white sheets. His skin having an unearthly glow from Tony’s arc reactor. 
    He had to admit, he assumed Tony didn't have much strength and endurance. But this proved differently. Sure, it was nothing close to how ruthless Bucky could piston his hips and for how long. But Tony still seems to be of above-average strength for a non enhanced human being. His strokes were meticulous and purposeful. He stated every now and then to run his fingers through Harry’s hair or place a kiss on his temple.
 After Tony finished, he made sure to put a diaper on Harry properly. He knew within a few minutes his cum would start to ooze out of the perfect puffy asshole. Tony looked up to see Bucky watching him avidly. He smirked. “What? Are you really surprised that I like to use him while he sleeps? And just so you know, he loves it. That’s why he was able to sleep through it, got a lot of practice sleeping through being fucked like a fleshlight”.  
 Bucky shook his head and smiled a little. Of course Tony Stark would have a dirty mouth. Not that Bucky judged that would be like the pot calling the kettle black. He himself could make a sailor blush. His blase comments about his exploits had always make Steve blush a furious shade of red. 
    Once Harry was nicely tucked in with a pacifier on his mouth that he started sucking in immediately, the two avengers came to sit in the living area. Tony offered drinks to Bucky which he declined. So now they just sat together awkwardly, not sure what to say or do. Bucky contemplated leaving but that left a sour taste in his gut. Tony knew he could go to his workshop to relax but didn’t feel comfortable being away from Harry after Wanda’s attack.
    “So anything you wanna talk about Bucky? Maybe about becoming a dadda in a few short hours?” Tony asked nonchalantly. He hadn’t forgotten about that. That Harry, in his state of distress had called Bucky his ‘dadda’.
    Bucky was hoping not to draw attention to that fact but he should have known that Tony Stark was too smart to leave it alone. “Look Tony I know compared to you there isn’t much I can do for him, but you are a busy man if you two are comfortable with it I would like to take care of little Harry when you are busy in the office or in your workshop. I know the bond you two share is deep and I promise I won’t try to come between that”.
    “I get what you are saying. And you don’t need to plead your case to me. Harry is his own person and can choose for himself. As long as he likes you, I have no issue with you. I know monogamy is seen as the clear path or whatever, but it’s not the path for everyone”. Tony got up from his seat to get themselves some beers. If he was gonna talk all philosophical he deserved a drink even if it wasn’t a hard liquor.
    “ I want my baby boy to have the best of everything a c and be as happy as humanly possible. And I am not naive enough to think I can provide it all to him. I mean think about it if I spend all my time with him, both Avengers and. Stark industries would suffer, and Harry wouldn’t want that. What I am trying to say is as long as he is happy I don’t care if it’s with just me, with you and me or heck the whole team. The main goal here is to give him a comfortable home and people that care about his happiness”.
    Bucky honestly couldn’t agree more with it. In a few short hours it was as if Harry was already a part of his soul. “Alright I will talk to him and ask him dire….” Bucky never got to finish his sentence as both men jumped to their feet hearing the gut wrenching scream coming from the master suite.
    Both avengers stormed to the room expecting to see some attacker looming over little Harry  but all they saw was Harry fighting against the sheets he was tucked under clearly having a nightmare. Harry was mumbling something in his sleep so they came closer do you hear him clearly and also to comfort him.
    “I’m sorry Uncle Vernon ….Please no sorry….. no… ahhah … it hurts no please no more…”
    Bucky took away the sheet Harry was still struggling against and Tony picked up Harry and settled him in his lap. He started rocking him and tried to wake Harry gently. Bucky hovered over them nervously. Who the fuck was this Vernon?? And when can Bucky kill him??
    After a few tense moments in his daddy’s arms, Harry finally woke up. He looked around himself to check Vernon wasn’t here and that he was with his daddy and his dadda was near too. He started to whimper and extended a hand towards Dadda. He was too far away!!
    Bucky seeing the hand came closer and sat beside Tony. He let Harry hold on to his thumb and places his other hand on Harry’s thigh, rubbing it soothingly. “I am so sorry You had a bad dream baby boy. But you are safe, you are here with us. We won’t let anyone hurt you”.
    Bucky is right Harry. I promise you I will do anything I need to keep you safe. And I know you don’t wanna think about it. But I think it’s time I meet this Vernon and you get closure so you can finally move on in life” Tony added softly.
    Harry tensed at the name of his uncle, but tried his best to breath through it. Daddy was right though and Harry knew it. Simply ignoring the issue isn’t working anymore. Now that the war is finally over and he finally has a chance to be happy, somehow his old ghosts are still coming in to haunt him. He nodded his head minutely to show his consent to the idea and snuggled in his daddy’s arms.
    “ I don’t want to sleep in the bed anymore daddy. Can I just sleep in your arms?” Harry asked cutely.
    Tony chucked in response. But before he could say anything Bucky offered to Harry little Harry all day if needed. Tony just looked at the winter soldier and smiled. He handed over Harry back to Bucky. With the way Bucky was trying to be so careful with Harry, it was as if he was holding on to a newborn baby.
    “ I know it’s sudden Bucky but would you like to move into my floor? I can have another room arranged for you or for now you can sleep in this bed you know I don’t mind and it’s big enough for the three of us. This way even if I’m busy Harry would have you close by”.
    Becky was a little surprised at the suggestion but he didn’t really mind. He was currently sharing a floor with Steve but he knew Steve would understand. He could easily keep a bedroom on Steve's floor and get another one here. That way Harry could come down to his room once in a while too if he wanted.
    “Thank you Tony I would like that” he said to his fellow avenger. “What do you say Harry? Would you like me to stay closer to you?” He asked Harry who had his face buried in his neck. 
    Harry perked up at that and looked up at his dadda with his big green doe eyes. “I would love that dadda, thank you. Thank you for being nice to me and thinking I am a freak”. Harry added the last part softly. Feeling shy for saying it but also unable to stop himself. His magic sang in his body. Thrumming at the close contact to these two men.
    Harry knew he needed to perform some spells or his magic would overwhelm him. He shifted around a little more before finally gathering enough courage to ask what he wanted“Would you like to see any magic daddy?”
    Tony too was instantly perked up at the suggestion. He had so many questions too. But clearly Harry didn’t wanna talk. So demonstration it is. “Can you fly?”
    Harry let out a giggle and shook his head. “Not in the way you are thinking, I think. I can’t fly on my own, but I can on a broom.”
    As an answer to that Tony just had more questions. How exactly that works, how the broom is made, if it's safe for little Harry? How fast does it do? Harry just smiled and giggled and tried to answer the best he could. He never really looked into the science behind how brooms worked, so many of the technical questions he could not answer.
    Bucky listened to the conversation with interest. Once the pair seemed to calm down a bit he decided to ask his question. “Can you show us something baby boy? Anything you want.”
    Harry summoned his wand and took a deep breath. He aimed his wand at one of the many pillows on the bed and murmured, “Wingardium Leviosa ”. He quickly diverted his eyes from the pillow to the two older men to gaze at their reactions. The weight lifted off his chest seeing the open and eager expression on their faces. They weren't scared of his magic, or disgusted by it.
    Bth men exclaimed with joy and praised Harry for it. He felt all gooey inside at their adoration. He held the spell for another few minutes before cancelling it. He thought about what else he could show and got a naughty idea. Harry now pointed his wand at his daddy and giggled before murmuring, “Evenesco”. He watched in fascination as once fully dressed Tony Stark now sat stark naked on the bed and looked down at himself amazed. Harry just couldn't help himself and giggled some more. He saw from the corner of his eyes as his dadda too was trying to hold back laughter.
    “Well that’s definitely something” Tony said with a chuckle and snagged Harry into his own lap. He started to place sloppy wet kisses all over Harry, who giggled at the attention. At this point he didn’t even remember that he just had a nightmare or what it was about, he was just so happy.
    “And don’t think I forgot baby boy, you mentioned something about being able to change your age. I promise I won’t be mad Harry but please tell me your real age is at least 18?” Tony asked once they had both calmed down a bit. Harry looked up surprised at the question and shifted a little guiltily. “I am sorry daddy that I sorta of lied and hid it from you. I turn 18 in 2 more months. But the legal age of consent in London is 16 and it's 17 in New York, I have checked. Please don’t be mad daddy. I didn’t mean to hide from you but I didn’t want you to send me away”.
    Harry started to look nervous, so Tony just hugged him tight. “ I would never send you away baby boy, but I do feel a little guilty. But I know no matter what, I could never give you up. I am just glad you are at least legal. Anyways another reason I asked was to find out if you really wanted to turn yourself younger? And don’t ask me what I want, I wanna know what you would like” Tony finished strenly.
    Harry thought about lying, brushing off his true desires so he would seem less of a freak. But he knew he couldn’t do that not to his daddy. He deserves to know the truth. He deserved to know how twisted his desires really were. So he pulled all his Gryffindor courage to tell the truth and a voice in his head that sounded suspiciously like his daddy told him that he would not be rejected. “Yes, I want to use a  spell to turn myself younger. I know it’s twisted and perverted but that’s what I want. That’s actually why I came to America in the first place I wanted to say please where I could hopefully find someone to explore my desires with. Someone who won’t see me as the boy who lived but simply is an individual wanting to try perverted things.”
Harry looked at both older men with pleading eyes. Hoping they would not reject him, hoping they would not hate him. And what he saw in their face made him relax fractionally .Neither one of them looked disgusted, they looked thoughtful and interested. Tony looked at Bucky to see where he was at. Bucky did the same and nodded his head to show that he didn’t mind if at all. So Tony took the lead and said what he wanted.
    “Well I am more than happy to try that with you baby. But not so soon. More importantly I want you to see my personal doc frost to get a health assessment before we try anything that daring. I know you didn’t want to go to the doc, and I am not gonna lie, neither do I. But I think it’s really important, from what you have told me about your childhood…” Tony didn’t finish the sentence when he saw Harry start to tense up. He started to rock Harry gently in his arms and noticed that the increased skin contact seemed to sooth Harry further. “Look there is nothing the doc could say that would make me leave you or any bull shot like that. And it doesn’t have to be tomorrow take your time maybe we can see the doc in another week, but we are not trying that fun spell of yours before that. Okay baby?”
    Harry wasn’t happy about it but he knew his daddy was right. So he just nodded his head and snuggled into his daddy’s warm chest. Bucky spoke up next. “ I agree with Stark in this too, as fun as it sounds we really should make sure you are a healthy doll. And in fact now that you are up let’s go downstairs and have some dinner.” He extended his hands to pick up Harry but Tony pouted at the action before finally handing him over.
    “Oh don’t pout now. Go get dressed so we can head downstairs. I am pretty sure the others would also like to see that Harry is okay” he said thoughtfully.
    Harry felt his cheeks redden but knew he had to ask for help so he kept his eyes on the floor when he asked, “can you change me dadda? I made a mess in my diaper”. And Bucky thought that was the sweetest and hottest thing he had ever heard. Maybe after an early dinner both he and Tony could play with Harry together.
