          Looking for help with a common request?
      I have a question about a repository on GitHub
          Repositories hosted on GitHub
            GitHub hosts millions of repositories, each with their own unique
            workflows. While we can help with issues related to GitHub.com, we aren't
            able to answer questions about repositories that are hosted on GitHub.
            For assistance, check the repository's README or SUPPORT file
            for an official website or contact information. You can also
            open an issue on the repository's issues tab, or get in touch with the repository owner directly by checking their
            GitHub profile for contact details.

      I'm seeing a GitHub Pages error
          GitHub Pages errors
            One of the most common problems GitHub Pages users run into is not seeing
            changes that they've made to their site. After you push a new commit to your
            repository, it can take up to 10 minutes for the GitHub Pages build process
            to complete and for your changes to appear.
            If it's been over 10 minutes and your changes still haven't appeared, your
            browser may be serving a cached version of the page. To fix this, you can
            reset your browser's cache or visit your site in an incognito or private browsing
            window.
            For help with other Pages errors, please see
            Troubleshooting GitHub Pages builds.

      My credit card was declined
          Credit card declines
            If your credit card was declined, please contact your credit card
            company. GitHub does not have information about why your card was
            declined.
