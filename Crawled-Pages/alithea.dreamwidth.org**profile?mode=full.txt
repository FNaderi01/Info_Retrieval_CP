                End of Gen X/almost Millennial, bi intersectional trans-inclusive feminist SJW, owned by a rescue lurcher, interested in crafty and creative stuff, reading, roleplaying, walking, costume prOn, and general geekery. Recovering academic with incorrigible editor brain. "To be nobody but yourself in a world that's doing its best to make you somebody else, is to fight the hardest battle you are ever going to fight. Never stop fighting."- E.E. Cummings"You are not here merely to make a living. You are here to enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, and with a finer spirit of hope and achievement. You are here to enrich the world. You impoverish yourself if you forget this errand."- Woodrow WilsonA healthy woman is much like a wolfGENERAL WOLF RULES FOR LIVING1. Eat2. Rest3. Rove in between4. Render loyalty5. Love the children6. Cavil in moonlight7. Tune your ears8. Attend to the bones9. Make love10. Howl oftenClarissa Pinkola Estes, Women Who Run with the Wolves
