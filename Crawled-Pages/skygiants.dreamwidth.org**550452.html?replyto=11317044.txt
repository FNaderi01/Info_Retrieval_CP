Yeah, it's kind of fascinating to me, honestly. There's a scene where Garion uses his magic to kill somebody, and then is upset about it and worried that he's a monster for doing it, and everyone else is like "Garion, stop whining and get over yourself, sometimes you just have to do a magic murder." But at least Garion's distress implies there is something to be distressed about ... and then there's a whole lot of casual stabbing later that he just doesn't even register. (ALSO there is the part where Ce'Nedra saves the lives of some serfs by ... signing them up for the army? They're part of a pointless war machine now but at least they get to eat!)
