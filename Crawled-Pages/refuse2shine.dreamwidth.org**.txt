Thrifting FindsSep. 22nd, 2020 11:20 pm
I went to the thrift store with my sister on Sunday. It's been awhile since I went thrifting and I enjoyed the trip immensely. I ended up scooping up some really neat stuff for just over $20. ( More about what I found )

Star Trek Holidays 2020 Exchange LetterSep. 20th, 2020 10:08 pm
I don't normally write detailed letters for exchanges, but I feel in this case, it will probably be necessary. So here is my letter for the Star Trek Holidays 2020 Exchange. Please feel free to take suggestions with a grain of salt and just write something following my likes and DNWs. I just wanted to give some inspiration.( Star Trek: Picard )( Star Trek: The Next Generation )( Star Trek: The Original Series )( Star Trek: Voyager )And that's it. I know I'm not super specific with my prompts, but honestly, I'm not a picky person. I just enjoy reading good fic about characters I love.
Current Mood:   thankful

Music Letter MemeMay. 1st, 2020 04:10 pm
So I'm joining in on the music letter meme that's going around. honigfrosch gave me the letter T.My first thought was Toronto. They're a Canadian rock band from the 70s and 80s with a female lead singer which ticks off a lot of the things I love in music. They're probably most well known for their song "Your Daddy Don't Know" which is a great tune, but I'd like to share another song with you called "Girls Night Out."Watch on YouTubeIf you'd like to play along, just follow these rules in the comments:Name a BAND (NOT a song, NOT a solo performer) that starts with the letter "T" and provide a YouTube link of one of their songs.Please don’t Google one, just use your brain.I'll then give you a letter for you to REPOST

Alright, here it is. My first post as part of the Fangirl Challenge I posted yesterday. This post is part 1 of my television shows post. Here I will talk about 5 television shows I love. This part focuses solely on live action television and not animated shows (that's a separate post). I'll put each show behind a separate cut.I should mention that these are in no particular order.( Star Trek: The Next Generation )( CSI:NY )( Stranger Things )( Due South )( Pride and Prejudice )

Blood QuantumApr. 28th, 2020 07:58 am
I came across an article, shared by a friend on Facebook, about a film called Blood Quantum being released digitally here in Canada.I had not previously heard of this film, but it screened at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival and was supposed to be released theatrically, but that was cancelled due to the ongoing pandemic. Reading that article and another from 2019 about Blood Quantum has definitely piqued my interest. I'm not a huge horror fan, but I do like zombies and I am 100% here for Indigenous representation in film.

Fangirl ChallengeApr. 27th, 2020 09:43 pm
I started this challenge with photo sets on Tumblr awhile ago but never got to finishing it. Anyway, I think I’d like to do this challenge where I talk about some of these things on here and go more in depth than just with a photo set. I’ve tweaked this challenge from the original to be more representative of my fandom interests. This post will serve as the masterlist for this challenge.( Masterlist )

These were made for the monthly graphics challenge at starfleet_hq. I originally posted them in the related friend-locked community there, but I wanted to share them here as well. All the icons were made using artwork from the mobile game Star Trek: Timelines and I tried to include characters from every series.PREVIEW:  ( Who can say when the roads meet )

Starfleet HQ - Challenge 5x11: Star Trek TropesApr. 10th, 2020 01:32 pm
For the Star Trek Tropes challenge over at starfleet_hq, I decided to make two fanmixes inspired by the Dress Up Episode trope. I chose two specific Dress Up Episodes to base my fanmixes on. The first is inspired by A Fistful of Datas from TNG and the second is inspired by Our Man Bashir from DS9. ( He wore his star for all to see )( There's a man who leads a life of danger )

You Know That Show...Mar. 21st, 2020 12:30 am
There's a great page on TV Tropes called You Know That Show where people can post shows or songs or movies they half-remember. I've posted a few things on there over the years and have had some success finding out just what it was I half-remembered. However, there have been some queries that have remained a mystery.Well, tonight I managed to find one of the obscure Canadian country songs that I've been trying to find for years and let me tell you, it is the most satisfying feeling. Here's the song on YouTube if you're curious.Watch on YouTube
