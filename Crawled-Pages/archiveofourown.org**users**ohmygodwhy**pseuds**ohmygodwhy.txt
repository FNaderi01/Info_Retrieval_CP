    Summary
      “Get their asses,” Jones says, and raises his half empty milkshake in a toast.“To getting their asses,” Toni says loudly, and the rest of the serpents echo; Sweet Pea smiles, even though it’s messy and loud and the other customers are sending them Looks, feeling happy and more at home than he has since he walked through those fancy rich kid school doors. Fuck ‘em, he thinks, they’re gonna run this new school just like they ran the old one.(alternate title: the schools merge, this time with a little more basketball, pining, messy teen feelings and an "eat the rich" themed student council campaign)

    Summary
      he cooks breakfast at the andrews’ on sunday mornings; a habit from when he was living with them, sleeping on archie’s floor. it feels like so long ago, even though it’s barely been a few months. he’s flipping pancakes, archie sitting across the table, bent over his history homework, when fred hobbles his way in. (the months after fred gets shot are a lesson in balance.)

    Summary
      Sweet Pea immediately goes to claim the bed by dropping his bag and his jacket on it, but Jones says, “Dad says we have to switch off who gets the real mattress!” “Goddammit,” Sweet Pea says. “I call the first night, I fucking call it.”Jones looks him dead in the eye and says, “I think Fangs should get it the first night.” Everyone knows that everyone—obviously including Sweet Pea—has a soft spot for Fangs. What’s he gonna do, say no? (or: the one where the serpents move into the jones' new house with them because I Say So)

    Summary
      He takes the time to memorize it all: the way the wood feels under him and the way the breeze rustles the leaves above him and the sound of Jughead breathing softly beside him. He memorizes the way Jughead sounds, and the way his long sleeves bunch up below his elbows and the way his eyelashes cast a shadow. When they wake up in the morning, huddled together and a little overheated under the sleeping bags, Archie memorizes that, too. He’s never been good at remembering things like times tables and how to spell long words, but he thinks he’ll try his best to remember this for as long as he can. (growing up together, and apart, and back together again)

    Summary
      He has nothing to write. It's like the words are all stuck inside him, pushing and pushing but they just—can't get out. Like build up in a pipe. Empty bottles piled in the trash can. Empty empty empty. He has nothing important to say, nothing to wrap up The Story or keep it going, so one night he gives up and opens a new, blank document. In the document, he starts: I think there's something wrong with me. or: a ‘jughead half-way joins a gang, finds himself, makes friends, has an argument with but ultimately finds a kind-of boyfriend, too’ story in five parts

    Summary
      It would be an easy lie to say that he had gone after her out of the goodness or his heart or because it was the right thing to do. He couldn't do that though, not when she was looking at him like he was a hero from one of the songs. He did this for himself, not for her.-Theon goes to King's Landing instead of Pyke and everything changes.

    Summary
      Aizawa starts walking towards the exit, obviously expecting Shouto to follow him, but Shouto's feet are frozen in place. His eyes flicker from the distorted reflection of himself in the ice to where All Might is giving him a long look, eyes kinder than anything Todoroki has ever been deserving of, and he feels sick.“Todoroki-kun,” Midoriya says gently, squeezing his arm in what Shouto presumes is meant to be a reassuring gesture. “It’s going to be okay.”He doesn’t think Midoriya is in any place to tell him what okay is, all things considered, but he chooses to keep quiet on the matter.

    Summary
      where Robb is so pissed at everyone's show-canon!life choices that he makes a deal so he can come back to life and put things back on track, Sansa's streak of bad luck is over and Theon gets the hugging he sorely deserves.alternatively, where the author goes into pure wish fulfillment territory.
