    Summary
      College doesn't seem like the place you would find a mafia at first glance, but it turns out to be the perfect cover. Blood chilling things occur on the small island run by an Italian mob. No one would even come to think a criminal psychology professor could be anything more than that. It certainly wouldn't cross anyone's mind what dark secrets professor Williams may be hiding. Not until one of the members of his gang makes a mistake that garners the interest of the FBI.Agent McGarrett is sent to find out the truth about the organized crime taking place on the island disguised as a college student. With many secrets hiding behind both of their masks, forbidden feelings bloom.

    Summary
      A canon divergent A/B/O AU take on Season 2 and beyond. New Governor Sam Denning decides that Five-0 needs another Alpha to balance their team. He puts in a call to British Intelligence and has them send Harry Langford, who feels an immediate draw to atypical Omega Danny. What happens next turns Danny's world upside down, but is that exactly what he needs?Please keep in mind, that as this is an A/B/O AU the characters may act differently than they do in the show. I have tried to keep as many of the major plot points the same but within the dynamic of A/B/O society things, and characters' personalities, might be a bit different.Also I've turned comments off.

    Summary
      After Steve is informed of Joe White's death, he and Danny take a trip to Virginia, and once on the mainland head to the crime scene where they face off with two Federal Agencies, the BAU and NCIS neither of which are willing to back down. After Danny talks some sense, the 6 men come to the conclusion, for the victim's sake, that the two agencies plus the 5-0  task force will be working the case together, which leads to another problem.Who is going to take the lead?

    Summary
      Buona sera!Questa è la mia prima long, è una McDanno angst, c'è dell'Hurt e, diciamo, che ad uno dei nostri due boss succedono cose non proprio belle.I capitoli sono già scritti e revisionati ma ovviamente potrei apportare delle modifiche man mano. Ci saranno scene di pestaggi e vi chiedo di leggere le note capitolo per capitolo, grazie mille.Dal primo capitolo vi lascio un piccolo estratto:"Il volto assonnato di Danny si nascose nel cuscino rotolando dalla parte opposta a dove c’era Steve.-Un incubo, sei solo un fastidioso incubo Hawaiano, insieme agli ananas.-Il seal ridacchiò spostandosi dalla finestra e finendo per sdraiarsi sul letto, una mano a sorreggersi la testa mentre con l’altra andava a scuotere la spalla di Danny."

    Summary
      This is going to be a collection of mostly short McDanno moments (not necessarily following a consecutive timeline). Each of these can stand alone, some are episode related and will be tagged accordingly. A few of the later chapters are canon compliant, meaning bromance instead of romance (which will be found in the respective chapter notes).
