Before You Call the CopsMay. 30th, 2020 09:18 am
     https://twitter.com/SykesCharlie/status/1265845774153383941   I'm not shocked by all the violence and anger in Minneapolis; or that a Police Station has been burned to the ground.   I am shocked that it's taken decade upon decade of extra-judicial murders for it to get to the point where law abiding people will destroy the symbol of the people who have sworn to protect and serve, but who, too often, are little more than an occupation force.    kerk

Oogy; oogy, oogy...Mar. 25th, 2020 01:15 pm
 Feeling a little extra of the oogy today. Hopefully it's my toothache and my total lack of ibuprofen. Been taking so few over recent months I didn't realise how low my supply was. Got some rolls and a couple cartons of my Goat's Milk; mostly Mash Pots and packet soup apart from that. Fun; fun, fun. Back to watching my MASH DVDs; last disc of S5. Almost at the end of Frank Burns and almost at the much more interesting Charles Emerson Winchester III. Goddess watch over us all, kerk

Thought I'd share this check-in ideaMar. 16th, 2020 11:52 am
    https://alexcat.dreamwidth.org/1212672.html   Been a deep funk for long time now; deeper lately to the point that I sometimes find it impossible to force myself outside to even top up my gas metre; or worse, make sure that the bird feeders are filled.   It doesn't help that I have had a dry cough since before I can even remember; not back to childhood kind of thing, but certainly before I moved up to Scotland. This means I am ultra conscious of every cough; even though I spend most of my time totally alone. I know I have begun to become uncaring whether I'm talking my thoughts or ideas aloud and that is not helping me go outside.  Point being I have no bug, and for the first time in a long while I find myself not placing pressure on myself to go outside.  Anyways.  I'm here; keeping an ear out for people who are posting and such; even if I'm not responding terribly much.  I know I live too much in my head; was a problem even when I used to go to the SF club in Plymouth &amp; to Trek Cons etc; thinking this year I'll not have much choice about going to Prides in NI.  Going to have to go out soon, but there's no moral imperative stopping me panic buying as I quite literally do not have money to buy even what I should actually need to get through until my medical pension in slightly over two weeks.  I'm not struggling as I'm sure a lot of people are because my mental health has often placed me in the position of getting by on not enough for so long now that I'm often nor conscious of it.  So if you feel like talking, or sharing or whatever here, or via the post I've linked to, may be a way of letting people know that you're ok and remembering that even if we don't interact very often, we still have each other's backs.  Binge watching an awful lot of Degrassi episodes; which has a soap-opera-y way pf showing you that people can be jerks &amp; friends to each other and still stay together.  Don't be an idiot and panic buy. Don't be a Boris or a Donald. Behave responsibly and everything will, eventually, be fine.   Goddess watch over you all,  kerk

Fics for 2020 # 001 ~ "Oops, I did it again..."Jan. 1st, 2020 11:56 pm
    TITLE: ''Oops, I did it again...''      AUTHOR: kerk_hiraeth     FANDOM: Buffy the Vampire Slayer (post-series; btvs-Chosen!verse);     LENGTH: 100;     CHARACTER(s): Faith Lehane; Andrew Wells;     'SHIP(s): none;     RATING: PG;     SUMMARY: Never leave your snacks unattended when the Dark Slayer is around.     A/N: Wanted to see how fast I could do one of these; this is from the most recent dailyprompt for January 1st ~ “oops”. Not sure I can get it posted before midnight, but gonna try. This Faith, and this Andrew belong in the comtinuation; unlikely now to be continued, that matters more to me than any other that followed the end of the TV show, certainly more than the 'official' one(s). This is set in the fictional burgh of Trillium; situated at the centre of a triangle, part of which is that hellmouth in Cleveland. The continuation, called by it's creator, Jet Wolf, The Chosen captured everything about the show that I loved and gave me a new set of characters to love.         The Dweeb was turning a delightful fruity shade of purple.      Appropriate, she thought.     Brain trying furiously to counter her outrageous suggestion about Chewbacca; he was also desperately attempting to avoid mainlining pure fridge fresh soda.     Waiting until he'd turned away to snort all over the carpet; she swiftly shook something over his pizza.     Deadpan, she stared at the movie; watching him glare at her from the corner of her eye; deciding he needed to clarify his response he risked biting into a slice of his pizza.     Seconds later; his mouth on fire, she said innocently.       “You don't like Jalapeño then?”                  kerk hiraeth

Happy Holigays! aka My Xmas 2019Dec. 31st, 2019 09:20 pm
    Spent christmas with my good friend Ciaran and with Mousey, a gift from elisi; who loves Shakespeare and Emily Dickinson and A Muppet Christmas Carol, which they like despite the Rat, because Rizzo is actually a cool dude behind the scenes; also present is Maz Kanata, presented to me by John Nellies of Bits 'n' Bytes, who gave me a roof over my head when I was homeless.   They both played a part in saving my life, and still do.   As does Ciaran; whom is as good a friend as anyone could wish for.    We had two large pizzas christmas eve; Ciaran's gift, which were eventually finished late Boxing Day, and watched Die Hard and xmas episodes of Northern Exposure and Gilmore Girls; neither of which are actually about xmas :-)        Actually managed to have my first tub of Haagan-Daaz actually on Dec 25th for several years. Got to watch White Christmas actually over christmas as well for once.    kerk hiraeth   Late update; have just been delivered of a freshly made Clootie Dumpling, made by John's Mum to the recipe, or so I believe, of his Gran, who used to make me one every xmas before she passed away.

Fics for 2009 # 003 ~ The Real CabaretDec. 24th, 2019 07:54 am
    TITLE: The Real Cabaret      AUTHOR: kerk_hiraeth     FANDOM: Buffy the Vampire Slayer S3;     LENGTH: 100;     RATING: PG-13 (for language);     CHARACTER(s): Faith Lehane;     'SHIP(s): none;     SUMMARY: Faith philosophises, season three-stylee;     A/N: This was originally written for the open_on_sunday prompt, 'Candy', back in November 2009; and was, I think, only the second drabble I'd posted at that time. I remember saying that at one time I'd not foreseen ever being able to write anything that wouldn't make War and Peace look like an office memo. Seems an age...     My notes say I was on a coach back to Perth from Glasgow and wrote this in just over an NFL hour. It was inspired by a quote from Ute Lemper, used in a documentary about Weimar Berlin, about the almost suicidal gay culture that existed in Berlin as the dawn of Nazi Germany approached; which also was the story of the movie musical, Cabaret, of course.           It was like candy; a sweet sugary high; a cold, refreshing soda.     Like the man said, “dance like a butterfly.”     Fight, fuck, kill.     Sting like a bee; fuck'em, or kill'em. Strike before they do.     Her watcher's death taught her that; her most valuable lesson learnt.     Beat the Hell out of them; never let them sting you.     She'd forgot that; let that scooby gang crap suck her right in.     Nearly got her ass killed.     Kill'em; fuck'em. Party 'til dawn; leav'em gasping.     She was down with that.     Five by Five.       It was a dance on a volcano; she was already burning.                  kerk_hiraeth

Fics for 2010 # 001 ~ Hymn for Those Left Behind (Original pronouns)Dec. 19th, 2019 11:59 pm
    TITLE: Hymn for Those Left Behind      AUTHOR: kerk_hiraeth     FANDOM: Doctor Who (2005) S5;     LENGTH: 350;     CHARACTER(s): The Doctor (as portrayed by Matt Smith); Amy Pond; Rory Williams (in abstentia);     'SHIP(s): Amy/Rory;     SUMMARY: How painful is it to be the only one to remember someone else's true love?     A/N: This is the original version (in terms of pronouns) of this story; written during a time when I was attempting to write a non-fan's perspective (of the new incarnation) of Season Five as someone who grew up with the original show. That version was written at a time when few of us expected; though several of us hoped, to see a female Doctor one day.             In re-editing this I had wanted to try and reflect the fact the change in gender, but feedback from a non-binary friend has led me to decide to post this re-edit with those original pronouns.            I am aware that Amy was a kissagram; the change to strippergram is an attempt to reflect the different decisions she might have made because Rory wasn't a part of her life.          There's nothing left of him anywhere, but for a cheap ring; though not for a junior nurse on NHS wages.    He could see him in her eyes.    She never knew him; never smiled at some ludicrously uncool thing he'd done.    Had never joked about something said absent-mindedly; as the two of them walked under a tree by a stream, he would have loved.    Never punched his arm when he was particularly dense over some compliment she'd paid him.    But he can see him in her eyes.    He can see him in a momentary loss of concentration; eyes glazed over as she wondered what distracted her from some important thing that seemed to have... lost all importance.    He could see him in that way she has of seeming to turn; puzzling when someone seemed inexplicably absent from her side. Alone though the two of them were; he would see him in the way she shakes her head; turning back to continue her vibrant exposition of some piece of music; maybe a film...    … or complaint about some lousy disappointment of a boyfriend she had gone out with.       “I just wish, “ she would add; gently twisting a knife she was unaware of, “I'd met someone who mattered; someone who actually gave a damn. Most of them think; because I take my clothes off for a living, that I'm only worth a one night stand.”     Then she would sigh with resignation and, grinning, give him a gentle peck on the cheek; acceptance that The Doctor would always see her as 'their wee Amelia' – and he knew she was wishing he would see himself as so much more than her saviour from a disappointing existence.       But he could still see him in the turn of her lips; could recall him making some desperately unfunny joke that, nevertheless, had made Amy shake her head and smile.      “But you'll do, “ she'd tell him; with that cheek of a smirk on her face. “Gotta keep looking for that special numpty, huh?”     And his hearts would break just that little bit more that he thought was still possible.                kerk hiraeth        A/N: The title, and indeed this fic, were inspired by the use of this song; Hymn for Those Left Behind by Shannon Moore  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcllKUL6YRg in the LGBT movie, Latter Days http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0345551/ from 2003. The director of that movie wanted his 18-year old Mormon missionary self to meet his middle-aged out and proud self; wondering how that would go; indeed a key moment in the film has a Mormon hymn, Abide With Me, performed in the background.

Fics for 2010 # 001 ~ Hymn for Those Left BehindDec. 14th, 2019 07:39 am
    TITLE: Hymn for Those Left Behind     AUTHOR: kerk_hiraeth     FANDOM: Doctor Who (2005) S5;     LENGTH: 350;     CHARACTER(s): The Doctor (as portrayed by Matt Smith); Amy Pond; Rory Williams (in abstentia);     'SHIP(s): Amy/Rory;     SUMMARY: How painful is it to be the only one to remember someone else's true love?     A/N: The original version of this story was written during a time when I was attempting to write a non-fan's perspective (of the new incarnation) of Season Five as someone who grew up with the original show. That version was written at a time when few of us expected; though several of us hoped, to see a female Doctor one day.             In re-editing this I wanted to try and reflect the fact that hope had finally come to fruition; thus a change has been attempted from he/him to they/them and not just to she/her. I hope that I've managed this effectively, though I've yet to decide whether to continue this when I try to write my own version of a female Doctor.           Back when Sylvester McCoy was playing The Doctor I began mulling over the idea of writing an alternative to The Doctor; that idea was re-awakened, with the image that my Doctor was going to be played (at least in my head) by a woman. That thought had actually began before even the TV movie came about, but was added to when River Song was, in one episode of Season Six a young black woman. Thus when I do write those stories the image I have in my head will be of Nina Sosanya; not Jodie Whittaker.          Also, before someone makes the comment, I am aware that Amy was a kissagram; the change to strippergram is an attempt to reflect the different decisions she might have made because Rory wasn't a part of her life.          There's nothing left of him anywhere, but for a cheap ring; though not for a junior nurse on NHS wages.    They could see him in her eyes.    She never knew him; never smiled at some ludicrously uncool thing he'd done.    Had never joked about something said absent-mindedly; as the two of them walked under a tree by a stream, he would have loved.    Never punched his arm when he was particularly dense over some compliment she'd paid him.    But they can see him in her eyes.    They can see him in a momentary loss of concentration; eyes glazed over as she wondered what distracted her from some important thing that seemed to have... lost all importance.    They could see him in that way she has of seeming to turn; puzzling when someone seemed inexplicably absent from her side.

G'Kar speaks for me.Dec. 11th, 2019 10:02 pm
 I have never been so depressed going in to an election day. Even if the Remain parties &amp; Labour do better than I expect this doesn't feel like my country anymore.For the second election in a row I will be forced to vote against something in order to, hopefully, keep a party from winning this constituency and if I'm still here if, or when, a second independence referendum comes I do not see myself voting to stay in the UK.I just wish I had the means to leave.We are throwing our freedom in the trash piece by piece.Did all those people who gave their lives for the right to vote really do it for this? "No dictator, no invader, can hold an imprisoned population by the force of arms forever. There is no greater power in the universe than the need for freedom. Against that power governments, and tyrants, and armies can not stand. .................. .................... Though it take a thousand years, we will be free." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJmuHNDcXLQ&amp;t=214s G'Kar; Babylon 5, S02E20 'The Long, Twilight Struggle' kerk hiraeth

Fics from 2014/5 ~ Three for open on sunday (PG-13); one for femslash100 (R)Dec. 6th, 2019 10:18 pm
    In readying The Dance of the Happy Little Toaster https://archiveofourown.org/works/21695866  for inclusion on A03 I have been reminded of other stories that are connected to that one scene; Willow telling Tara she is with the one she loves, and Tara blowing out the candle. I wanted to put all those stories in one post as they will be included, or linked to other series/verses eventually and I really wanted to have them together in one post.   Latterly I will also post them separately, but this will serve as a small collected post for the extra fics. The dreamwidth post is here https://kerk-hiraeth.dreamwidth.org/3690.html for The Dance of the Happy Little Toaster. It should be noted that in all my depictions Willow is bisexual; Tara lesbian. Not that that matters as such; since I haven't yet found a way of exploring that.      This is a trio of drabbles; re-edited, but originally written for the open_on_sunday prompt, (un)dress back in 2014. They all come under the theme of first times and are set in reverse order of occurrence.  The first is firmly set in my femalehusband!verse; the second, while after the conclusion of 'New Moon Rising' is also; per my head canon also set in that 'verse; this is also true of the third which is pre-series for Tara's arrival on Buffy.        TITLE: Eagles on the Wind      AUTHOR: kerk_hiraeth     FANDOM: Buffy the Vampire Slayer (post-series; femalehusband!verse);     LENGTH: 100;     CHARACTER(s): Faith Lehane; Tara Maclay;     'SHIP(s): Faith/Tara;     RATING: PG-13;     SUMMARY: On their wedding night, Faith experiences Tara's true magic for the first time.     A/N: Both characters are in their thirties when this occurs; in a 'verse that diverges from canon in S6.          “Aren't we gonna screw?”    Tara tutted at Faith; slowly undoing the buttons on her new wife's dress.    “Didn't I promise you a special gift?”    “Yeah, but...”    Surrendering with a sigh, Faith began assisting in her disrobement; unable to hide her confusion. After all she'd walked in to find her Tara nude on the bed; dress and underwear strewn across the room.    Hard not to make assumptions really; though she should have considered Tara's wicked sense of humor.    Both naked they kissed.    Tara put a halt to anything more; well tried anyway.      Minutes later they were flying; Eagles on the wind.      TITLE: Gentle as a Desert Spring     AUTHOR: kerk_hiraeth     FANDOM: Buffy the Vampire Slayer S4 (post-New Moon Rising);     LENGTH: 100;     CHARACTER(s): Tara Maclay; Willow Rosenberg;     SHIP(s): Willow/Tara (willtara);     RATING: PG-13;     SUMMARY: Tara's pov on the moments after she blew out the candle at the conclusion of 'New Moon Rising'.     A/N: Tara's journey; following on from the drabble below, toward the future seen in the one above; taken as a snapshot of her first night, as a lover, with Willow.       It was Tara that broke their kiss; before Willow fainted.     She could tell Willow wasn't entirely happy about that, but she wanted this to be good; better than good.    Plenty of time for the ripping of bodices.    This was Willow's first time; with a girl anyway.    Gently was what Tara wanted; as hers had been.    Her first with a woman anyway.    “Tara...”    Softly praying to the Goddess, Tara leant in to kiss Willow gently on the lips.    “Now,” she whispered, with a mischievous smile,  “let's slip out of something more uncomfortable.”      She delighted as Willow blushed; redder than her hair.       TITLE: The First Time     AUTHOR: kerk_hiraeth     FANDOM: Buffy the Vampire Slayer (circa S3);     LENGTH: 100;     CHARACTER(s): Tara Maclay; OC, ( Jan(an) al-Bukhari);     'SHIP(s): Tara/oc / Tara/Jan(an);     RATING: PG-13;     SUMMARY: What was Tara's first time like?     A/N: This is set on Tara's eighteenth birthday; two years prior to the conclusion of 'Family'. Tara's Girlfriend here is approximately five years her senior and will appear in other 'verses over time. She is Arab-American; her parents arriving as refugees when she was still a baby.         “Tara... come here,”    Less than five hours eighteen Tara; having known only fear; pain and tears, found the feelings she'd had toward girls; all her life, were very real.    “Janan... I don't know what...”    Not born from previous torment.    Betrayed by her nervousness; still coming back from their lovemaking; uncertain in these unnavigated waters, her Girlfriend's voice gave her a compass.    “Jan, please. I...”    The Arab girl responded eagerly to the sudden; decisive, kiss from Tara; newly certain of who she was; what she wanted.    “I want to use your name as often as I can...     I love your name. “      Oo-kay, so this is probably the single scariest fic I have written to date depicting, as it does, a sexual encounter between two women to fill a prompt requested by a bona fide lesbian. Not the first lesbian scene I'd written; but this was for someone. The original is from 2015, and is set a while after the one above written in 2014 for open_on_sunday; The Dance of the Happy Little Toaster is set the following morning.         TITLE: Cresting the Wave     AUTHOR: kerk_hiraeth     FANDOM: Buffy the Vampire Slayer S4;     LENGTH: 100;     RATING: R;     CHARACTER(s): Willow Rosenberg; Tara Maclay;     'SHIP(s): Willow/Tara (willtara);     SUMMARY: Tara introduces Willow to experiences she was not yet aware of.     A/N: The original prompt was ~ Tara/Willow – Rimming ~ for drabbletag6 at femslash100 (sadly the comm does not seem to have been updated for some time), for which said prompter declared herself well pleased and made some very kind comments. Because it was most definitely outside my comfort zone it is stiil on of those of which I am proudest. Though erotic; rather than explicit, it is still very much a nerve-wracker to be putting out there again.         Whatever Willow had expected from tonight, it wasn't this.    Gasping at the magical chill, she sighed as it was replaced by a warm; probing, dampness which slowly set a musky; moist, warmth aflame within her.    Minute at first; pressure built, curious; sensuous, teasing.    Seeking for her key.    Heat; mind fuzzy, a viscid wetness; intense, past even where she'd been before.    Willow; brain sharply unfocussed, bit the crest of the wave into the pillow.    Fingers; one wetter than the rest, stroked her back to lucidity.    Tara raised her chin from where she was nuzzling Willow's ass.      “Now the fun really starts.”             kerk hiraeth

I feel like if I once start; i'll never stop crying. D.C. Fontana (1939-2019) R.I.P.Dec. 4th, 2019 05:24 pm
   It feels like the Star Trek I loved is dying around me.   D.C. Fontana has gone.   Far too many obituaries and tributes to even begin posting but this from twitter says everything really; plus my own comments made to friend earlier today. ~  Probably one of the biggest influences on my writing; what I read and what I watch and I didn't realise just how much.  https://twitter.com/JacksonLanzi…/status/1201927437069586432“Stories about objects don't work. Stories about relationships do. Focus on telling stories about the characters. Do your best. Do it from the heart.”D.C. Fontana was, is, and always shall be my North Star for Star Trek. I have a million things I’d like to say but for now: RIP. I wish I was at an old fan-run Trek con in the midst of a massive; tear-filled group hug, or with the old USS Drake crowd in Plymouth back when the news came through that Pat Troughton had died.  I just want the bad news to take a day off.  PLEASE.

Fics for 2019 # 004 ~ Ikh gefunen ir / I have found her / איך געפונען אירNov. 30th, 2019 02:51 am
     TITLE: Ikh gefunen ir (I have found her)    AUTHOR: kerk_hiraeth      FANDOM: Babylon 5 (post-series);      LENGTH: 200;      CHARACTER(s): Susan Ivanova; OC (Karen Karen); Michael Garibaldi (mention of);      SHIP(s): Ivanova/OC; Talia Winters/Susan Ivanova (by implication from canon);      SUMMARY: You never forget your first true love.      A/N: The fic posted here is the final version of one I have been working on, in one way or another for something like seven years; about the time I finally watched all the episodes of Babylon 5.              The first versions were all about a drabble's length, but not one really worked. A character kept on creeping in and spoiling them. Once I listened to that insistence she be a part of this story I eventually reached the first version close to what you see here. From there it still took a seemingly interminable amount of months, to figure out what was wrong with the ending (see the end notes for how that resolved itself).             After that my mental health problems almost finished any prospect of me writing again.            However, now she is finally ready to fly.            No sooner had Fleet Capt. Susan Andreievna Ivanova sat down to her long delayed breakfast than the message arrived.    Lt. Cmdr Karen Karen gently pressed her; as she was wont to say, ass back down; then kissed her lover with uncharacteristic forcefulness. Smiling at Ivanova's; equally uncharacteristic, confusion she explained, “I wanted to make sure you came back, “ pressing; as she did so, a folded piece of paper into her superior's palm.    Standing, Ivanova's exec added; with an almost Russian air of fatalism, “Our assigned patrols are completed; course is set. We can have you at Earth-Mars in nine days... assuming you don't want to stop over at your old command.”    Turning from studying Karen's departing... back; she was Captain of this vessel when Ivanova's rank took her off-ship, she pointedly studied the commissary.    Said commissary; full of crew frozen amidst meal and conversation, interrupted by the unusually public affection between the two senior officers aboard ship, suddenly became animated with noisy banging; chatter and remembered elsewheres to be.    Satisfied, Ivanova read the message; dated almost a month previous. Michael Garibaldi's communication explained her... Karen's sudden, and unprofessional, lack of decorum.      Bei mir bistu schein      He had found Talia.             kerk hiraeth         Went looking for russian nomenclature as I was misremembering Ivanova as having a fuller name, which led me here http://faculty.virginia.edu/herman/tolstoy/namingconventions.htm and since her father was named Andrei and -evna scans better that gave me her patronymic.       Her exec/partner/lover's name is an anglicised, and here I had to cut the references to Fed Standard English version of what her name would be in actuality. Her first name is common enough across several cultures; but her last name would be Kayin, in reference to her ancestry from the south-east of what we call Burna, or Myanmar (both are correct; Myanmar being apparently a more formal version of Burma; not the replacement).       The title ( yiddish; Ikh gefunen ir / english; I have found her) yiddish in hebrew script; איך געפונען איר ); which made up the gist of the original ending, eventually got replaced by the title of the original yiddish version of a song I knew principally from versions by The Andrews Sisters which, along with several other versions, would just not let me go.       If you're unfamiliar with Babylon 5; these links will give you a feeling for the characters mentioned; except for my original character of course. I already have ideas for further scenes/stories in my head, but I do feel the need to get a little deeper into her possible cultural history https://babylon5.fandom.com/wiki/Susan_Ivanova  https://babylon5.fandom.com/wiki/Talia_Winters  https://babylon5.fandom.com/wiki/Michael_Garibaldi

Fics for 2019 # 003 ~ FootprintsNov. 25th, 2019 01:00 am
   TITLE: Footprints      AUTHOR: kerk_hiraeth    FANDOM: Buffy the Vampire Slayer S1; S6 onward;     LENGTH: 250;    RATING: PG (mention of character death);    CHARACTER(s): Rupert Giles; Jesse (Williams);    SHIP(s): None;    SUMMARY: ''Some people come into our lives and leave footprints on our hearts and we are never ever the same.'' Flavia Weedn (1929-2015);    A/N: Until the quote turned up on a wordpress I follow I'd never heard of Flavia Weedn; still can't find out much about her, but the quote didn't take long to inspire this fic, which I actually started writing about the same time I was working on my second Nancy!verse story. Jesse is a character that has always stuck with me. Handful of scenes; killed off in the second half of the pilot and only ever mentioned in fanfic or meta he nevertheless has been in the back of my mind ever since I first saw those opening episodes; sometime between watching the first half of S4 and waiting for the second half to come back into the library. After some re-working; mostly on how Jesse's words (the error is deliberate), and the ending were to be presented, and here we are.           Harvest averted; Slayer and her friends gone, Rupert Giles locked his diary notes away and reached to turn off his desk light; disturbing a piece of paper which fluttered to the floor.    Reaching down in case it was important he was brought up short by the scrawl; realising quickly that it had been meant for his predecessor as Librarian.     'Mr. Bennett, (here there was a hole) the book. I did find it, as I said I did (another hole; so erased it was torn) ther's (then) my next visit (another hole) Mom says I can't do it after school, but I can do chores to pay the fine.    Deciphering the signature took longer, but read, Jesse Williams.     ~   Years later he could still talk about the note at the funeral of Jesse's mother.   People were impressed that he would travel all the way from England for the parent of a pupil he had never actually met.   He never told them that.   He made a point; after that note, of attending every funeral he could of a parent whose child he had failed to save.   Everyone of them left a footprint; however brief. Every one of them had had people who never knew why the hole in the paper of their lives was so completely erased.   Every one of his children had holes in their lives he could not repair.   Sometimes you had to accept that; find a sticking plaster, and hope that was enough.       Sometimes the footprints were just washed away.                kerk hiraeth

Fics for 2019 # 002 ~ Love is patient; Love is kindNov. 23rd, 2019 09:20 pm
     TITLE: Love is patient; Love is kind  AUTHOR: kerk_hiraeth  FANDOM: Degrassi Next Class (post-series);  LENGTH: 400;  RATING: G;  CHARACTER(s) Rasha Zuabi; Zoë Rivas;  'SHIP(s): Zoë Rivas/Rasha Zuabi;  SUMMARY: Where do you find the words that can explain to your still conservatively liberal Muslim mother that the woman their daughter will marry is the right one for their child, and are they really okay with who you are now?  A/N: Inspired by Mary Lambert's beautiful song, 'She Keeps Me Warm', this is set several years in our future; Next Class sadly seeming likely to have concluded the Degrassi saga for the foreseeable future; due to Netflix' corporate callousness, with S4.  This is told entirely from Rasha's pov; intention being to write a contiguous story from Zoë's pov. Rasha arrived at Degrassi as a refugee from the conflict(s) in Syria at the start of S3; whilst Zoë arrived there at the start of Degrassi: Next Generation's S12 (TNG had far longer seasons which covered similar periods of time; as far as I can tell, as two of NC's ten episode seasons).  Zoë came out as lesbian in the S2 finale of NC; though was still in the process, publically, when Rasha arrives at Degrassi. She is raised Catholic by a very homophobic mother; whereas Rasha is Muslim and had been outed while still living in Aleppo (it was never made clear if this was a primary reason for her family escaping from the rule of ISIS (the term used on the show), though it is stated that it was only when they took over that she was forced to wear the hijab. She does not come out to the daughter of her hosts until the finale of S3; by which time she is in a relationship with Zoë, though it is implied they have yet to become sexual at that point.      First chance she could get Rasha was on a flight to Beirut; as close to home as she was likely ever to get again. It was hard now to recapture when Aleppo was home.  Home was Vancouver and, Zoë.  She understood why the daughter needed to tell her mother in person and Rasha knew Zoë would wait for as long as it took to get married; so that Rasha could have her family; those who accepted her, beside her at the ceremonies. It broke Rasha's heart that Zoë would never have that.  Rasha could almost feel her mother's arms; never thought at one time she would feel that childhood warmth and safety again. She could see them; held aloft, only a couple of security checks away; wanted to fly to them.  Handing her papers and brand new Canadian passport to her Zoe hadn't even asked Why. Of all people Zoë had understood the why and the need.  Time was; with all her past celebrity and notoriety, that Zoë might have paid for this trip. Now Rasha was breadwinner; she didn't want to contemplate that her love might never have come out.  She whispered Allah's blessings on the family who had hosted her when she got to Canada for their generosity in paying for these flights. She knew her mother would understand the love and strength that she and Zoë had gained from each other, and their friends; understand too that they were married in all but name, but only until she was by her daughter's side.  And she knew her mother would love and accept her new daughter; accepting her as her own had rejected her.  She just needed to see it in her mother's eyes; feel the enveloping acceptance of those arms she had thought lost to her.  Then she saw the smile; achingly close to tears, could repeat in unison with her mother the thanks to Allah they were both safe.  Seeing her mother so achingly close; softly saying the prayer together, gave Rasha the words she needed that said everything her mother needed to hear from her; all she'd need Rasha now knew.  She'd felt them when Zoë had simply held her as Rasha asked to be her wife.  On the same steps where she first saw her love she had spoken them; misunderstanding a never spoken question.   They could not be perfected.    “She keeps me warm.”       ~  'She Keeps Me Warm by Mary Lambert'    a) This is from one piece about the song ~ The song, which is based on Lambert's own personal experience of growing up as a lesbian and trying to reconcile her life as a homosexual with her Christian faith, basically talks about the struggles of homosexuals.  https://www.songmeaningsandfacts.com/meaning-song-keeps-warm-mary-lambert/  b) The most relevant lyrics to this story are the opening lines of the first verse and the chorus ~  She says I smell like safety and home  I named both of her eyes forever and please don't go    Ch: And I can't change, even if I  tried  Even if I wanted to  And I can't change, even if I tried  Even if I wanted to  My love, my love, my love  She keeps me warm, she keep me warm  and c) The lyrics over the end of the song inspired the story as a whole; particularly Rasha finding in them the words she needs for both her wife-to-be, and her mother whom she last saw when they were separated escaping Syria. ~  I'm not crying on Sundays, (Love is patient, love is kind)  I'm not crying on Sundays, (Love is patient, love is kind)  I'm not crying on Sundays, (Love is patient, love is kind)  No, (Love is patient, love is kind)  (Love is patient, love is kind)  (Love is patient, love is kind)  (Love is patient, love is kind)  (Love is patient, love is kind)    My love, my love, my love, my love  She keeps me warm, she keeps me warm https://songmeanings.com/songs/view/3530822107859467274/     kerk hiraeth

Fics for 2019 # 001 ~ 'Til Death Do Us DieNov. 13th, 2019 05:08 am
    Okay,              so this was written way back in January and, after what has been; even for me, an excessively difficult year I have had to accept that I am never going to be able to get it looking right. I cannot use html and dreamwidth will not let me use rich text as I would wish.     Until I was typing this out again I did not realise the appropriateness of now trying again to post this; which you will understand if you read, at this time.     My eternal gratitude to the inestimable elisi, without whose support I might not be here posting this. This is the first of five very different fics I wrote back at the beginning of the year; various others are at different stages and may get posted before the year is out.          TITLE: 'Til Death Do Us Die       AUTHOR: kerk_hiraeth       FANDOM: Buffy the Vampire Slayer (S6);       LENGTH: 200;       CHARACTER(s): Spike; mentions of (in order) Angel(us); Darla; Dru(silla) &amp; Buffy Summers;       'SHIPS: Spike/Buffy; Spike/Dru; Angel(us)/Darla; Angel/Buffy;       A/N: Spike in contemplative; slightly inebriated and bitterly self-pitying, probably after another empty encounter with the re-animated, and depressed, Buffy.              Always been my head canon as to where Spike was when the Armistice was announced; especially since reading a fanfic (long since sadly lost as far as I can tell) which told of Darla in Sarajevo in June of 1914; deciding not to eat a manic Serbian terrorist, because she had a vision of the chaos his shot that rang around the world would cause.             If anyone recognises that fic and can send it me I would be so happy as I don't believe I ever printed it up.           He'd wondered aloud once; twat that he was, whether being bitten by women was why they; group they, were so different from the other Vampires he'd met.    Only time the great pouffe had called him a poof.     Still did sometimes, wonder; now he was banging the Slayer.    Plural.    Chuckling, he chugged back a beer; reminded him of that grand Belgian stuff got him plastered back in November of '18.    He was still Spike; not William the Bloody Awful Poet, who could quote every verse he'd composed in over a century of not writing them.    Angelus had been an artist in his own way; Darla too.    Not even Dru had been in his class though; all too tactile; even Dru, to appreciate his abstract nature; buried deep as it was.    Never explained why Angelus had been so willing to play pussy whipped by a woman whose intelligence could have turned them all inside out.    Never seemed the type.    Then he'd gone ass over tit for the Slayer.    It was clear to him then why Angel would still die for Darla; why, if it came to it he ~ they'd both die for Buffy.    Abandon her too.    For Dru; his Ripe; Bloody Queen.            'What is the Jay more precious than the Lark       Because his feathers are more beautiful?       Or is the Adder better than the Eel       Because his painted skin contents the eye?       O, no good Kate! Neither art thou the worse       For this poor furniture and mean array.'         ~ This is part of a speech from Act IV, Scene III of William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew. The pocket-sized book collection I own entitles it 'The Mind Enriches', but it's the second that catches my mind's attention and inspires Spike's alcohol-fueled train of thought here.       That and this passage from an early Star Trek novelisation; back when some could compete with the best science-fiction around back then.        “ 'Mnhei'sahe, ' “ she (Lt. Janice Kerasus) said promptly. “Captain, I'm sorry, but you would ask me to render one of the most difficult words in the language (Rihannsu, or what the unimaginative PTB at Paramount insist on calling Romulan). It's not quite honor – and not quite loyalty – and not quite anger, or hatred, or about fifty other things. It can be a form of hatred that requires you to give your last drop of water to a thirsty enemy – or an act of love that requires you to kill a friend. The meaning changes constantly with context, and even in one given context, it's slippery at best.”            (Ch. 10; My Enemy, My Ally by Diane Duane, 1984)              kerk_hiraeth

Fics for 2018 # 006 ~ First Love; Hello... GoodbyeDec. 25th, 2018 02:38 am
    TITLE: First Love; Hello... Goodbye       AUTHOR: kerk_hiraeth     FANDOM: Degrassi: The Next Generation (post-S12 for Fiona; S14 for Imogen);     LENGTH: 250;     CHARACTER(S): Fiona Coyne; Imogen Moreno; Laura Coyne; OC;     A/N: This was written to fill a prompt @  femslash100 ~ Any: Any/Any - parting is such sweet sorrow for doctorkaitlyn (which is also a reminder that I have to do something to get overmy embarrasment at my phobia about forms and accept offered help; thus enabling me to move stories onto kerk_hiraeth ).             I have no idea whether they are a fan of Degrassi though, being from Ontario, I Imagine they are aware of it. I have been aware of the show since news, probably, of it's re-incarnation; named above, being on the way.            Fiona and Imogen weren't even the first couple that attracted my attention, though Fiona Coyne; involved at the time of the scene I first saw in a domestic abuse and alcoholism storyline, was the first named character I ever saw (I didn't know at the time she was also coming out).           Can't recall whether it was while looking for Zoe/Rasha videos or, more likely, Adam/Becky ones, but the first Fiona/Imogen vid I saw was of their break up. I do know that from the moment I saw the request I had the image of that break up, and the expression on the characters faces; quite vivid in my mind. At first I struggled to capture it, until I realised I was writing from the wrong character's perspective; once that was corrected the story was written very quickly.              Imogen Moreno slipped quietly into a pew; eyes catching those of the Mother of her first love as she led her daughter down the aisle.      Fiona Coyne; soon to be Chang, could only see the woman she was here to wed. Imogen glanced down, not quite feeling that sweet sorrow, but certainly a bittersweet sense memory of when those eyes had looked at her that way; taking in, as her own were at the same moment, the face she might never see again.      Ironic that it had been she who was hard to track down; Fiona who was settling down in one place; albeit to a French speaking veteran, and newly Canadian, very mixed race, mother of a model Fiona had dressed for a small movie role.      Pure chance that had led her to take a date to the only movie theater in Ohio that was showing that film, so she could see what everyone else probably thought was a very cryptic message in the end titles.      One ditched date; two taxis, a plane and a train later and she was here; having called, as it turned out Fiona's Mom, just in time to see her first love marry another.      As she watched Fiona share her vows with her new wife, Imogen felt pangs, but no regrets; her decision back then had been the right one. She smiled; so much catching up; tearful joy and sweet sorrow at another, hopefully less permanent, parting, to do.      Until then...       JULIET      Sweet, so would I. Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing. Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow.       William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet; Act Two, Scene Two.       kerk hiraeth

Fics for 2018 # 005 ~ She Used To Be MineDec. 21st, 2018 03:02 pm
    TITLE: She Used To Be Mine      AUTHOR: kerk_hiraeth     FANDOM: Buffy the Vampire Slayer (FemaleHusband!verse)     LENGTH: 100;     CHARACTER(S): Tara Maclay; Willow Rosenberg (deceased, and by implication only);     A/N: This 'verse first diversifies from canon about the time of the events of OMWF thru Wrecked in S6. This is set some time after Tara, not Willow, has turned Sunnydale into a lake to destroy an ultimate evil; more than one year in time after the similar destruction happened in canon. Faith is on walkabout; on an Indian motorcycle, and Tara's safety is in the hands of another.            If you listen to the song ( www.youtube.com/watch She Used To Be Mine by Sara Bareilles) this could be read more than one way; I'm not certain whether the 'she' is Willow, or Tara herself. The 'man' in the lyrics is her father either way; not in a good way.             Tara listened blissfully; Willow brushing her hair.      Trying hard to recall her chatter; all that reached her was the laughter behind that twisted smirk.        She faced the mirror; didn't need to see that face.      Oil slick eyes; dark hair that slithered; cracked veins crawling over a face she used to know so well.        Willow's venom filled her ears; tweezers worked to remove glass; pain beat back the noiseless misery, and she barely left any scars now.      They would believe she'd shattered another tumbler.        Done, her eyes opened; herself staring back.      Looking down she wondered where she'd hidden the bottle today.      "She is gone, but she used to be mine,"     kerk hiraeth

Fics for 2018 # 004 ~ Ophelia; She is NotDec. 11th, 2018 10:06 pm
    TITLE: Ophelia; She is Not       AUTHOR: kerk_hiraeth     FANDOM: Buffy the Vampire Slayer (au-from The Harvest onward)     CHARACTER(S): Nancy (from The Wish); Buffy Summers; Cordelia Chase; Rupert Giles;     LENGTH:  1,800;     A/N: This 'verse comes out of the discussions in the comments for kerk-hiraeth.dreamwidth.org/3131.html   the second one since my 'comeback' to writing fanfic, with yourlibrarian          I was really set to thinking as to the history of the show, and how it might differ if, as in this 'verse, it was Willow who was vamped and killed in the pilot.          Those thoughts led me to Nancy. Nancy who? Well I have given her a surname; and have sketched out enough of a backstory in my head to carry more stories forward but this buffy.fandom.com/wiki/Nancy_(Wishverse says all you need to know vis-a-vis the canon of the TV show, though in my head she's a college student, with an interest in theater  ; she's also gay, which leads me to the girlfriend.         Jan, or Janan, to give her her full given name has appeared in one of my stories before. She was Tara's first girlfriend and, though it wasn't ever stated in this drabble open-on-sunday.livejournal.com/2913192.html ; one of a set of three for open-on-sunday,  was much older than Tara at the time; as Nancy would have been when they were together before this story is set.        I hope to see Nancy and Jan again, but it occurs to me now that, even when I was writing Nancy's moments in my mind; Jan was her girlfriend, and she was the same Jan as in the drabble.          The dodgy lighting over the theater parking was the same; one light had been fixed since last semester, that was it. The air was crisper; though not even close to the weather she'd grown up with, still strangers to California got a brisk shock when they experienced it. Traffic was lighter than most expected for a town this size; but the docks sounded lively; must be a couple of ships in. Nancy felt strange about it tonight that's all; first rehearsal for a production since... She grimaced; she'd gone and wasn't coming back. She sighed, reflecting that now she was starting her final year; strangeness walked hand in hand with Sunnydale every night.She couldn't fault Jan for leaving after... After it happened. She had no warning of Sunnydale's rep before she arrived; Nancy remembered Jan being so shocked that she had come to UCSD even knowing about it she'd been rendered speechless for the rest of what had turned into their first night together.Hadn't been planned as their first date, and Jan had made it clear enough over the months that learning about this town had not affected her decision to begin sleeping with her, but Nancy had always wondered.Jan had nearly finished her Freshman Year when she'd been... it had happened. Nancy cursed Greyhound for it's timetabling, but she'd known; with increasing certainty that the moment her remaining projects were completed Jan would be heading somewhere safer.It had started as a tiny humorous thing; this ritual, but it had quickly become part of their nights rehearsing at the local theater for the local drama group's productions. Jan had grasped onto it; Nancy now saw, as a way of controlling her fear.Her last year here; Nancy had rather it had been 'The Winter's Tale', but this would do ~ if only this had not been Jan's favourite, and if Cordelia had not been the part that Jan would have been perfect for.She wondered if she'd have got to play The Fool anyway; boyish as she looked at times, but she liked Cordelia anyway. She did ponder what it would be like to play Gloucester, or even maybe Lear. But Cordelia would do. So she settled her books and notes into the crook of her other arm; lifting her left to the sky to declaim. “Hark! Hark! The lark at heaven's gate sings, And Phoebus 'gins arise; His steeds... “ And there it ended as she was unceremoniously shoved aside by a pair of giggling high school rich... divas. Ironically, she supposed, one of them appeared to be Cordelia. Nancy didn't recognise the asian girl with her, but the not so surruptitious glance backward told Nancy that the moment had been deliberate. Actually it surprised her, because she knew that Chase had become part of the production team on the recommendation of one of the teachers; Nancy knew her and respected her, the woman had given up on a theatrical career of her own because of racism on Broadway; deciding on a career she loved better anyway.She didn't have to work hard to figure why she'd been targeted; for once not because she was a lesbian.She smirked; kinda refreshing that actually.Sighing she began to turn to pick up her belongings when she was almost knocked onto her backside by another; this time clearly accidental, collision. As she collected her wits, Nancy thought she heard a mumbled apology and almost clashed heads with the, apparently, extremely nervous girl flapping about in front of her; Nancy having, by this time, knelt down to assist in the recovery of her own belongings.Gripping a hard wooden object she suddenly recognised who it was. “Buffy Summers,” she said calmly, but so appreciatively that the poor girl actually stopped wrecking Nancy's notes and looked directly at her; admittedly confused until Nancy pointed out where she knew Buffy from.“Last semester? You rescued my girl... “Choking off that sentence, Nancy smiled; with only the slightest of grimaces, as she inwardly berated herself for, once more, forgetting that Jan was gone; never to return to Sunnydale.  She knew the letter waiting to be opened in her room told her where Jan was spending the rest of her college life.In a different City; different State? Different country.Anyone speculating on different continent, would not be crazy to lay money on. She thought she almost detected a moment's relaxation; only to be distracted by the object she realised she was holding. It smelt of ash, and a little blood; wasn't sharpened of course, and appeared to be made of the same wood as the chairs the cast used between scenes.Bemused, Nancy watched Buffy pick up; calmer and steadier now, her books and notes; gather them together neatly and hold them out to her. Nancy stood confused for a second, and then held the makeshift stake out to the Slayer. Fuck, but she was even tinier up close!  From somewhere Nancy's personality kicked in and she smiled. “Fair exchange?”It was Buffy's turn to be confused again; especially when Nancy held out her hand; her left hand, and it took her a couple of seconds to respond and take hold of it as they shook hands; Buffy remembering at the last moment to move the stake to her other hand.“Nancy Walker, “ she said, feeling it unusally necessary to explain; unintentionally repeating herself as she did so, that Buffy had, “... saved my... “She cursed, in arabic; which didn't help, as she kicked herself for... She was gone; Walker it's time you got used to it. She was never the u-hauling romantic, but Nancy knew she had almost begun to imagine a future with this one. She was rescued from further maudlin reflections when Buffy's head dropped and she mumbled ~ damn she was so small, “I'm sorry.”Nancy's chuckle made Buffy glance up again. “For what? Saving her? She's still alive, and I can hardly fault her for leaving a town with the rep this one has; now can I?” Nancy thought Buffy looked a bit nonplussed at that; suddenly it occurred that the poor girl wasn't used to people actually having conversation with her; talking to her.As that thought formed; another more disturbing one beat it to her vocal chords.The beads of sweat; the still heavy breaths and the biting of the lip. “You're scared... was there a vampire on the crew?”Buffy didn't have to answer, though she held up two fingers, “Scheisse!”Suddenly Jan's frantic messages; that scared timbre to her voice when they spoke after Nancy called to let her know that the bus was finally getting into Sunnydale and to meet her at College, the way she'd had to be calmed down and didn't appear to be all there when they made love.Her constant trips to the bathroom. How could I have been so obtuse?  Aloud, she muttered, “I was too horny to see straight!” A titter from nearby brought her back to the present. She saw this tiny child, but was saved from sudden anger by that grin, and laughed herself as she realised that she had, indeed, said that last out loud.Nancy looked at her and abruptly offered to buy her a coffee at the bus station if she'd escort her there. Buffy looked like she was about to refuse, then shrugged, muttering absent-mindedly that she would, and would miss working at the theater now her mission was over.“Why leave? “ Adding, before the Slayer could point out what, she imagined anyway, was obvious, “You really are good with your hands.. you turned a piece of chair leg into a weapon with... what? Your fingernails? That blood is yours, yeah?” Buffy seemed to relax a bit; telling Nancy about her friend Xander; who'd passed on tips, apparently from some alcoholic relative, so she wouldn't seem too out of place working on the sets. “You still seem lonely, if I can say that. Do you only have... “ She needed to choose her words carefully; almost having forgotten how to talk to a girl she wasn't trying to seduce. “Boys in your life?” Buffy tried not look too regretful, but it was clear she had no girlfriends. She seemed about to say there was one, but thought better of it; bit her lip and, eventually, admitted, “I could use a girlfriend.” Nancy almost doubled over in silent mirth as Buffy almost seemed to turn the colour of the Sunnydale sports jerseys as she realised what she'd said.Nancy held up her hand, “Small 'g' is fine; been a while, but I think I can recall how to talk to, “ she gestured the appropriate apostrophes; promising to kick herself later for using them, “ 'straight' girls,”The kid actually laughed at that and gestured towards the parking exit on the bus station side of the building. Nancy mocked the swooping of a hat; inappropriately as Buffy was the 'hero', but what the heck.It was actually kinda nice to play the romantic hero to a girl for once.Maybe she would try for the male lead next time after all, she smiled to herself. “He sounds like a good teacher, “ she was saying to Buffy as they turned onto the sidewalk, and waited patiently for the lights to allow them to cross. Now, if you were following the two young women ~ at a discreet, and stealthy, distance ~ you might have been expected to miss the knowing smile on the younger ones face at that remark.If that same smile, and the thought behind it hadn't also been on your mind.You might also have missed the pain on the face of the watcher as they recalled the misery at the death of an even younger girl, because of your; not your charge's, mistake.You might also have been wondering what to do about the two earnest, and dangerously heroic young people trying to assuage their own survivor's guilt by helping you and your charge; two tragically ill-equipped; angry, very young men to be, who felt far too much like yourself at that age for comfort.You might further feel that you were in too deep to cut them loose; especially as they were showing signs; buried in their earnestness, but there nonetheless, of promise that could lead them to become much better adults than you felt.You, further to all that, might be concerned at how to marry that with the need to actually do your job and keep your charge alive for as long as possible; even unto your future mandated betrayal. Which you so wished you could see a way out of. Then you might see in this new – possible – female influence a way of providing a release from your charge's overwhelmingly masculine social group which, in the dog eat dog atmosphere of an American High School, could leave all three of them dangerously isolated. Carefully you retreat as you realise you've got too close behind them, but not before you hear the older woman offer her hacking ~ whatever that was ~ in return for your charge carrying on with the work on the sets; also promising  doughnuts; pizza and some of those horrendously sugary confections Americans called mochas. So you decide to stand, eventually, where you are, until you are sure they are safe inside the bus station. Feeling hungry yourself now, you might recall the younger boy offering you and the aforementioned Xander, pizza and a movie at his house, since his parents were going out to visit relatives and would not mind at all a teacher acting chaperone; since you couldn't be somethng they were too old for anyway.Sadly you might also reflect on how grateful Xander looked at the prospect at this, possibly, meaning not having to go home at all. As you turn away, your thoughts might avoid what their choice of filmic entertainment might be and turn to the easily digested pizza; as long as you could persuade them to stay away from those evil anchovies... You might also decide her report could wait until morning.      Morning Song      Hark, hark, the lark at heaven’s gate sings,And Phoebus gins arise,His steeds to water at those springsOn chalic’d flow’rs that lies;And winking Mary-buds begin to opetheir golden eyes;With every thing that pretty is, my lady sweet, arise:Arise, arise!      (Act 2, Scene 3, William Shakespeare's Cymbeline)   kerk
