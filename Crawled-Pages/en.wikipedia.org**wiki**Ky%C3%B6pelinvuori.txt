Kyöpelinvuori (Finnish  from kyöpeli = obsolete word for ghost and vuori = mountain), in Finnish mythology, is the place which dead women haunt.[citation needed] It is rumoured that virgins who die young gather there after their death at the start of their afterlife. It corresponds to Blockula (in modern Swedish Blåkulla) of Swedish mythology. 
Kyöpelinvuori is also well known in Finland due to Easter: it is said to be the ancient home of mountain witches who fly on brooms with black cats. The witches leave the area only during Easter in order to spook children. These witches have also been humorously referred to be spinsters who will end up there in order to escape from the "old maid" tax.[citation needed]
According to the National Land Survey of Finland, there is a total number of 32 Kyöpelinvuori hills in Finland.[1]
