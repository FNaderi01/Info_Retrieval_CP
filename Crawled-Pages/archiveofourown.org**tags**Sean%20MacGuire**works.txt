    Summary
      Tessa Evangeline "Evie" Locke is a wealthy woman, with a wealthy father, with a strong passion for adventure, and a strong disliking of waiting around and being bored to death by the suitors her father introduces to her. Sure, she loves needlepoint, but just like her mother, she wants more than a life of domesticity -- and a life that's more than domesticity is exactly what she's going to get.

    Summary
      “These creatures are extremely territorial, Mr. Marston. Most importantly, once the inner beast chooses his mate, he will go to the ends of hell to bring it back. "The old gypsy woman's empty eyes caused John's spine to chill."B... but I am a man!" How could he be?The gypsy laughed at John's confusion. "That's what matters least. He chose you, John. The beast wants you, and I can see... he marked you. He will kill anything that is between you two, to protect you."In the background, a roar cut the air. "And he's here."

      "The wolves in the woods have sharp teeth and long claws, but it's the wolf inside who will tear you apart."Charles has been running with the Van der Linde gang for around six months. They're not your typical gang, men and women, alphas, betas and omegas all working together.There were only three rules in the gang: no killing in camp, contribute to the camp’s donation box and no mates.But there was one unspoken rule: Arthur Morgan is off-limits.

    Summary
      Eliza Cornwall gets kidnapped by the Van der Linde gang to blackmail her father, Leviticus Cornwall, for a large sum of money to finally leave North America and settle down in Tahiti. Unbeknown to them, he doesn't care much about her, leaving her fate yet unknown.This is my first work so the writing may be a bit clumsy. The story I've got in mind is long, much longer than anticipated at first, and I'm not sure how regularly I'll be able to update this. I'm aiming for once a week, unless life happens.Graphic violence, nudity and assaults will be described, so please proceed with caution if any of these issues trigger you. Warnings will be at the beginning of the chapters. There will also be some smut, but that's relatively far in the future, what would a slow burner be, if we got to the juicy bits right away, aye?The timeline of this tale is muddled up with the events in the game, the biggest dissimilarities are: Arthur will not obtain TB. We start off in Horseshoe Overlook, although the Blackwater fiasco was a couple years back. Sadie has been running with the gang for a while, making a name for herself in the world.

    Summary
      In the early 1890s, the Van der Linde Gang were truly at their finest. Experts at stealing from the rich and giving to the poor, they've made a name for themselves across the West. Two of their newest recruits, a pair of rebellious Irish siblings with an unknown past, slowly find their footing and settle into their new lives as outlaws.And yet, as they grow older, threats from all sides begin to appear. A strained relationship with Colm O'Driscoll spells disaster for the gang, and no matter how far they roam across America, the world continues to change around them. If they want to survive, difficult choices must be made.No one is as they seem and the impending arrival of law and order threatens to tear the siblings, and everything they hold dear, apart. Is it too late for anyone to find a happy ending?

      „Shite…” There goes his composure. Yeah, Sean definitely saw this man before during Battle City and he undoubtedly had the same stupid fucked up thoughts that sneak back up on him right now. Another sip of his beer, perhaps to gather some fake courage or something, Seto Kaiba’s flat arse and pretty blue eyes shoved far away from him and Sean is up on his feet in order to talk to this undoubtedly handsome duelist. // After Battle City and a heated argument with Seto Kaiba, Sean MacGuire finds himself in a bar - only to shortly meet up with Marik Ishtar and have something be set in motion right then and there.

    Summary
