            How to get out of feeling sluggish        Lately I’ve been struggling with a weird brain fog and general tiredness. This often turns into laziness which makes me feel really crappy. So today I wanted to share the things I do to get back on track or to feel a bit refreshed at least:Take a shower -No matter whether you do or don’t feel dirty, this should be your first step. The fresh smell of soap and washing away the tiredness/laziness feels amazingOpen the window -At least for a moment because fresh air brings energyChange your sheets and towels -This one isn’t absolutely necessary however fresh sheets and towels feel great and almost make things feel newClean up your space and make the bed -These tasks aren’t overly complicated and they set you into productive mood. Plus organised and cleaned space helps you feel more put togetherMove your body -When I’m in a slump it’s usually accompanied by an odd body stiffness, so let’s get rid off that one!Make an exciting to do list -Easier said than done, I know… But try to add something that you like doing or gets you closer to your goals. It also never hurts to look up some inspiring people or even aestheticsUpbeat music -Listening to quick paced and upbeat often helps me feel a bit more excited to live my lifePrepare for the next day -To avoid falling back to feeling lazy the next day, prepare your clothes, room and to-do list for the upcoming day!

My New Favorite Way to Tackle Long To Do Lists: The Randomized Task Wrangler Method(I can’t for the life of me remember where I first heard of a method like this, so if anyone happens to know please comment it or DM me so I can include it!)Lately I’ve been using this technique since, at least for me, doing online classes has meant that my list of to do’s is perpetually long and a bit overwhelming at times. In comes this method, which I’m going to call the “Randomized Task Wrangler Method”Here’s how I do it:1. Write down all the stuff you hope to do today on a long to do list in any order2. Number them in order of where they are on the list (I write the numbers to the left of the check boxes)3. Draw a line on the right side of the page, leaving a little room both on the left and right sides of the line where you can write4. Write an ‘E’ (for “Estimated”) to the top left of the line and an ‘A’ (for “Actual”) to the top right, then draw a line beneath them to section that off as headers for columns5. In the E column, write the approximate time that you think it will take you to do each task, being generous and then rounding up to the nearest 56. Use a random generator website or app to pick a random number between 1 and whatever your highest number is (for my list, between 1 and 15)7. Set a timer for the amount of time you wrote down in the E column, then do the task it picks out for you8. When you’re done, cross out the check box and write in the A column how long it actually took you to complete it9. If you have any remaining time,  use it as a break (or you can do this every couple tasks if you prefer taking slightly longer breaks, then just add up the remaining time from the last couple tasks)10. Repeat as needed!

            How to be more organised        I thought I owe everyone a useful post so here are some tips on staying a bit more organised:Keep the things you use the most always around -Besides having your phone, keys and wallet it’s handy to have a pen, planner (or at least some paper), watch and other thingsDon’t switch bags too often and keep useful stuff in them- That way you’re less likely to forget things at home and you’re ready to leave quickerWrite things down immediately -Appointments, ideas and notes. Write these things down to make sure you don’t forget anythingChecklists -Have a place where you can check off things that are done and where you can clearly see what still needs to be doneMake checking your calendar a part of your routine -You’ll be less likely to forget eventsPut things where they belong immediately after using them -Especially finished work and projects should be sent/put in the bag as soon as possibleIf you have to wake up early, prepare your clothes/things the evening beforeClean up regularly -Life happens and sometimes we end up piling up bunch of mess. Make sure to keep your space clean and things are where they’re supposed to beKeep some kind of weekly/daily schedule -It can be really simple but knowing that for example you meal prep every Wednesday and Saturday or that Sunday is cleaning day can be helpful sometimes.Write down what needs to be done but you don’t have time for yet -You’ll have a list of things that need attention eventuallyI hope I helped and now back to shitposting
