    Summary
      “Red. Definitely red.”“Jiejie, of course we’re going with red but don’t you think a suit will fit them more?”“Aiya, Meimei. Red suits will be too much, ah!” Xiao Mama says, leaning back in her seat. “My ZhanZhan is always a traditional boy at heart so a changsan will fit him more. I’m sure your YiBo will also look dashing in a matching set. What do you think, Meimei? I know this tailor at home--”“No need ah. They will get married in the city so it will be too troublesome if the tailor is in your hometown. Leave it to Meimei.” Wang Mama says as she nods her head firmly.
