Garcetti discussed the assistance from the federal government. Mayor Garcetti is looking into protection for displaced workers.

Many Angelenos are facing anxiety and depression, Los Angeles County has resources from the city’s mental health department.

Their programs look to assist African Americans, Latino, LGBTQ, Asian-Pacific Islander, and Middle eastern communities.
