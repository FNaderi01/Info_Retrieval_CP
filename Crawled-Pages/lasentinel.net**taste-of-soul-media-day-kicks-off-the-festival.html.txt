				By Brian W. Carter, Crenshaw &amp; Around Editor

On Friday, October 20, Taste of Soul (TOS) Media Day kicked off the coming TOS festival with music, vendors and multi-media outreach. You can think of it as a pre-TOS party that gets everybody warmed up for the big day. Sponsors, vendors, city officials and outside media outlets all visit the L.A. Sentinel office on Media Day before the big event.
TOS vendors like Nana Queens Puddery, Chef C’s Smhokin’ Pot, Dulan’s On Crenshaw Soul Food, Blue Ribbon Desserts: Bakery and Bistro, Triiibe Lyfe, Munchfest and Mobile Mammogram Program came out for TOS Media Day. They also got a chance to meet with media TOS sponsors 94.7 The WAVE, CBS2 &amp; KCAL9 and spoke with the L.A. Sentinel about TOS.
First time TOS Vendor, Chef Ashe and her restaurant, Triiibe Lyfe, were on display at Media Day. She brought her mentor along with her, who came all the way from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to help her showcase her brand.

Triiibe Life is about promoting a wholistic lifestyle through fashion, raw Vegan food, energy healing, and spirituality. Chef Ashe spoke about how she found out about TOS attending the Nappywood Natural Hair Expo and an attendee told her she should be a vendor at the TOS festival.

“I’m so excited, trust me, I’m so excited,” said Chef Ashe. “I went online and I was like, ‘oh my God, I got to be here’.”
“Some vendors told me that I needed to come out and be a vendor at Taste of Soul,” said Sharon Hutcherson, owner of Blue Ribbon Desserts Bakery and Bistro. Along with her daughter, Hutcherson was looking forward to meeting all the people who come out to TOS and presenting her brand.

TOS sponsor, law firm, Ivie, Mcneil &amp; Wyatt (IMW) were at Media Day, taking in the festivities as well. IMW attorney, partner and director, Eulanda Lynn Matthews, spoke with the L.A. Sentinel on Media Day.
“We’re glad to be back,” said Matthews. “We’re an African American-owned law firm and we want to continue to be a part of the community.”
She continued, “It’s important that the community recognizes when they need a legal professional that they need not go outside their community.”

“We believe in what Bakewell [Media] is doing making sure Black businesses are spotlighted,” said Matthews.
StarQuest 2017 Kids Finalist Jhala Angelique and Adult Finalist, Terrill Williams Carter stopped by for TOS Media Day. Both ladies gave impressive performances giving everyone a preview of the raw talent they would bring on the day of Taste of Soul.
“Media Day is an opportunity to preview a little ‘Taste’ of the Taste of Soul—a snapshot of what’s going to take place at the Taste of Soul the next day,” said Pamela Bakewell, EVP &amp; COO of the L.A. Sentinel/Bakewell Company.

“Bakewell Media is always excited to display the excitement, fun and entertainment to the general media so the public will be enticed to come out and support this free community event the next day.
“And, the 350,000 loyal Taste of Soul Nation supporters never disappoint.”
