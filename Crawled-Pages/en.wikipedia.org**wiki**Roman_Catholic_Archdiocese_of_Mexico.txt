The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mexico (Latin: Archidioecesis Mexicanensis) (erected September 2, 1530, as the Diocese of Mexico) is the metropolitan diocese of Mexico City. It was elevated on February 12, 1546.[1][2]
The archdiocese is the largest in the world, with more than 5 million Catholics.[3] Its territory comprises the Federal District of Mexico, while its suffragen dioceses extended into the states of Mexico and Morelos. As of 28 September 2019, its suffragan dioceses include three dioceses erected from its own territory: Azcapotzalco, Iztapalapa, and Xochimilco.
The seat of the Archdiocese is the Metropolitan Cathedral, Mexico City.
