            One Summer, Part VI: SMS        Fab new moodboard brought to you by @balfeheughlywed and the will not to delete this whole thing brought to you by @smashing-teacups.

There was precisely one more kiss between them before they parted for the day after the early termination of their curb-side breakfast.
Tucked into the alcove leading into the fucking-bed-and-breakfast’s kitchen, Jamie pressed Claire to the wall and absconded with her breath like a thief jumping bail.  The air charged as he kissed her (only after aligning his hips to hers, pinning her to the wall so she could feel each breath he drew and expelled). 
Any haze that had existed around the periphery of their relationship had lifted during the kiss they had shared earlier on the curb, in his admission of what he wanted to do to her and the label he had put on it.
Fling.
More than a one-off.
Her fingers wound into his shirt, wrinkled it as his eyes made a meal of her mouth.
And the intention of his touch roaming her everywhere like a multi-armed god (over her fingertips, along the lines of her palms, against her belly and her breasts) felt like a push to an inevitable conclusion.
Towards the kind of thing that generally dwelt only in the annals of history.  Reduced to cellulose and set up with bright musical numbers (summer loving, had me a blast, a summer fling that don’t mean a thing, summer nights, a gossipy girlfriend begging for more more more).  She needed it.  Her heart threatened to burst at the thought of this man (the one with his mouth hovering over hers hers, hands at her waistband, knee knocking her trembling legs apart) stretched above her, pulsing inside of her, wiping away the frustration of the last few months like a hand across a foggy mirror after a shower. 
Only then did he kiss her, making her mouth sing.

            Third Time’s The Charm - Prologue        Author’s Note (it’s going to be long, I am so sorry): I’ve had this story brewing in my mind for a little over a year, but it wasn’t until I was DM’ing in January with @sassy-sassenach over a post (that is relevant to this story!) that we were both fangirling over that I thought: hm. Maybe I could write this? So, a thank you to her for encouraging me and thinking of me during this initial writing process!A few more thank you’s to some people who have the patience of saints and the willingness to sit through hours of me talking about this story:@smashing-teacups, who graciously offers her experience in the medical field to help my plots and who lets me fire away random words at her when I was thinking of this title.@suzannevvale​ and @balfey​ for letting me spill out countless ideas for these two soulmates to y’all and for being the best encouragers.@ladyviolethummingbird, for her routine check-ins on me and my story. They mean so much, more than you’ll know!and @desperationandgin, for your fantastic encouragement.This is a story that is so near and dear to my heart, and I hope it finds a place among the wonderful fic in the Outlander community for you readers to enjoy. The story continues below the cut. Here we go!Third Time’s The Charm: Jamie and Claire are reunited in 1764 after nearly 18 years apart. They make the decision to settle down in Edinburgh, and life gives them another chance at a dream long denied to them. (AO3)June 1766His body felt every bit of his forty-five years of age as he gracelessly chased the squealing toddler around his shop. Ever since she had learned to walk just before her first birthday, her tiny yet chubby legs propelled her everywhere she desired to go. His clothes were covered in soot after a long day of printing, but that didn’t stop him from trying to make her laugh as loudly as possible, even though he knew her mother would have words for him for getting the tiny mischief-maker’s dress dirty.“Mo chuisle, a leannan, I’m coming for ye!”She shrieked in delight at his teasing and her running proved futile as he scooped her up in his arms. He kissed her relentlessly on her cheeks, realizing that although her dark curly hair would likely hide any trace of his failure to clean up before taking her into his arms, her dirt-covered face would nevertheless give him away.He heard a sudden gasp from above, and his eyes immediately locked with those of a young woman standing on the balcony overlooking his printing press. With fiery red hair peaking out underneath the hood of a plum cloak, her eyes conveyed a haunting sense of familiarity that he struggled to rationalize.Realizing it was no longer just him and the wee spitfire, he cleared his throat and adopted a somewhat professional demeanor. “Good evenin’, can I help ye, mistress?” He adjusted his grip on the bairn, who currently had her arms wrapped tightly around his neck as if holding on for dear life, and propped her on his hip. As he walked up the stairs towards the visitor, his mind began to fight against the frighteningly supernatural sense that overwhelmed his thought process:  You know this lass.“I—” she started, seemingly unable to decide how she wanted continue her sentence. “I….it’s you two that I’m looking for.”Confused by the stranger’s direct statement and the unusual accent formulating her words, he briefly glanced down at the whisky eyes innocently staring back at him before focusing back on the woman.“I’m sorry, mistress, but ye’ve caught me by surprise. I’m no’ sure what ye mean.”“Are you Jamie Fraser?”Now at a closer distance, he studied the blue in her familiar eyes as her gaze met his, its steadiness undermined by the lass’s wringing hands.“Aye,” he confirmed along with a nod, further unsettled by this visitor’s acknowledgment of his name. “Are ye in need of somethin’ from me?”The confidence in her stare vanished as she took a step back. Her clearly evident nerves began to take a toll on his own heart rate, but he didn’t want to further scare the poor young woman. She looks so much like my mother, he fleetingly thought, hoping that the eerily similar physical comparison adequately explained why goosebumps had slowly traveled down his arms from the moment he saw her.“Have ye a message for me, lass?” January 1764, two and a half years earlier “Pardon?” I nervously blurted out, reaching my hand to gently touch the shoulder of the delivery boy that looked as if he might know about Jamie’s whereabouts. “I’m looking for a printer. Mr. Malcolm. Alexander Malcolm?”“Aye!” he answered, his eyes reflecting his immediate shift from confusion to recognition. “He’s located at the end of Carfax Close, which’ll be the first on yer left.”With that quick confirmation, my heart froze. I realized that I had long been preparing myself for the likelihood that I’d reach a dead end in my quest to find Jamie — that my hope of finding him would never truly materialize, but would instead remain within the four corners of the copy of the printed poem firmly grasped in my hands.After thanking the boy and watching him walk away, I took a deep breath to steady myself. It seemed almost pointless to do so at this juncture, as my racing heartbeat and shaking hands indicated that I wouldn’t be leaving this stage of adrenaline anytime soon. I grabbed my glasses from my coat pocket and placed them on the tip of my nose, fondly remembering that Brianna had been the one to pick these out for me and my tiring eyes a few years ago.                                               ———————-Frank had died in a car accident ten years after Jamie sent me back through the stones. Ironically, I was on the clock at the local hospital on the same night he was brought into our emergency room. As I left a final check-in with a patient whose surgery had thankfully produced no complications, I heard a soft “Claire” come from Joe, my dear friend and colleague. The fact that he called me by my Christian name and not the playful Lady Jane nickname that he had based solely on my apparently posh accent was the first warning sign. The second stemmed from the tone in which he said my name — the same tone that we, as young doctors, learned to adopt when communicating tragic news to worried loved ones.“It’s Frank,” Joe continued. “He was brought here after paramedics discovered him at the scene. It was a car accident. He— he was dead on arrival. I’m so, so sorry, Claire.”I still remember nothing between the moment after Joe broke the news to me and the realization of finding myself sitting in a cold, narrow, echo-filled room with white-tiled walls and a standard linoleum-patterned floor. Sitting next to a body, laid out on a metal stretcher, that once held my first husband’s charm, intelligence, disdain, resentment, and grief-filled and eventually unrequited love for me.As I carefully studied Frank’s face for what I knew would be the last time, I grew paralyzed by a wave of conflicting emotions. A sense of love for him that had undeniably evolved over the past thirteen years, beginning the moment I first traveled through the stones during our second honeymoon in Scotland. It was a love that was no longer romantic, but instead nostalgic and supported by a foundation of likely undeserved gratitude towards him. A deeply-rooted pang of guilt for never completely re-immersing myself in the reality of Claire &amp; Frank  — a guilt that stemmed from the belief that, in my inability to irreversibly shut the door on the most powerful thing I had ever experienced, I let both Jamie and Frank down. A heart-shattering realization that Brianna’s tenth birthday would be her last with the man she lovingly knew as her father.However, the feeling that came the most naturally at that moment was the one I would deny the quickest. A feeling that would stay buried, never to be recognized again. Relief. Frank’s passing released the verbal muzzle he had placed on me when we started our new life together. I had lived a decade without uttering a single word or phrase that could reasonably be traced back to Jamie Fraser. I had tried to apply the same rigor of mental training I developed in medical school to the inevitably futile task of wiping my memory clean of any treasured memories of my life with Jamie. I had remained complicit in the heartbreaking lie regarding Brianna’s parentage. I had fulfilled every requirement of Frank’s cruel conditions, and now I was free.                                         ————————Seven years after Frank’s passing, I was back in 1764, glancing down at the paper in my hands and skimming the already-memorized words printed by one Alexander Malcolm. A. Malcolm, Jamie’s pseudonym in Edinburgh — a discovery made by Roger Wakefield, a young historian that Brianna and I met during a week in Scotland that changed both of our lives. Shortly after her fifteenth birthday, I took Brianna to Inverness and told her everything about her father. Jamie Fraser. The man who destroyed his own heart for our protection. The proud Highlander who, until a month ago, I believed had died on the battlefields in Culloden.Brianna and I had carefully rebuilt our collective history over the two years following that fateful trip, a process filled with questions she asked that I never hesitated to answer. We slowly accepted Jamie’s fate as part of our own familial narrative, but the curious Mr. Wakefield never did. He kept researching, kept venturing down promising paths — which is how I found myself, on Christmas Eve in 1965, with unimpeachable proof that Jamie was still alive. He had beaten death in battle and in prison. He was a free man, working as a printer for the main newspaper in town, The Edinburgh Advertiser.This earth-shattering discovery resulted in a month-long campaign of constant encouragement from Brianna for me to go back and find Jamie. The thought had undeniably crossed my mind the second it registered that Jamie was alive in his own time, but I never seriously considered the possibility of returning to him until my daughter — our daughter — began making the ultimate push. Joe and Gail unconditionally vowed to take care of Brianna, both of them having been let in on the secret of my strange journey back in time (which included a blunt observation from Joe himself: I always knew Brianna had so much of you and so little of Frank).Brianna never failed to remind me that she would miss me. That bittersweet tinge was constantly present in her voice, even when she would quip about how she was “all grown up” — how she wanted me around, but didn’t need me like she did when she was younger. But she always ended each remark with the same conclusion: Jamie gave you to me, now I’m giving you back to him. And you get to tell him everything about me. At the end of January 1966, I made the journey two-hundred-and-two years back in time, carrying nothing but a small and hidden arsenal of modern-day treasures and necessities that I could never leave behind.She weighed heavily on my mind as I turned onto Carfax Close. Our beautiful daughter, the perfect creation of my and Jamie’s lives. Brianna was the one reassurance that my years with Jamie were true and undoubtedly mine. I brought pictures of her with me, tucked safely in one of my many pockets, and I prayed that Jamie would want to see them. I had no idea what his life looked like now, but I hoped that I was still enough for him.At the heart of Carfax Close, I spotted a wrought iron sign dangling in front of a tall wooden staircase that led to the shop’s entrance. A. Malcolm, Printer, Edinburgh Advertiser. My heartbeat quickly traveled up into my eardrums as I stretched out my hand and gently touched the black letters of the name. Jamie’s name.A. Malcolm. Alexander Malcolm.Removing my hand, I forced myself up the stairwell before the frayed thread of courage keeping my will together had the chance to snap. Once I reached the shop entrance, I removed my glasses and nervously patted down my wild curls one more time before shoving open the heavy oak door.                                          ————————“Christ!”Jamie yelled in frustration as he fought with his incredibly stubborn printing press. He had arrived just after dawn to begin his daily routine of printing several hundred copies of advertisements and essays for The Edinburgh Advertiser. However, he hadn’t accounted enough time for the lever to his main press deciding to jam; so he sent Geordie, his assistant, off to find some tools. The lad had been gone for more than an hour when Jamie finally heard the entrance doorbells chime, and he sighed in much-welcomed relief.“Took ye long enough, now get down here if ye would and help me.”When he heard neither a verbal confirmation nor the man’s usual speedy footsteps approaching, Jamie took a moment to stretch out the temporary hunchback he had developed in the battle with the lever jam. Satisfied with the melody of cracks that rippled down his aching back, he began to kneel down when he heard the words that would irrevocably change his life once again.“It isn’t Geordie.”No, he thought. That can’t be her. I’m imaginin’ her voice. I’m goin’ mad.“It’s me.” A pause. “Claire.”Oh, Christ.With his back turned away from the visitor, he shut his eyes tightly and took a few calming breaths. Keep it together. This is just another one of yer dreams. Ye’ll make it through. Just turn around. Nobody will be there, and ye can get back to reality.“Jamie?”Real or not, that pleading voice was forever a siren call to him, and he mentally prepared himself for heartbreak as he turned around. What he saw rendered him speechless.A Dhia, she was so beautiful.Her dark brown curls framed the same delicate glass face that he had fallen in love with almost twenty years ago. The golden eyes that he knew all too well contained the same combination of nervousness and hope that was reflected in her half-smile. They were both frozen at the root, neither of them wanting to budge out of fear that their eyes were truly deceiving them.Never breaking eye contact with him, Claire — or, at this point, a dangerously real vision of her — slowly descended the stairs and approached him. As she drew closer, Jamie saw the faint lines framing her eyes and mouth, reflecting a life undoubtedly hard-fought. She stopped about five feet away from him, having reached a self-imposed physical barrier, and he quickly realized that he hadn’t said a single word since setting his eyes on her.Swallowing one more time, as if to physically remove the ball of nerves constricting his voice, the corners of his mouth lifted slightly.“Sassenach, is it truly you?”Seemingly rendered speechless herself, Claire’s smile reached its full wattage as she moved closer and covered his left hand with both of hers. Her hands sought the silver-tinted “C” scar she had imprinted on him as a reminder that their life together was truly theirs. Her watery eyes followed the movements of her thumbs, gently tracing the scar, back and forth. Flinching as though an electric spark had passed between them, any notion in Jamie’s mind that Claire was merely a vision induced by long days with little sleep immediately shattered.“You’re real,” he whispered. “God in heaven, you’re real.”“So are you,” Claire softly uttered in response as she met his eyes, tears escaping her own. “I—I thought you were dead.”Jamie pulled her hard against him as they collapsed onto each other. They were both shaking, and neither could have said how long they sat there on the soot-covered floor, tears of longing spilling down both of their faces. Eighteen years apart had not erased the familiarity and rightness of having Claire in his arms, and Jamie found himself silently praying Gaelic pleas as he drew her closer to him —  Lord, thank ye for bringing her back to me. Please dinna let this be for a moment, but instead for forever. I canna live without her.“Don’t be afraid,” Claire whispered softly against his chest, likely sensing the irrational fear in his tight grip. Those words harkened Jamie back to their wedding night, the rush of memories culminating in his strange response of a mix between a choke and laugh.Stroking her cheek, he rested his head on top of hers, finishing that soothing reassurance he had told her all those years ago.“There’s the two of us now.”Next chapter

around and playing in the hills. The clouds had lifted and the lake they were

I’ve Been Missing You, Lately: Part 4Part 1/Part 2/Part 3Shout out to @kkruml for who she is and all she does. Go find yourselves one of these kinds of people. I walked out of the bar, wrapping my arms around my waist, a shield for whatever pieces of my heart I had left. As I stepped fully outside with the door closed behind me, I found his blue eyes piercing into mine. Whisky meeting blue – just like they had on that dreaded day when we said our goodbyes. I could hear his tone of voice in the background—but my mouth rattled the words quicker than I had intended. I didn’t mean the words— no – not with any fiber in my being, yet I had said them. “I’m in love with another man, Jamie.” I heard the hollowness in my voice as I spoke. The empty pit I had become as a person the last 2 years flashed right in front of me.I watched the corners of his mouth form a small smile as he spoke. “No yer not.”Bloody Scot, could always read me like a book. “How in the BLOODY hell do you know that?” I yelled at him as I took a step closer towards him. “No yer not. Ye hopped on a plane, didna pack, ‘cause ye are still in yer scrubs.” Jamie started as he took a small step forward—closing the proximity between us —“I ken because you are here, Sassenach.” I stopped and put my hand up, not allowing him to come any closer and took a deep breath. “You look horrible. Like you’ve been run over by a locomotive.”That got me a small Scottish grunt and a humorless laugh as he ran his fingers through his hair. “After ye ran out on me this morning, I needed to talk to someone who… Would understand. So, I thought of Jenny, naturally. Her and Ian and the bairns are out in Glasgow, visiting Ian’s parents. Ye dinna even let me explain…”“Well, there wasn’t much to say, you had another woman in your bed.” “Ye didna stay to let me give ye the story.” “Mmm.” I humphed at him as I raised an eyebrow at him.“It has only ever been you, surely ye ken that.”“You LEFT.” I screamed as I clenched my fists by my sides. “No letters, no phone calls, nothing. For two bloody fucking years.” I watched as he crossed his arms, tilting his head to the side, urging me to continue. “I went to Lallybroch, to say my own goodbyes. About three months after you had left, and right before I moved to Boston. They were like family to me, you know!” I watched his eyes soften as I spoke of our farewell—of his family who had also become my family—the memories that haunted our past coming back to our present. “She said you had written her, and you had told her that I should move on, not wait for you, that you didn’t have the heart to tell me yourself….. And I did that. I moved on because you didn’t have the guts to tell me yourself!” my voice cracked as I struggled to keep it from shaking— I could feel my face was red – probably the reddest it had ever been. I was borderline in full-fledged panic mode. I had never gone off on anyone like this. Jamie’s face was flat – he didn’t even know how to respond. “I didna do—“ “I AM NOT FINISHED YET!” I interjected at a high-pitched noise. “And I wrote you, EVERY DAY FOR A YEAR. And not a WORD back, James Fraser.” “Sassen—““DON’T CALL ME THAT.”He stopped and I could see his cheeks blush a faint shade of red as he bit his tongue. “You don’t get to call me that, you don’t get to do anything because YOU stopped caring. YOU stopped loving me!” I finished with the last bit of energy I had—barely audible, as the tears started to flow down my cheeks. Now, I was hysterical.“NO.” I heard him hiss at me as he took a step closer to me. Now our noses were merely inches apart and I could feel his breath warm on my lips. “NO.” I stood a bit straighter, squaring my shoulders. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest, my pulse strong in my ears, my breathing extremely shallow. He wanted to get a reaction out of me, and it was working.  “YOU’RE TEARING MY GUTS OUT, CLAIRE. DO YE REALLY NO’ SEE IT?”I closed my eyes, as the sobs started to come over me. He placed his hands on my shoulders and I could feel his grip tighten.“Do ye know what I dreamed about, every day in that damn desert?”I shook my head sheepishly at him, not opening my eyes. “Of you, Sassenach. Yer hair in that god’s awful bird’s nest when ye first wake up in the morning, how ye dinna like peppermint toothpaste so ye always taste like spearmint when ye used to kiss me goodbye in the mornings.” I didn’t open my eyes, but my ears caught the crack in inflection, an intimacy his tone as he recalled the mornings we used to spend together. “How ye like yer coffee black and yer breakfast tea with a dash of cinnamon, and ye smell of lemons when I used to bring ye lunches at the hospital because of the hand sanitizer ye keep in yer pocket. I used to dream ye were lying next to me on that cot, that I’d wait up and smell your curls that smelled like lavender and honey.” “Jamie… You have to st—““NO. I dinna have to stop! I DIDNA ken ye wrote me…. I never got a thing. And if ye werena so GODDAMN STUBBORN, YE WOULD HAVE LET ME FINISH MY STORY.”I felt my shield crack at his words. He had never gotten my letters? Had he spent all this time as hurt and confused as I had been? What did this mean? Could I open this door again? No – that was the past, and I could not handle being hurt again. Not by Jamie – I had barely survived the first time. To love him – and then lose him again—it would end me. “There is nothing left to tell…” “DAMMIT SASSENACH!” He grunted as he shook me, almost violently. I opened my eyes and looked up to his to realize I had never seen this look on his face, I didn’t know how to respond. His eyes were glossy—a film of tears on the brink of falling. I could see the heartbreak written on his face as clear as day. I thought my heart had hurt – but by the pain escaping the lines of his face, he had had the worst end of the bargain. “Jenny admitted to me she told ye to move on. She was angry at me for leaving for another tour, when I dinna need to. She was angry at you too, for leaving for Boston. She was just angry at the fact we both left her… She was angry because she lost us both at the same time…” “My let—lette—letters?” I managed to croak, almost incoherently, but I got the words out.“Shortly after I was deployed, we were on a mission somewhere in the Hindu Kush mountains – my unit, we were bombarded. 4 of my men died from an IED, 2 from bullet wounds to the skull. I was the only survivor, kept a prisoner of war for 10 months.” “Oh my god.” Another crack in the remaining pieces of whatever shield I had left. I was timid at first, as I slumped my shoulder, the anger slowly dissipating from me as my healing instincts wanted to kick in – and I placed my hand over his heart. “Shh. Let me finish, Sassenach.”  He said as he hushed me, his grasp loosening on me and his tone of voice lowering. I looked away, in fear of where I had a feeling the conversation was headed. I knew too well the hardships of war, I had seen the battered US soldiers back in Boston.“It was Dougal, my uncle, ye remember? Well… I, was tortured, many a time. For information, that I wouldna give them. Dougal and his team, rescued me, and I had a verra long road to recovery. Dougal kept the letters, didna let anyone save for him and the doctors, talk to me, or know what had happened… My status of recovery.” I held my breath as I directed my glance towards his once more. Those sea blue eyes- I had known like the back of my hand and dreamed of every night since he had departed from me – were now overcome by of a cloud of grey as he relived the hell. Of things I could not even fathom or pretend to comprehend.I could taste the salt from my tears on the corner of my mouth. I let out my breath, and I said his name. “Jamie.” “Ye see, Sassenach. I didna forget ye, I couldna forget ye for a second while I was gone. The only reason I survived, was because of YOU, Claire.” “I should have been told! I would have been there for you.” I grunted as I grabbed his biceps. I could feel my finger nails leaving marks, even through the layers of his jacket.“National Security, ye ken?”“I fucking ken alright! But Jamie, it was over before you left….We said goodbye….”“NO.” He said with a firm tone. “We said goodbye, but it WASNA over. It wasna over then, and it still isna over.” I couldn’t reply—his mouth claimed mine and for the first time in two years, I could breathe again.

            One Quote One Shot, Book #2        A/N: It feels so good to be writing again. Thank you to @notevenjokingfic and @balfeheughlywed for the work y’all put in to organizing this challenge! I have had even more of a blast this second round. My quote is below:“And I voyaged into him, as he into me, so that when the last small storms of love began to shake me, he cried out, and we rode the waves together as one flesh, and saw ourselves in each other’s eyes.”I have had this fic idea close to my heart ever since a few episodes after 4x01, when I realized we would not be getting any sort of conversation between Jamie and Claire about what they suffered at the hands of Bonnet, and the grief they likely carried over Claire’s Lallybroch ring being taken. I truly loved writing this, and I hope you enjoy it. (AO3 link is here, for those who prefer that). Finally, a big thank you to @claryclark, @wickedgoodbooks, and @smashing-teacups for keeping me sharp and being wonderful betas. &lt;3  ————————————————————————–“All I Need”The sharp chirping of nocturnal cardinals jolted my body awake. I could only absorb the navys and plums of the star-filled sky as I focused on steadying my breathing, sweat from the North Carolina summer clinging to every inch of my skin. The peaceful stillness of the night was a stark contrast to the pounding headache and soreness that radiated through my arms and legs as I slowly rose with my upper body. I glanced around my immediate surroundings, my heart rate spiking at the realization that even though I currently held one of Jamie’s plaids and a fire was roaring less than ten feet from me, he was nowhere to be found.Before I could even register the motion, my left hand sought my right, and my heart plunged into my stomach as I felt the naked skin of my right ring finger. I thought it had been a nightmare. It undoubtedly still was, but this one hadn’t been confined within the realms of my subconscious. Second by second, bits of the attack returned to the forefront.The pirates’ sickeningly gleeful smiles as they launched onto the boat, attacking us from all sides.The glimpse of fear and helplessness in Jamie’s eyes as they dragged him onto the deck.The life instantly disappearing from Lesley as he collapsed, blood pooling at my feet.Stephen Bonnet’s chilly, bony fingers pressed against my neck and prying open my tightly-shut jaw, single-handedly breaching my last line of defense for the rings I refused to surrender.The gutwrenching and complete devastation that wracked my body as I gagged up only one ring.The unrecognizable scream that burst from my lungs and rang through my ears when I discovered it wasn’t the ring I’d wanted to protect the most.

            STAY Ch 12        Thank you to @sassenachwaffles for your tireless cheerleading of my half-baked ideas, and to @missclairebelle- I know I interupted a bubble bath with a late night panic attack over the end of this chapter. Words just aren’t enough for you both.Mood MusicChapter 1Chapter 2Chapter 3Chapter 4Chapter 5Chapter 6Chapter 7Chapter 8Chapter 9Chapter 10Chapter 11AO3Previously“Jamie… for so long I’ve never felt like I belonged.” She paused, taking a breath
before continuing. Her voice was quiet, but steady, “My parents and I- we did travel quite a bit. Boston never
really felt like home- it was just a place to land for a spell before we were
off to the next adventure.”His mind conjured images of his own childhood. The large stone buildings and secret passages through the
woods that carved and molded his memories. The very stone walls of Lallybroch
had been home, at least long ago. He’d
always imagined being Laird, with his lady by his side. A mix of tradition and
adolescent daydreams that had once seemed like the logical step in his life’s
trajectory. It had been an all but foregone conclusion until a dark night and
the sound of twisted metal that scattered his future to the wind… until now.Her fingers found his hand and intertwined her fingers with
his, “Home- it’s always been an idea,
but not a place for me, Jamie.”Home. Loving her was now
home to him. The weight of her hand in his anchored him to the bench as he
struggled to keep a clear mind. “What is home to ye now, Sassenach?”Golden amber glowed in the early evening sun. “Home to me…
is you, Jamie.”Keep reading

            One Summer, Part X: Netflix &amp; Advil        Thanks everyone for sticking with me on this Jamie and Claire summer jaunt. Part I (Adso), Part II (Dislocated), Part III (Entryway), Part IV (Pizza &amp; Beer), Part V (Croissants &amp; Coffee), Part VI (SMS), Part VII (Desktop), Part VIII (Sunday Sunflowers &amp; Sundresses), Part IX (Caught Out)One SummerPart X: Netflix &amp; Advil
Twenty-seven cardboard boxes of subway tile and remodeling supplies crowded the manager’s office at Fraser Hardware.
Sitting in his office chair, a ballpoint pen branding an unseen-to-him blue splotch on his lower lip, Jamie Fraser eyed the boxes. The heaped pile of overdue accounts receivable he was supposed to be tracking down (routinely-delinquent customers who called Jamie “lad” and had an “arrangement” with the shop’s previous owner – Jamie’s godfather, Murtagh) had not gotten markedly thinner since he had commenced his stint as an amateur bill collector three hours earlier.
He had other things on his mind.
Claire Beauchamp, Owner-of-Leoch Manor, was chief among them (bony knees and bonnie breasts; full arse and filthy mouth).  The memory of being with her (the soft sigh of completion she made when she finally opened her eyes again after he’d taken her), of knowing that he could coax magic from the most sacred parts of her (a single hand going limp between his shoulder blades and trailing down, down, down to rest at his lower back, drawing patterns with a fingertip).  The sensation of his body constructing new organs – ones more elemental to survival than a heart or lungs (a faint “that’s good” mumbled as he slipped free of her and gathered her close to his chest in a bed that smelled of her).
Fuck.
Shaking his head, he put himself back to work, thumb underscoring the next name on his list of past due accounts.
MacKenzie, Colum - £1,895 (net 30, shingles + posting &amp; packing, 60 days past due)
His mother’s brother.  Of course, no one fails to pay the bills or avoid a phone call like a relative.

lilu117-deactivated20180709  asked:10. Ready for our dance? 💃 Set in The Fiery Cross Timeline, if you haven’t read it, mild spoilers. Not that it will likely stop you, but I did give you the warning. A/N: My left hand regrets me doing this, me on the other hand, not so much. Also, lub-dub is how scientists and doctors explain the sound of a beating heart. (It will make sense at the end of the fic, promise!) PS: @missclairebelle thank you for reenforcing that this was not a stupid fic in my THICK SKULL.PPS: @kkruml thank you for finishing my half finished sentences and when my words don’t make sense knowing EXACTLY what I am trying to convey and being able to fix my crap. My fics wouldn’t exist without you and I don’t have the words to express my gratitude every time you take time out of your day to help me.I felt Jamie’s arm around my waist as he pulled me closer towards him, the fire adding an extra glow of red to his already auburn filled face. He took a swig from the flask and passed it to me. “Here- have some Sassenach, it’ll warm ye.” He said as I took a small sip. “There are reasons I love you…. Keeping whisky nearby might be at the top of the list, though.” I laughed as I rested my head on his chest. My eyes flickered to the other side of the fire as I watched Bree pass Jemmy off to Marsali. Roger took her hand and led them just past where the groups were. It was dark, but thanks to the multiple fires and a full moon, I could see them just off in the distance. I felt Jamie’s eyes on me before shifting over in the direction of the newlyweds. My heart swelled as Roger bowed before Bree as he took her hands, and pulled her to his chest. They danced to the beat of their own rhythm, two souls sharing a single moment as one. I took my hand off Jamie’s waist, wiping a tear as it fell from my face. “Are ye alright Sassenach, I see what the two of them are doin’ over there, but I canna say I understand it.” I laughed as I sat upright, turning towards my husband. “Remember, they come from a different time.” I said softly as I placed my right hand on his cheek. “It is something that happens at every wedding during that time. It’s the bride and grooms first dance, it usually happens at the reception.” “Reception?” He asked with an incredulous look his face“Yes. Weddings in the twentieth century are a fairly big ordeal. Usually it’s a full day. There’s the ceremony at the church and then a reception that follows shortly after. It’s filled with dinner, drinks, family, friends… And a first dance, just like they’re doing over there.”  I said, nuzzling my head into his shoulder once more. “Did ye…. Did ye have a wedding like that the first time around?” His words sent chills down my spine causing me to hitch my breath and straighten my back a bit. Jamie twitched at this, wrapping his arms tighter around me.I took another sip of the whisky, as I handed it up to him. I took a few breaths as I watched our daughter and new son in law dance under the moonlight, trying to erase the thoughts of my first marriage.“No.” I said, finally, as Roger spun Bree out and twirled her, then bringing her back close to his chest. “Frank and I. It was done quickly. Right before the war, we went to city hall and had it done so things were just legally set into place. That was it.” I was pulled back to the quick five-minute ceremony at the courthouse. I thought I had been so sure then – but now, sitting in Jamie’s arms, that memory felt like a whole other life, a whole other Claire. Which it was, but still—without that marriage, I wouldn’t be where I was today. He was quiet for a minute and I could hear his heartbeat as it picked up in its pace. “But… Our wedding, was it much more like what it is… during her time?” I smiled at the memory– a highlander in full regalia, my highlander– my husband. I had not wanted him then, but oh how things had changed.  I needed him now like the air that filled my lungs. Keep reading

            Trading Wine for Whiskey (Bookshop AU): Chapter 4        Uhhhh… Welp. It’s been… a year. Thank you all SO MUCH for your incredible patience, your kind reviews, and your continued interest after all this time. I had a bit of a crazy year, but now:AT LONG LAST, MAY I PRESENT YOU WITH CHAPTER 4!This is a collaborative fic by @takemeawaytocamelot​ and myself. This chapter was written by me, @moghraidhjamie​CATCH UP: Ch. 1: Meet Cute | Ch. 2: Tea for Two | Ch. 3: Captain MurrayOn AO3Chapter 4: AgonySMS: Jamie Fraser     Jamie: Plz txt me before u go to bed     Jamie: Just to make sure everything’s alright     Jamie: If ye dinna mindLooking down at my phone, I couldn’t contain a hint of a smile as I sat in the cab on my way back to Frank’s from the bar, somewhat soothed by Jamie’s concern.     Me: Don’t worry. It’ll be fine.     Me: But if it’ll make you feel better.     Jamie: Thanks Ssnch.     Me: &lt;3His concern was sweet, but unfounded. Frank wasn’t a violent man, though his possessiveness was rankling at times. It was particularly bad in relation to Jamie, for some reason, which was upsetting. Though I’d only known him for a month, Jamie had fast become one of the dearest friends I’d ever had.Shaking my head and trying to simmer my righteous anger, I paid the cab driver and made my way into the house. I started at the sight that greeted me: Frank, leaning against the wall directly across from the front door with a glass of wine in his hand and a barely-controlled expression.“Do you have any idea what time it is?”“I didn’t realize I had a curfew.” My voice was cold and sharp. The nerve of him.Taking in my defensive posture, he relaxed slightly and put his wine on the end table next to him.“Of course… Claire, that’s not what I meant.” His tone was clearly meant to be pacifying, but it came across as more patronizing than anything else.“Then what did you mean?”“I missed you. And I worry.”“You were out.” Jamie’s words coming to mind, I continued, “What, did you just expect me to be home waiting for you?”“You’re always at work. Is it so much to ask that I see my fiancée occasionally?”“You were at a work function! I went out with friends. I’m not here to be at your beck and call, Frank.”“Which friends?”“Why does that matter?”“Which friends, Claire.”My temper rising, I spat out, “Jamie, alright? Jamie and Murtagh from the shop, and a bunch of their friends.”“You know I don’t like him.”“You know I don’t care.”He took a threatening step towards me. I stood my ground.Taking a deep breath, he stood down, knowing full well that I wouldn’t. “I don’t think it’s just your friendship he’s after, darling.”“You don’t know him. You met him for five minutes. I see him almost every day. He is just a friend, and the best friend I’ve made since we moved to Scotland. He’s important to me, and I’m not going to stop spending time with him because you can’t control your irrational jealousy.”Frank clenched and relaxed his fists a few times before sighing. “Fine. Fine. Let’s just go to bed and forget about this.”“Not tonight, Frank. I think I’m just going to go home. I’ll see you tomorrow.”“Don’t you have your ridiculous on-call shift tomorrow night?”“Yeah. We can grab dinner before I go, if you want.”“Just stay,” he pleaded.“I’ll see you tomorrow, Frank.” Pivoting on my heel, I left the house, closing the door behind me with a click.SMS: Claire Beauchamp     Claire: We had a row so I went back to my place.     Me: Ye alright?     Claire: Yeah. Fine. Just going to bed.     Me: Good night Ssnch. Breakfast tomorrow?     Claire: Late breakfast?     Me: Lol good idea. I’ll get Murtagh to cover. See you @ 11?     Claire: See you then. Night.It was Thursday night. After his breakfast with Claire that morning, Jamie was still a little concerned about her altercation with Frank. She had changed the subject enough times that he dropped it, but it was still on his mind. He knew she was now on a 30-hour on-call shift at the hospital. Poor lass.The first Thursday night of the month meant it was Murtagh’s turn to choose the movie. All of Murtagh’s dearest friends and family were sworn to secrecy (under threat of death) that there was nothing Murtagh loved more than musicals. Jamie sat on the couch between Murtagh and Ian, with Jenny next to Ian at the end of the couch. Since Jamie and Jenny’s father died five years before, Murtagh had been both father and friend to Jamie and Jenny. They all valued the time they spent together.Ian nudged Jamie, “Was Claire alright after last night?”“Aye, I think so.”“Her Professor is an arse,” Murtagh grunted as he scrolled through the musical section of Netflix. “She’s a canny lass and deserves better.”“Aye,” Jamie and Ian said in unison.“But it’s no’ my place te say anything. So long as he doesna hurt her.” Jamie glumly flipped through his phone as he spoke.“If he e’er does, we all ken ye’ll unleash hell on the man,” Ian came back to the couch, passing Jamie a dram of whisky.“Aye.”All settled in, Murtagh turned on Into the Woods.They were having a grand evening, drinking whisky, eating popcorn, laughing, and, in Murtagh’s case, singing. Until the film got to the song Agony.  Jamie felt Ian’s unsympathetic, mirthful gaze on him.“How shall I regain the heart she has won from me?Agony!Beyond power of speech.When the one thing you want is the only thing out of your reach.”Out of the corner of his eye, Jamie could see Ian’s growing smile. “Now who does that remind me of?”Jamie looked to Murtagh and Jenny for support, but saw nothing but smirks. Jenny pipped in, “There is an uncanny resemblance, brother.”Jamie sat back against the couch, grumbling, “Shut it, the lot of ye.”Jamie and Claire sat at their usual table at the café the following Monday. Claire looked tired, as she often did after an arduous night shift, but she seemed a little lighter that day, like a burden had been lifted.“Ye seem well pleased today, Sassenach.”“I am.” She took a sip of her tea, a small smile appearing above her cup.“Weel? Out wi’ it.”“Guess who’s done night shifts?”Jamie smiled at the satisfaction in her voice. “Yer kidding.”“Nope! I am vampire no more. Starting Wednesday morning, I’ll be sleeping at night and going to work after breakfast.”“Och, I’m so happy for ye, Sassenach.” He watched her take a big bite of her scone. It was unreasonable for her to look so beautiful while doing it. “What about tomorrow?”“I’m off. I get the rest of today and all of tomorrow. A full 48 hours.”  “What’re ye going to do with yer time?”“I need to adjust, so I’m basically going to be a zombie today and just relax, but stay up, then go to bed early tonight. Frank and I are going to see an early movie and have dinner. No plans for tomorrow, yet.”“I’ve the day off on Tuesday.” Or he would as soon as he spoke to Murtagh. “Anything in mind ye’d like to do?”“Not really. Something outside in the bloody sunlight for once, preferably.”“I’ve an idea. A proper way to celebrate the end of your vampirism, if ye like.”It was still mostly dark at 6:30 in the morning on Tuesday. Jamie and Claire, wearing hiking boots and dressed for the cold, Scottish winter, hiked through the quiet mist.“I can’t believe you talked me into this.” Claire was a little short of breath, but she sounded carefree in her complaint.“Ye love it. It’s so peaceful, eh?”“Yeah, it’s peaceful because we’re the only two mad enough to hike up Arthur’s seat before seven in November.”Jamie laughed, hefted his rucksack higher on his back, and kept on up the trail, Claire close behind him.They reached the summit at 7 o’clock, a good half-hour before sunrise. Jamie led Claire right to the edge of Arthur’s seat and started pulling things out of his bag. Claire spread their picnic blanket onto the cold, dewy ground and sat as Jamie handed her the thermos of tea they were to share. Jamie sat next to her and took a bite of one of the sandwiches he had packed. He had spent the previous evening (while Claire had been out with Frank) making sandwiches and snacks for their sunrise hike.Claire took a swig of tea and handed Jamie the thermos before starting in on her sandwich. “This is lovely. Thank you, Jamie.”“It was no trouble, lass. I love coming up here, especially at sunrise.”“It is a beautiful view.”“Aye.” She looked at the castle, still lit with artificial torches for the night. It was a beautiful and powerful sight, but he preferred to watch her. This was, in an ideal would, what would have been his idea of a perfect date with Claire. Just them in the dark, soon to be bathed in the beauty of sunrise, surrounded by the hills and castles of bonny Scotland. Sometimes he hated himself for his feelings for her – she was his dear friend and he should be happy with that. He was happy with that, and gladly be her friend for the rest of their lives, if that was all he could have with her. Her company, her humour, her smile, her spirit, and the light she brought to his life were more important than his heart that beat more firmly for her with every passing day. Her happiness was more important than his longing. He would be anything to her that she wanted him to be.And yet, he did long for her.She caught his eye and smiled, nudging his shoulder playfully.They turned together to watch the beautiful winter sun come up over Edinburgh Castle.

Creideamh (A missing moment between Jamie x Bree)Set somewhere in the TFC/ABOSSA timeline. Mild spoilers. I want to give 2 small shoutouts. First off to @bonnie-wee-swordsman who was very important to the reason this fic exists. Thank you for being a sounding board and helping flesh out some thoughts about the whole concept of the theme of this fic. And as always, @kkruml for all you do.Sad? Is that what she was? Truthfully, she didn’t really know. How could she be sad over someone who had yet to exist? Of someone… who never even had a heartbeat? Numb. That is how she felt – at least right now. Numb. Void of emotion. Void of feeling. Void of anything. The stream ran cold through her fingers as she rinsed the small pieces of blood stained cloth.  The dark red stains, disappearing into the water, just like the hope she had just a few days before. Gone, in an instant.It wasn’t supposed to be this hard—Hell, it happened so quickly the first time around. This time, it was another story. She could feel the presence of someone behind her—the quiet rustle of the twigs and leaves cracking in the short distance behind her gave her confirmation.Bree finished rinsing the second cloth and rested it on a rock as the shadow from the person behind blocked the sun’s path. “Och,” a familiar voice said behind her. “I am verra sorry, lass. I didna ken ye’d be here….” “Oh.. uhm, it is alright….”  Bree said as she blushed and took her apron off, tossing it over the basket holding the bloody pieces of cloth, covering them. “I was just… Doing a small amount of laundry that is… Er… Rather time sensitive.” She turned to face her father, drying her hands on her skirt and crossing her arms.  Her father’s red hair glowed in the sunlight – the summer air hot on his neck, she could see the sweat dripping from his temples. “Yer mam just needed some more water for something in the surgery. I didna ask any questions.” Jamie said as he held a bucket in one of his hands and shrugged his shoulders. “I just want my supper in a little and did as she told me.”That made her chuckle softly, and she wiped a small tear from the corner of her eye. She watched as her father looked at her and pursed his lips. He opened his mouth a small bit then closed it rapidly, shaking his head. “Out with it. I know you wanted to say something.” Bree said as took a step closer to him taking the bucket out of his hands and turning back to the stream. “Weel…” Jamie started as he sat on a rock near the stream. “It was just earlier… Yer mam made a comment on how ye snapped at her over an herb and stormed off. Seein’ what yer washing here… It just makes sense now, tis all.” Her breath hitched as she released the bucket from her grasp, dropping it on the pebbles on the shore of the stream. “Sorry, Da… I thought I was alone… It’s just…”  She said as the tears came back to her eyes. “I’m sorry… I’m just not quite myself today and Jem is getting another molar. Mama better have some of the good whisky with dinner tonight.”Bree felt her father’s hand on her shoulder as he gave it a light squeeze. “Dinna fash, Bree. I knew ye were late on yer courses…I thought it was because… Well, because that maybe you and Roger Mac wanted another…. But, Claire didna think so…” She stiffened her back a bit and turned her tear stained face to look up at her Da. “Wait… You…. Kept track?” She stammered at him, the temperature in her cheeks rising.

House of Fraser, Chpter 1 - Helwater Fashions Prompt from @thekingparrot Jamie Fraser is a fashion designer at a London fashion house. He is in a relationship with Geneva Dunsany which is in difficulty.Claire Beauchamp is engaged to Frank Randall, who is a rich businessman keen to impress his fellow company directors and shareholders. He wants a high profile wedding just before Christmas, so he arranges for Claire to have a wedding gown designed by Jamie. In order to make a carefully fitted gown, Jamie arranges a number of personal fittings.Click clack click. James Fraser looked up from his vintage drafting table.Clack click clack.Jamie put on his glasses and examined two swatches of fabric to his left. Clack clack CLICK  Jamie knew there was no way to avoid the maelstrom.  He turned just in time to see his girlfriend of near to three years barge into his design studio on the outskirts of London. “Did you see this!?” demanded Geneva Dunsany. Her outstretched arm held an iPad Pro. Jamie already knew what he was to look at. James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser had just survived his first season as a lead designer for William – the couture division of one of the world’s great fashion houses, Helwater Fashions (HF).Geneva impatiently shook the tablet in the doorway.   Reluctantly, Jamie rose to meet her. His stride momentarily faltered when he saw her outfit. It was the definition of unflattering; too short, wrong color, wrong season, too tight and the shoes. The shoes were 4.5 inch stilettos for which the cliché money cannot buy class was invented. Frustrated by his slow progress, Geneva click clacked her stilettos on the cement floor until she reached Jamie. “Who the hell does he think he is?” She was indignant.Jamie grabbed the iPad. “G, it’s only a bad review. One bad review out of dozens. Black Jack loves to be a contrarian.”  “But he’s so influential! Look at what he wrote, ‘With James Fraser, the once strong English brand has rolled into the muck and peat to create a vision devoid of passion, life, or aspiration.’” Jamie smiled. They’d met at Paris fashion week three years earlier. Jamie had been trying and failing to find entrée into the exclusive world of high fashion. Surprisingly, his looks has been the biggest hindrance. No one believed a farm raised Highland Scot, built like a Viking warrior, would possess the sensitivity required to design at such a level.Jamie had chanced upon Geneva outside a Paris bar. A bar serving as a pre party location for all the important players in fashion. After a brief conversation, the two entered a pack of mutual assistance. Geneva, the great granddaughter of HF’s founder and junior marketing director, needed to prove her mettle, and Jamie needed a chance. They’d been together ever since.Jamie knew their relationship wasn’t a great love affair. He preferred it that way. In this business he’d seen many a passionate person laid low by the fickleness of the heart. They had an arrangement.  Jamie trusted Geneva to do right by the art; the art he weaved through fabric.  And what was that, but a form of love?Lately, however, Geneva had been disrespecting their division of labor. She was increasingly encroaching on his creative process.Jamie reached to comfort her. She immediately flinched back - batting at his hands as though they were a swarm of irritating midges. Jamie sighed. Sometimes he wished she was more comfortable with affection - giving and receiving.“Did John forward you the Randall proposal?” Geneva was on to the next topic.“Aye.” Was she determined to completely sour his mood?John Grey was Jamie’s assistant and life saver. He kept the day to day running so Jamie could focus on the clothes. He often served as a buffer between Geneva. John would weed out her more ridiculous suggestions, such a line of tartan clothing covered with representations of haggis, kelpies, Nessie and Burns’ quotes.  Jamie literally had nightmares over that one. But, John had actually passed the Randall proposal to Jamie.“And?”“Aye, I looked at it. But a wedding dress? HF has never done weddings. And I’m ‘no sure I’m interested.”Geneva began to speak slowly as though Jamie were a simpleton. “Fraser, everyone who is anyone will be at this wedding. Celebrities. Politicians. Royalty. Business people. Influencers!”  She stepped closer, put a hand to his chest, and stuck out her bottom lip in an exaggerated pout.If this would keep her away from his new designs, it would be worth the trouble.“Fine. Fine. I’ll have another look.” “Brilliant! Because Randall and his fiancée will be here Thursday at 2. I’ll tell John. Cheers!”Jamie felt his temper flare. “Geneva you canna—“ “Mr. Fraser, what do you think about paisley? Too on the nose?” Jamie’s intern, Jeremy Foster entered carrying fabrics.  The interruption was enough for Geneva to escape.   She blew a kiss over her shoulder as she click clacked down the hall. ****Jamie stood at the kitchen counter of his London flat.  He’d prepared himself a simple meal of grilled rosemary chicken and steamed vegetables. He could think better when he stood. His habit of eating while standing drove Geneva mad. He smiled to himself, almost wishing she could see him now, but thankfully neither had ever broached the topic of living together. His laptop was open to Frank Randall’s wikipedia page. Jamie knew of Randall. Everyone knew of the man. A venture capitalist who made his money in the pharmaceutical and green energy industries. He’d recently started his own company to produce homes and cars that ran completely from solar power. The IPO was rumored to be right after Christmas. And Randall’s wedding was set two days before Christmas. Hmm. That would give Jamie just over three months to  design the gown. He still wasn’t sold on the idea, but the potential benefits were undeniable. So were the risks.  Jamie typed Frank Randall fiancée into he search engine.  There were hits about the wedding, Frank Randall and his company, but no picture and no name of his bride.Odd.  He then tried Frank Randall girlfriend. No hits. HmmJamie opened Randall’s proposal. It contained the wedding announcement. There he found her name at least— Claire Elizabeth Beauchamp.

            Loss Ficlet: Pearls        This is the last of the Summer of Smut. This little project has been such a joy – in large because I have been able to get to know @smashing-teacups and @desperationandgin so well. It has been fun having these two as sidekicks for this lusty, crazy project. I hope that you guys have enjoyed reading along as much as we have enjoyed writing these stories! xx.Special thanks to Danielle, @notevenjokingfic and @lcbeauchampoftarth for putting some eyes on this for me and giving me some clutch advice.;nsfw beneath the cutLoss FicletPearlsAugust 2017(Jamie POV)↳ Soundtrack: Black Match - Same Old Things [have you ever seen heaven, even in a daydream?]
Loving Claire was easy, but loving Claire in the unusually broiling heat of our second summer together was like tasting sun-melted, salted caramel after a lifetime of parritch and bannocks.  Making love to her on those pliant, sweaty nights made a fantastical part of me believe it possible to absorb the energy of the high August sun, harness it, and let it vaporize my good sense.  Muddling through the moments after release with light heads and drifting fingertips, we painted our afterglow on her bedding, lifting the duvet over our heads only when she whimpered about being chilly. 
Claire in the summer drove with the windows down, her arm riding invisible waves and the outline of her wide-eyes filled with a boundless kind of joy that grew as we descended deeper and deeper into the season.  She sang ‘Brown-Eyed Girl’ at the top of her lungs, fingers turning the knob on the car radio and body straining against her seatbelt to dance freely (shoulders leading first, the scent of early freesias blooming from her hair).  
At the start of the weekend, she shed her clothes in the entryway of our flat. After we got our baser needs met and the attendant cleanup out of our way, she would put on nothing more than one of my t-shirts. And she would stay thus clothed until the next round.  
Her summer drink of choice was gin. Ice cold and straight from the freezer, she adorned it with crushed basil (plucked from the rectangular planter of unruly herbs on our windowsill) and macerated strawberries or fat slices of hydroponic cucumbers.  She declared herself a mixologist with her eyes closed, sweating tumbler in hand. Half drunk and freshly showered, she later found me reading on the balcony.  Wordlessly, she settled onto my lap and glanced at the veritable jungle of sweet potato vine obscuring us from view as she carefully unzipped my pants and settled the soft, wet heat of herself against me.  “I was thinking about this moment – about you – when I planted this spring.”
Loving Claire had always been easy.  I had loved Claire when she showed up to that distillery, tended to my arm, and walked away from me in a pub, brazenly swaying her fat arse. I had loved her the first time I brought her home, and each subsequent time she appeared at my doorstep. But in the summer it was simple.  I loved her when we moved in together, when we had arguments (over organic blueberries and rinsing out recyclables and how much to spend on one another for Christmas).

Also special thanks to @the-fear-you-wont-fall who held my hand as I wrote this chapter!1 Year AgoJamieThe one that’s an accidentJamie Fraser was a stubborn man. He knew it himself. Hell, Jenny- his sister- consistently reminded him time and time again.One thing he knew down to the very marrow of his bones- he was in love with Claire Beauchamp.He had accidentally asked her out- almost without realizing it himself. He had stumbled in from work, a bunch of papers for the company’s project in his hands, and dropped them on the couch. She had stumbled out, her hair wrapped turban-like above her head, and a facemask on.“Bad day?” Claire had asked, meandering through to the kitchen and pouring herself a glass of whisky. He nodded, striding across the room taking a seat on the barstool.  “Ye could say so.” Jamie reached in front of him, taking her glass and swallowing the contents in one large gulp. “Damn.” Claire laughed, pouring him another. “Want to get out of here for the night, I ken a place that’s not sae far from here. A hole in the wall little diner. They serve great waffles.” Jamie shrugged his shoulders trying ot shake the day off and ran his fingers through his hair.  Claire laughed, nodding at him. “Give me five to tame these medusa curls and throw some clothes on.” Keep reading

I’ll be there for you, Chapter 6 (previously)@kkruml thank you for all you do, you’re the best, ily.1-Year AgoClaireI sat across from him in the booth. “The Diner” was where he had taken me for a late night snack or our version of dinner. There was a neon sign plastered on the outside window that flashed, “Open Crazy Late.” The minute we had walked in, the old jubilant server smiled from ear to ear praising my roommate. “Och, my wee Jamie, yer back!” Jamie had nodded to a booth over in the corner and then walked to the front counter, kissing the woman on the cheek before sliding in across from me. “And who is that?” I asked taking a menu from behind the salt. “That would be Mrs. Crook- she’s the owner’s wife, basically runs the place, ye ken?”  Jamie looked at me amused and crossed his arms. “I ken,” I laughed giving him a confused look, “why are you looking at me like that?” “Because this is not the kind of place where ye order, Sassenach. It is the kind of place where Mrs. Crook gives ye what ye want, it’s why there are no’ menu on the tables.” Keep reading

Deepest gratitude to @lcbeauchampoftarth for her amazing energy and mad beta skills, and to @notevenjokingfic for giving this chapter some love.

I’m lucky to have these talented gals willing to give it to me straight.;nsfw under the cutOne SummerPart XI: Ben Nevis &amp; Loch Lomond
The Highlands never really descended into a genuine midnight dark.  Even in the deepest recesses of the night, a dusky glow lurked at the horizon like pesky metropolitan light pollution, preventing velvet-black from framing the backside of the moon.  But the haze of light wasn’t the side effect of urbanization – it was a product of being this far north.  To Claire, it always felt like it was shortly before dawn here.  Here was the place that she had come to call the end of the earth.  And when she woke the morning after her Netflix and Advil date with Fraser – a bit achy, but mostly just exhausted – that dim, distant illumination meant she had no idea what time it was. 
After she slammed the first of the day’s ibuprofen dosings, Claire turned to the man slumbering beside her. Jamie was curled up on top of the covers, one foot dangling off the edge of the mattress, a pillow clutched to his chest, and a slim line of drool glistening on his chin.  Her heart galloped as she came to the belated realization that she was carrying on whatever this was with not just the sexiest man she had ever been with, but the sexiest man she had ever seen. And he wasn’t just sexy, good in bed, and well-endowed, he was kind and generous.  He was thoughtful and helpful – hell, he’d refrained from commenting on her lack of dumpster as he hauled construction debris down the stairs, offering to send an email “to a mate to have one delivered” like it was no big deal.
Shaking her head, Claire internally lamented the fact that at some point she would have to face the reality that she needed to find a new job and return to her life.
Those were concerns for another day.
For now, she would concern herself only with the small kindness of wiping the drool off Jamie Fraser’s chin.

ScalamandreChapter 1This is a multi-chapter modern AU following a scientist and a mountaineer, trying to stop the men behind the madness that has taken over the world.AO3The muscles in Claire’s arms strained, pulled
taut, and her fingertips went numb, slipping inch by inch until she hung by
almost nothing. Her vision narrowed to the man clinging to a hook on the door,
swinging his boot down upon her hands. Pain shot up her arm, stealing her
breath, as he crushed her nails, the bones of her fingers shattering. He needn’t have bothered doing it. She would
have fallen in a few seconds had he waited, but he didn’t wait. And because of
his final action, when she did fall, her arms flailing wildly in the air
grasping at nothing, she imagined the satisfying crunch of her boot upon his
face when she found him again. Her final moments, before her body shattered
upon the rocky ground, were of panic, terror, and vengeance. After her spine
split, vertebrae crushed into dust, her eyes opened to blue eyes above her,
rimmed with tears. His red hair fell forward, tickling her skin as he shook
over her body. “Dinna leave me.” Keep reading
