        yiffmaster:snarp:“CHEESED BURGER” IS JUST “WIGAN KEBAB” WITH THE STARCH AND MEAT CONFIGURED SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY, AND ALSO, CHEESEok i guess every single meat and bread meal is the same. a hotdog is just a calzone. a ham &amp; cheese is just a pie. a pizza is just a ravioli. i feel like i’m knocking on your front door to yell at you and i don’t enjoy it but this is foolish and i implore you to reconsider your words and actionschill out yiffmaster pizza is a sandwich
