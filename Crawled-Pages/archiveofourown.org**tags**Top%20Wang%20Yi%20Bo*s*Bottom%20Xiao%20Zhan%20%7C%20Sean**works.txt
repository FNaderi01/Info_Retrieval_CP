    Summary
      “Red. Definitely red.”“Jiejie, of course we’re going with red but don’t you think a suit will fit them more?”“Aiya, Meimei. Red suits will be too much, ah!” Xiao Mama says, leaning back in her seat. “My ZhanZhan is always a traditional boy at heart so a changsan will fit him more. I’m sure your YiBo will also look dashing in a matching set. What do you think, Meimei? I know this tailor at home--”“No need ah. They will get married in the city so it will be too troublesome if the tailor is in your hometown. Leave it to Meimei.” Wang Mama says as she nods her head firmly.

    Summary
      The bright sun filled the hotel room, together with the laughter and jokes shared by the three handsome boys sat together around the tiny table chatting about life. It was an exhausting day for them after spending hours and hours filming for SDC, and finally after so many months they could spend a few days resting and enjoying themselves. The younger man was telling the others about his new skateboard and how he was learning new tricks on it...his eyes were sparkling and he did not even stop to take a breath. However, even though his eyes were sparkling and he seemed happy, there was something in his expressions that just people extremely close to him would notice. The problem is that not even that man himself could realize his true feelings and buried all his emotions deep in his aching heart. Well...at least until a familiar song start playing in the radio and the happiness and laughs from that room were replaced with watery eyes and tears falling down his cheeks.So this is heartache?All this pain in the chest, my regrets, and things we never said...What me meant, what we said that night,why did i let you go?            I miss you

      "Make three wishes before blowing the candles, say the first two wishes aloud and don't forget to keep your third wish a secret. " They said holding the cake. 
"My third wish is YOU. It is To See You Again. " Yibo said closing his eyes. 
....................................................
"Are these paintings done by you? " The lady asked. 
"Yes. " Zhan replied with a smile. 
"The next painting that you do, will be your masterpiece that'll change your life. " The lady walked off after saying that. 
.................................................. 
"Is HE nothing, but just a part of my DREAM? " Zhan asked as tears rolled down his eyes. 
"Please tell me it isn't true... Because I want To See You Again. " Zhan said in a desperate voice. 
...................................................
I want to experience that DREAM again. I want To See You Again. 
I miss you, my only desire is To See You Again.
