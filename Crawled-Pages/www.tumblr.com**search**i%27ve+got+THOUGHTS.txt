what i love about ace attorney is how natural the character development can be, because the games are played out over such a long in-game time period. in a normal story the character development happens because someone has an epiphany and is forced to change, but in ace attorney the development can happen because you‚Äôre just getting older! maya‚Äôs not a kid anymore! phoenix isn‚Äôt the optimistic, naive art student, miles softens over time because sometimes we do that as we grow older. they‚Äôre all adjusting to the real world from who they used to be and they‚Äôre growing!! babe that‚Äôs real, actual, growth, and growth doesn‚Äôt always happen through epiphanies, sometimes it happens through facing the hard truth and sometimes it happens from letting people love you.

few things i want from season 5 on the klance side: keith and lance admitting they miss each other lance confronting keith about what he was about to do in the s4 finale plus telling him about his suspicions towards shiro lance asking keith if the conversation they had in s3 influenced his decision to leave the team an hUG(i mean frankly all of this can happen in one big conversation between them)

gertrude made the active choice not to trust anyone after being betrayed by her assistant, though it was partly her own inaction and callousness that lead to the deaths of the other assistants. she decided she‚Äôd rather have tools than confidantes.jon made the active choice to trust people after realizing he‚Äôd hurt his assistants through his paranoia and distrust, both as colleagues and as friends. he decided that he‚Äôd rather trust them, whatever the cost, than push them away further. and he was never, ever careless with their lives.

‚ÄúI know that she spent her childhood in exile, impoverished, living on dreams and schemes, running from one city to the next, always fearful, never safe, friendless but for a brother who was by all accounts half-mad‚Ä¶a brother who sold her maidenhood to the Dothraki for the promise of an army. I know that somewhere upon the grass, her dragons hatched, and so did she. I know she is proud. How not? What else was left her but pride? I know she is strong. How not? The Dothraki despise weakness. If Daenerys had been weak, she would have perished with Viserys. I know she is fierce. Astapor, Yunkai and Meereen are proof enough of that. She has survived assassins and conspiracies and fell sorceries, grieved for a brother and a husband and a son, trod the cities of the slavers to dust beneath her dainty sandaled feet.‚Äù ¬† ¬† ¬† - Tyrion Lannister (A Dance with Dragons) by George R.R. Martin

            Main 6¬†and Their Weird Sleeping Positions        Asra - Yes hello, they are the lord of
the pillow pile and they are not ashamed of it. They sleep on their
side, one pillow between their legs, one locked securely in their
arms, one under their head, and one pillow up against their back.
They can‚Äôt explain exactly why the back pillow is necessary, it just
is and they can‚Äôt sleep without it.Julian - When he actually manages sleep
he curls in on himself to much he halves in size. His heels touch his
butt, his knees are up to his chin, and his arms cross over his chest
so tight its almost as though he‚Äôs trying to disappear into himself.
He even tucks his face into his knees to be as small as possible.
Also, will 100% disappear under the blankets.Nadia - Straight up looks like she‚Äôs
been positioned by a funeral home when she sleeps. On her back, legs
straight out and pressed together, one arm across her stomach with
the other straight beside her. Her hair is immaculately positioned on
the pillow and her head doesn‚Äôt even loll to one side. Is that a
mannequin or the Countess? The world may never know.Portia - Ever heard of the Starfish?
Well this girl does the Octopus. Limbs? Everywhere. Hair? Everywhere.
Some of those contortions shouldn‚Äôt even be humanly possible but
there she is with her chest facing one way and her head facing the
other. The position is never consistent but the impossibility always
stays the same. ¬†Owns a pillow but her head is never on it.Muriel - On his side, with his back as
tightly pressed to the wall as it can possibly be. He doesn‚Äôt curl
up, he stays completely board straight parallel to the wall, except
for his arms. His arms are stretched straight out in front of him, as
through reaching for something. The position itself isn‚Äôt all that
impressive, but the rhythmic grabby motion of his hands certainly is.
All night with the grabby hands.Lucio - This man sleeps on his stomach.
You know that crazy Sailor Moon-esque pose people do? Yep, that‚Äôs it.
He‚Äôs got one leg stretched out and the other one curled up, with his
left arm tucked under his pillow. Where is his right arm you ask?
Pinned under his body completely with his hand securely tucked into
his groin. To keep the goods safe of course.
