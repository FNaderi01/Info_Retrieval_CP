    Summary
      This was a story about two people that were never meant to meet. Their families were enemies and they were unaware of it which meant later destruction. A man who had it all was quick to lose it when he caught his soon to be wife cheating on him with his best man and long term friend. He committed a gruesome double degree murder which triggers a series of mental illnesses he's kept hidden away for years and doing so to cover his bloody tracks it led him to meet a woman, who didn't really look much like a woman, granted or in his case, cursed him with immortality. Over a century later and many attempts at suicide, he decides to turn himself into the police. But instead of locking him away in prison, they send him to a psychiatric hospital for the mentally insane where he meets a lady doctor whom he soon becomes obsessed with.
