    Summary
      It’s Tuesday night, which means long hours of writing, or in Chris’s case, goofing around while David tries to write. David, however, can’t write, because the goofball behind him is such a huge distraction.

    Summary
      “Kylo Ren. I am aware that you have just returned from a rather long escapade and you most likely wish to rest. However, I have a new mission for you. I believe there is a traitor on board. I want you to disguise yourself as a crew member and investigate.” Kylo nodded dutifully albeit hesitantly. He utterly despised the idea, the mere suggestion that his face would be bared to the world, that he wouldn't have his helmet to shield him. But he did not convey this to Snoke, instead bowing respectfully and setting out to begin his task.

  Bowen has long outgrown his desire to sleep with assholes, but he's not going to make it if Harry Styles is as nice as they say. He keeps falling (and falling, and falling) for Harry's breed of take-him-home-to-mother twink. The kind of boy your family hears about once before he jet-sets off to Milan or wherever to go do a residency at a tiger sanctuary.
OrHarry Styles comes to SNL.

      Crush him! Enact revenge for everything he’s done to our family! You are strong, Kylo Ren! Do not falter! 
With the voice of his grandfather’s ghost whispering in his ears, Kylo surveyed the ballroom before him. The Naboo Annual Philanthropy Gala was underway, full of preening elites in their finery, all hoping to outdo each other. None of them shone as brightly as her.

    Summary
      Rey has never really thought about having a ‘type’ before, but she can’t say that she likes Randy's stringy blonde hair or his ragged little goatee.  She’s not even sure he really likes her; not that the long, auburn wig does her any favors, but Randy wasn’t exactly throwing himself at her feet before she started dragging him into a supply closet every Wednesday afternoon during the pickup run. She can’t say what it is about him.  Maybe it’s just that they’ve got some energy to burn and they both hate their jobs.

      Rey has had a crush on her Science Teacher Professor Zachary Adams since forever but he has always resisted her temptations... until now... 
**********
In my mind Rey is a sixth form student (UK higher education) and is aged 18 or 19. 
**********
He slammed his hands down on the desk and turned to face her. 
‘Updating? Are you implying that my teaching methods are old fashioned, Ms Johnson?’ 
‘Yes I am. You’re an old fashioned kind of guy, Professor Adams.’ 
She moved closer and whispered her next words.
‘And I find that incredibly appealing.’

    Summary
      He takes the cup from her gently, and she knows the part is coming that wrecks her the most. He brings it to his mouth carefully, never tearing his gaze from hers as he takes a slow sip. He always fucking smiles when she gets it right—and why is she so pleased when he does? She feels like some sort of touch-starved Yorkie who’s just praying that master gives her a bone. 
Randy gives her a quiet thank you, turning to carry his coffee from the shop and strolling out the door. Rey takes a deep breath as she moves to busy herself with the next order, thinking to herself that she really needs to get laid.
Just not by Randy.
  In which Randy the Intern can't stop overcomplicating his coffee order, and Rey can't stop wishing he'd just order her instead.

      As if reading his mind, Louis glanced over his glasses at Harry, presumably because Harry didn't reply to his statement earlier.    "I decided to get my glasses out again," he chuckled, winking at Harry. "Do you like them?"  Harry felt his face heat up. No, he didn't just like them. He fucking loved them and wanted to ride Louis and call him daddy while he wore them. But he didn't want to just tell Louis this. Or Louis wears glasses and Harry doesn't like to be teased
