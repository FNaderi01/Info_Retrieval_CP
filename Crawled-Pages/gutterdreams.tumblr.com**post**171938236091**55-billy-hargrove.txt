                                                            “I think my boyfriend’s an anarchist.” / Requests are closed“He’s a fucking tool.” Billy raged.
There was a moment of pause where he didn’t say a word only so that
he could properly let out an aggravated groan before palming his hand
as hard as he could into the wheel. This wasn’t the first time Billy
had gone on a long-winded and insult-laced tangent before. They were
usually directed over the same few people, but he was adding Hawkins
high school history teacher, Mr. Mellon to his list. You figured that
the senior  probably had no idea he had just made an enemy out of one
of Billy Hargrove. “I can’t even punch him, too, you know? That’s
the shittiest part.”	“Is it?” You joked from the
passenger seat, asking the question from one corner of your mouth. It
wasn’t as if Billy was really looking to you for advice.	“He would die. He’s a 100.”	“He turned 77 in January.” You
added and instantly felt the burn of your boyfriend’s glare against
your jawline. “Sorry.” Eyes wide for just a nanosecond, you
tossed him a very light apology. You remembered seeing the teachers
eating birthday cake the first week back after winter break.	“Fucking Mellon. He has it out for
me!”	“You didn’t turn in your assignment,
Billy.”	“So? He can’t hold me back because
of that.”	“He can and he just threatened to. I
think he’s trying to light fire under your ass.” You rolled your
head off of the window it was resting on. Max chose a bad day to be
late coming out of school. Sighing, you looked over your pissed off
boyfriend and half-expected steam to rush out of his nostrils.	“I’d like to light him on fire.”
Billy cursed automatically. “And his house. Does he have a dog?”
He watched you shake your head. “Good, I don’t want to do something
to the dog, but I’d steal it or dye it blue or something.”	In return, you said ‘nothing’. Billy
had gone to such a strange place with his frustration that you
couldn’t follow him into the darkness. You just stood with your
bottom lip slightly dropped and eyes dilated with worry.	“What?” Finally changing his train
of thought, he chirped at you. “What is it?” He looked behind
himself, thinking you must have been looking at some junior high kid
doing something weird in the parking lot you were both waiting.	“I think my boyfriend’s an
anarchist.” Very slowly, but clearly, you let out each word. Your
eyes didn’t change at all as you stared past Billy’s face and focused
on nothing. 	“I’m not going to light him on
fire!” Billy rolled his eyes and tossed his head back against the
headrest. He noticed the time and felt his teeth knock together out
of anger towards Max. What was taking her so long? You were too busy
shutting your mouth around the realization that you actually needed
to hear from Billy that he wasn’t going to light the history teacher
on fire. “We could egg his car though. Your mom bakes, you got
eggs….”	Leaning in close, licking your lips
and shimmied your shoulders, you started to draw Billy in for a kiss.
As soon as he was close enough to smell the nicotine on his breath,
you shook your head, “No! No vandalism! No destruction of property!
No!” You called into his face and then leaned back down in your
seat.	“You never let me have revenge.”
It was both the best and worst thing about having you as a
girlfriend.

Also wedding and grad season is just a busy time of year for me, but I have not stopped with Billy stories. Just tending to life stuff at the moment. Hope you’re all well.
