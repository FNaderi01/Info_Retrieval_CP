    Summary
      He hated his wings. They were a reminder of how he’d shielded Izzy on her first mission instead of finishing the threat as he should have. A reminder of how soft and fragile Max had been in his arms when he was born.
A reminder of what he would do for his parabatai. Laws be damned.
The Law is hard, but it is the Law.
For Nephilim the decent into hell is easy. For the winged it was even easier.

    Summary
      “Here you go, darling.” Magnus said, handing over the salt, his legs swinging on the counter. His smile was knowing and flirtatious.Alec swallowed and took the salt, his hands brushing against the warlocks fingers and his rings.“Thank you.” he simply replied, turning around quickly so Magnus wouldn’t be able to see his flushed face.“What about you?” Magnus now wanted to know, his tone light and conversational. “Well,” Alec started, his brain coming back to the food he was cooking. What did he have to do next? “Um, the uh… We had a demon nest near the Institute and one of them tried to get through the wards…”Alec trailed off when Magnus hopped off the counter, his steps light on the floor as he stood behind Alec, his body pressing against his.Magnus’ hands went around Alec and reached towards the pan that was before Alec and he took the spoon, stirring the mix and adding the tomato paste.“Oh?” Magnus asked, his breath tickling Alec’s neck.Right, yes, that was the next step.//[Day 10 of Flufftober 2020, Cooking]

Each chapter is based on a song in the album (13 total, excluding Giants, which was added later in 2020).Alec and Magnus navigating their relationship and the emotional ups and downs that go with that, told in alternating POVs. There's some canon-typical angst, but ultimately a collection of fics depicting soft boyfriends (to soft husbands) who love each other dearly.

    Summary

    Summary
      “Come on,” Magnus stretched out a hand for Alec to grab. Alec took it, holding it tight, and stood up. “Are you going to go back home to grab your clothes?”“I was thinking…” Magnus said,  “...that I could borrow some of your clothes.”Alec shook his head and smiled. “Just so you can never return them again?”“Hey, I gave you your hoodie back last week, didn’t I?” Magnus pouted, then started to walk towards the house, without letting go of Alec’s hand. It was moments like these that made his brain flooded with thoughts, the way Magnus didn’t let go of Alec’s hand and how their enclasped palms swung between them as they walked. It might seem like a small gesture. They have walked hand-in-hand before, and Magnus probably didn’t even think anything of it. But it still never failed to make Alec question: Would Magnus ever want this as more than friends? Or: Alec would be lying if he said that winter wasn't his favorite part of the year. More specifically, Magnus cuddled up to his side as snow falls behind the window. Just him and his best friend, who he's totally not in love with.[Flufftober day 9, Snowy Day]

    Summary
      "So," Izzy asks, lounging on the sofa in the loft. "Have you told Mags the story of your gay awakening yet?"Alec chokes, and beside him Magnus waves a ringed hand, and pouts. "He's been dreadfully tight-lipped about it, I'm afraid."

    Summary
      Alec Lightwood’s life in his small village is simple, his purpose straightforward: he spends his days in the nearby forest hunting for wild game, and his nights at home caring for his mother and siblings.He does not remain in the forest after dark.Then, Alec’s brother Jace is arrested. When Jace is sentenced to indentured servitude in the long-abandoned castle at the center of the forest, Alec has no choice but to present himself to serve in his brother's stead—Jace has a new mate, who would suffer greatly in his absence. Their whole family would.No one would miss Alec.At his father’s behest, Alec takes his brother’s place and, with it, a new purpose: root out the secrets hidden within the dark, crumbling castle in the woods, and use them to bring its mysterious owner, Magnus Bane, to ruin.

    Summary
      Still blindly following Clave orders, Alec infuriates Magnus and gets kicked out of the loft.  Magnus nurses his emotional wounds and Dot shows up. Lots of vodka, emotional upheaval, and recently compromised state with Azazael lead the doorway open for an unwelcome visit from one of Magnus's many uncles, A Prince of Hell, Greater Demon Samael -- with a personal agenda against Magnus and everything he holds dear.  Alec unwittingly gets caught in the middle. This doesn't bode well for either of them in the (tumultous) aftermath.Canon divergent season 2 episode 13CHAPTER 20 UPDATED

    Summary
      Cómo se consigue la felicidad cuando uno mismo la niega? Cuando no se está seguro de ser digno de encontrarla? Cómo lograr abrir el corazón a riesgo de terminar en pedazos una vez más? Cómo saber si ese sentimiento que nace de repente y revoluciona absolutamente todo lo que creías cierto es real o una mera ilusión creada por el instinto de un Omega que espera ese Alfa que fue hecho exactamente a su medida? Ese que al entrar en su vida cambiará cada aspecto que él creía que lo definía? Ese que logre apartarlo del camino vacío de solo buscar la compañía en un cuerpo cálido por una noche, de vivir aventura tras aventura, sin arriesgarse a sufrir, a formar un vínculo que puede significar que toda tu vida termine de cabeza?Estas eran las preguntas que el Gran Brujo de Brooklyn, Magnus Bane, no podía dejar de hacerse desde hace unos días, cuando en un enfrentamiento inesperado conoció a un hombre misterioso, con un aroma intoxicante, fuerte, dulce, irresistible…pero esquivo e intrigante.

    Summary
      Alec Lightwood. Everyone knows the name. He's the heinous mob leader that runs his city ruthlessly. He has no love in his heart after his terrible bringing up into the world. He's digging himself a grave from how hard and vindictive he is about his work. The only thing that could help him is love. But the only love he has is for his siblings and his mother. It's what he needs to save him. True love from another man. But who could love a literal killer? Well, someone does come. When Alec's subordinates accidentally kidnap the wrong person, a broken down teacher and writer named Magnus, Alec can't let him leave. Not only because he's injured gruesomely, but because Magnus is more than just some teacher. Apparently, he is a huge playing card in the life of the cabals.The more that the two spent together, the more that they realize that there is so many things about each other that they can solve. That they have in common. And now that they have come together, they don't want to let go.🥀

    Summary
      “Sam,” trench coat gave the tall guy a look, a look telling him to stop, “This is Dean and Sam Winchester and I’m Castiel.”Castiel, as he called himself, had an unreadable expression on his face. Weird and cold, but his tone was curious.“They are hunters. I’m an Angel of the Lord,” he continued, slowly.There were a few seconds of silence, Alec frowning at the supposed angel. They kept saying they were hunters, as if that was supposed to make sense. Finally, Magnus clicked his tongue. “Alec, darling. I think they’re not from here.” he said quietly, pulling at Alec’s sleeve. Alec eyed him.“No shit.” said Alec crudely. Magnus rolled his eyes.“I mean, not from this universe.” the warlock clarified. Alec’s mouth hung open slightly. “Oh,” he said.//A Shadowhunters meets Supernatural AU story.

    Summary
      Imogen Herondale hated Alec Lightwood. Everyone from Jia Penhallow all the way through Jace himself knew of her animosity towards the person that she felt held her grandson back from the all that the Herondale name deserved. Despite this, Alec never thought she would actually move against him because to hurt him was to hurt Jace. He had been wrong. Now, Alec had no runes. His memories were gone. He had no idea who he was, why there was a ragged wound inside of him that he couldn't see or how he had gotten to this abandoned apartment in San Francisco. All he knew was that monsters were tracking him and staying alive might take more strength than he had.

    Summary
      “I woke up alone, so I thought you…” Magnus trailed off“Hey,” Alec pressed a kiss on the top of Magnus’ head and murmured against his hair, “I didn’t… I took a day off today. I didn’t want to disturb you last night.” he sighed, “What time is it?”“Almost 1 pm,” Magnus replied. “Your long legs couldn’t have been comfortable here”Alec shook his head lightly. “I managed.” He felt Magnus smile against his neck. “I’m sorry.” Magnus murmured. “About what I said last night. I didn’t mean to…” he trailed off, “...yell”It was the spell, Alec knew. But the spell only made Magnus lose his patience, the words were still his. Still valid and standing. 'I fear we’re growing apart and I hate it' Or: The shadow world can be stressful and nosy seelie spells lead buried frustrations to flame out. But there's nothing a few cuddles and a soft talk can't fix, right?[Flufftober Day 6, Hurt/Comfort]

    Summary
      “I know what you’re doing. It’s not gonna happen, Magnus.” Alec whispered next to his ear and Magnus shivered involuntarily. Damn it, he was supposed to be the one doing the seducing.“I have no idea what you’re talking about, darling.” Magnus tried to say innocently, his lips still attached to Alec’s pale skin, just above a rune.Alec shook his head. “You’ll see the costume tomorrow.” was all he said.“But, Alexander,” Magnus practically whined, giving up on his actions and pouting at his boyfriend.Alec laughed again and the sound was brilliant and pure. He put a finger under Magnus’ chin, lifting his gaze to meet Alec’s. The shadowhunter smiled at him before he leaned down.“You can wait for me, can’t you?” he asked against the warlock's lips and Magnus felt himself finally give in.“Do I have a choice?”//Or, Magnus is dying to know what Alec's Halloween costume is, and Alec is surprisingly good at keeping it a secret.[Day 5 of Flufftober 2020, Celebration]

    Summary
      Despite the fact that Izzy was still there, Alec went up to Magnus and touched the back of his hand with his fingers. Magnus looked up, confusion reflecting in his eyes.“I was about to have a panic attack, I’m pretty sure. You helped me get through it. Before you start taking the blame, consider this - maybe I wanted you to kiss me.” Alec could hear Isabelle make a surprised noise, but he didn’t care. He waited.Magnus’ eyes grew wider and he stared down at their hands, that Alec had now linked.“To answer Isabelle,” Alec then went on, turning to his sister “I do think we should stop. Because I don’t want to fake-date you. It’s hard, it’s frustrating and it’s killing me because I’m lying if I say that I don’t want it to be real.”//[Day 4 of Flufftober 2020, Fake Dating] // Sorry this was so short xxPS!

    Summary
      “What do you think?” Alec asked Magnus as he stared up at his boyfriend. 
“You’re a winner in my eyes, babe, but I’d love to wipe that smug look off your brother’s face.” he said cheerfully and Alec laughed, leaning to peck his lips. When Alec etched closer to the table, he turned around, making the crowd gasp slightly.
Lily made an exaggerated ‘ooooooooooh’ sound. 
Alec just had to make this one shot, backwards, and they’d win, no matter that there were two cups left. It was their only shot, considering that Jace and Simon had only one cup to go and they’d surely get it.
Alec looked at Magnus, who stood opposite to him. He smiled at his boyfriend, studying the wicked glint in his eyes. Alec winked and Magnus blew him a kiss.
When the ball landed into the cup, the crowd erupted into chaos and Lily jumped onto Alec, hugging him and cheering. Magnus laughed, with Raphael saying ‘Okay, so you weren’t terrible’.
