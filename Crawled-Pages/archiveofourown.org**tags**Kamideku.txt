    Summary
      When Mina steps into the dining room, she howls and points accusingly at Denki for ‘stinking’ up the dormitory.Denki is at loss of words because technically, he did just do that. He was claiming his territory.OR the A/B/O Verse fic that no one asked for. But I had to indulged in myself.

    Summary
      “Well there is only one way to find out right? Is anyone else here?” They waited. Nothing. After a minute Shouta went up to the black board and erased the message. He didn’t notice the chalk floating next to him until it clicked on the board. 	Quickly backing up to a safer distance he and the principal watched as the chalk started to write on the board. It was simple and quick, yet the chalk kept hovering next to the word. Yes! …“I don’t get paid enough for this.”----A.K.A That one where Izuku Midoriya is dead...? and haunting the halls of U.A. :)

    Summary
      Nobody really knows when exactly they had started talking, let alone even look at one another.Some say they started talking because of Kaminari's random comment, and Midoriya's completely humorous answer.KamiDekuKaminari Denki '' Midoriya IzukuOne of my many Deku pairings.Def. One of my favorite Deku pairings.This story is all over the fucking placeYou've been warned.This fanfic is based completely off of fucking Tumblr posts of all things. Don't worry, its totally fucking funny.(No its not, that's blatant sarcasm and if you think this is gonna be funny, it's not.Sorry, but the rubbish bin is not where you look for anything remotely good)
