    Summary
      Things have... escalated, to say the least.no guardian, few friends and a whole lot of pressure.
since that's the case how about a bit of reprieve from the hot mess that is the city of Paris and go to Gotham! a perfectly sound plan...
sure there are villains... but hey! at least now you can be mad about it or scared.
((like when she gets left behind on multiple occasions!))
villains and criminals aren't the only things that Marinette finds in the city of crime, although... is stealing her heart counted as a crime? 
it matters not! she can deal with a crush!
she is trending?... sure she can deal with fame... or at least she will be needing to soon anyway.
she gets a new family?... sure sure, she can deal with more mouths to feed
wait... why are they all so protective?! she has been a good person, she doesn't deserve this!! QAQ.
(Marinette could NOT, in fact, deal with a crush. it all went downhill from there)

      When The Evillustrator's crush on Marinette proves to be more dangerous than either hero expected, Chat's new princess friend proves she's less of a 'Snow White' princess and more of a 'Mulan' kinda girl.

I was bored and stupid now with an aizawa pov!!

    Summary
      If there is one thing that Shouto Todoroki knows, it is that everyone has their secrets. From the greatest hero to the lowest villain, to all that remains between that gap, each person has something they hide from the world.And Izuku Midoriya is no different.-----In which Todoroki believes his conspiracy a little too much, and ends up wanting to protect his friend.
