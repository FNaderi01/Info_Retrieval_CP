    Summary
      Jungkook wasn't always this way. He wasn't so gone that he didn't have awareness of his actions. But he relished in it. The sick and twisted depths of his mind drove his being entirely. He didn't want anything else. He wanted Seokjin.[A work in which college student Jeon Jungkook is a sick bastard who develops a disturbing, unhealthy obsession for Kim Seokjin, one of his older brother's mutual friends. His mere admiration turns to an obsession and avalanches into a series of unfortunate, unpleasant events.]

    Summary
      The Complete Cases Of Sherlock Holmes And John Watson. All 366 cases plus assorted interludes, hiatuses, codas &amp;c. 1899-1900. A short but important period in the careers of the dynamic duo as having averted the end of the world (as you do), Sherlock recovers from his carelessness in hurting his beloved John and encounters questionable bequests, crooked gamblers, helpful saints, unhelpful sailors, prejudiced professors, harassed hairdressers, jumping journalists, turbulent priests, unusual cab-drivers, Spartan behemoths and an attempt to destroy a close friend. Plus there is one of the two most famous previously unpublished cases, the Abernetty Affair or why the parsley sank so low into the butter. And then a kind act of the great detective repays itself with a chance to truly make his beloved a very happy man in the wee small hours of the morning (no, not that way!).

I do not know honestly Lieutenants Duo That's what I kinda call them sometimes lmao Male-Female Friendship Fluff This is fanfiction Enough tags for this Season 2 related spoilers beware If you haven't watched Season 2 of AnKyou (yet) or read the Manga I tried my best remembering the scenes This is not canon (kinda a what-if scene) Probably around close to Season 2 Episode 16 spoilers Takes place in Winter Holidays i tried my best lol One Shot Short One Shot but it hints to the two characters title might not be that accurate gonna have to be honest with that Again I TRIED my very best with this fic Kinda updating this very quickly lmao
    Summary
      The two who would be kinda called the "Lieutenants" of Red and Blue. (One day assumingbly... haha?)Putting that aside...Having heard the whole truth, all of the students feel unsure about it. But they will have to kill him, for the sake of it. It was the winter holidays, christmas coming soon. Even for that, everyone aren't sure about their assassination plans at this point, wether current ones they had or new ones they wanted to do.Sugino Tomohito doesn't know what to feel about this. The truth hit him and his classmates (to say like a truck). No assassination plans in mind... it just wasn't easy.He ended up receiving a call from one of his classmates, Nakamura Rio. Telling him to go with her to somewhere, outside...."Hey, want to talk about it?"

    Summary
      SAD-ist was known at her school for being awfully blunt, or in other terms truthful.She just can't help it! Sometimes her thoughts just slip out of her mouth, then she meets him, who despite not being in the best mood, accepts her for who she is. SAD-ist was sometimes bullied by other students at her school, since some people just can't accept the truth.Dream fights off some very shady men who had more ill intentions rather than 'just' a bully from school towards SAD-ist."Man with a smiling mask axes some thugs to defend a girl with a frowny mask, kinky."-Sapnap 203X

    Summary
      Catra knew she could lean on Adora. Adora was there for her, to protect her from highschool bullies like Lonnie. She shared her lunch when Catra's mom was too drunk to buy groceries. Let her come over for dinner...and late night sleepovers. But that all ended in 10th grade when Adora left the state. Catra pleaded Adora to change her parents' minds. But in the end, her efforts were futile when Adora left a week later.She had to learn to lean on herself. Protect herself.Adora swore to herself she'd return one day and confess the feelings she felt for Catra all along. But her hopes go flaccid when she returns only to find her childhood has moved on...

    Summary
      Kibo is the daughter of the infamous S-ranked villain, Taimuterā. She was trained to rule her father’s criminal organization, and become a villain greater than All For One. But when her mother is murdered, she snaps. Kibo escapes with her little brother, Shizuka, and calls the heroes. She is adopted by her martial arts teacher and best friend Yukiyama Jiko, and now she lives a semi-normal life. But Kibo still struggles with the pain of her past, and barely interacts with anyone outside of her family. When she enters U.A, she brings a fresh set of burdens and secrets that she carries alone, but how long will it be before she snaps?(Shenanigans, fluff and angst will ensue. Also, will update summary soon.)
