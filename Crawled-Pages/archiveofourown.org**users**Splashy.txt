    Summary
      Luz makes a surprised chirping noise in the back of her throat and pauses her scribbling to gently touch the inside of Amity’s elbow. 'Sorry if I startled you,' it says, and then she’s back hurriedly scratching on her own paper, tongue sticking out slightly.It’s the first of their shared gestures that act as a stand in for absent communication, though neither of them note its significance at the time.Amity huffs in amusement and angles her notebook so it’s easier for the other girl to read.---a small collection of shorts about love language, as told from the two who speak it and others who notice it.[this fic is fully finished behind the scenes! i will be uploading one of five chapters every other day, to be completed on the fifteenth of october.]
