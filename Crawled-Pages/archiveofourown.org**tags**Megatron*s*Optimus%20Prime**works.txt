    Summary
      Unrelated drabbles and ficlets created from prompts given to me on Tumblr that don't quite have a home elsewhere.***Trying to make this even more obvious:As I've had it asked before - I don't take fic requests here. These ficlets are fills for prompts given to me by Tumblr users during certain times of the year that I invite people to send me ideas. There is never a guarantee I'll actually write a fill to a prompt, and there is no associated timeline with any potential fills, as I look to these when I'm lacking inspiration. However, if you are interested in a particular fanfiction request you can find more information at my dreamwidth account.

    Summary
      The first time she'd met Megatronus, Orion had to go to Rajni's clinic with her, because she'd tripped over her own feet and broken her wrist, too busy staring at the gladiator throwing her head back to laugh. As Rajni had fixed her up, she'd grumbled out, "Your processor doesn't work very well around her, does it? "Five hundred years later and Ophelia could confidently say that the answer to that was no.

    Summary
      As a skilled interrogator, Starscream threatens the stubbornly resisting Bumblebee with his worst fear. Or so it seems, until Megatron enters the scene.In addition to what any Autobot can expect from his ruthless Decepticon captors, Bumblebee's fears center on the private fantasies that he has been turning into stories. As Bumblebee stays on the Nemesis, his worry-dreams start to come true in dark and threatening ways. He struggles to navigate the thriving culture of stories the Decepticons use for war, propaganda and, of course, interface.What it means to triumph in adversity transforms as Bumblebee sees the war through diverse stories. To endure, to survive, to keep his dignity - and to laugh, to tell better stories, and to make a difference in the world! - he seeks the third way between defeat and defeating others. But Megatron has his own plans for his captive.

    Summary
      This is an AU (sort of) that consists of a devastating attack on Megatron and his team from the Autobot forces on Cybertron.
As fires burn and his leader suffers a wound that would ether kill him or leave him at the Autobot's torture, Soundwave makes a desperate choice.To save his Lord he transfers Megaton's spark into a new frame; a small, gentle femme that used to be known as Stardust...The sacrifice will not only alter Megaton's world but Optimus's as he finds her dying frame after the attack and takes her into his care, never knowing it is the supposedly dead Megatron that resides inside now...Thus a new path of destiny expands.Both leaders will face the realities of the war they fight through this unexpected change, both shall face their weaknesses and perhaps, find their true selves because of it.

    Graphic Depictions Of Violence Major Character DeathMegatron/Orion Pax Megatron/Optimus Prime Bulkhead/Wheeljack Ratchet/Rodimus/Drift Arcee/GreenlightThere's so much that I'm gonna update this one later when I have a coherent list.Pre-War Later there are instances of graphic substance abuse as well as graphic violence murder and gladitorial scenes there are also instances of ableism in the form of the Purity's actions there is graphic war graphic descriptions of flashbacks there is also mentions of diseases and different types of ailments with the introduction of volucite grapes in the cybertronian bodies there is also instances of "pregnancy" and "childbirth" that may occur but it is censored and mentioned in passing and occasionally upfront. there are also references of religion and spirituality as well as existentialism and philosophy and questioning the universe there is also mentions of unreality and apocalypse as well as the end of the world there are instances of child abuse/child neglect and many many more graphic and potentially triggering content. on a lighter note there are tropes such as found family healthy relationships between parents and children moments and breaks of genuine joy and happiness and several other positive things that happen later on! this may be updated when I'm able to add any warnings that I may've forgotten. OH and check it out - Occulus now has its own official fandom wiki. The explicit label is so that readers under 15 are deterred from reading this as I'm not comfortable with people ~15 reading
    Summary
      Cybertron was once a peaceful society, a peaceful world. Everyone fit their roles; and everything flowed and lived like clockwork under a powerful Mother and her assisting court. This is the story of one particular boy and his path of growth and learning alongside friends and companions. This is the story of Cybertron's downward-spiral into war, into carnage and into hell, and afterwards a cult and ancient prophecies of destruction.EDIT: THIS IS NOT INTENDED FOR YOUNG AUDIENCES. IF YOU ARE UNDER 15, PLEASE FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO READ

    Summary
      He turned back to the window he had been facing, staring into the pitch-black night and tried to compose himself while on the inside he was breaking apart.    This has to be, it was the only logical choice. For Praxus. *In the midst of the Autobot/Decepticon war, a single mech has to make a decision that he might just regret in the future.

    Summary
      Optimus fell in love with Megatron before the idea of an arranged marriage was raised. He never expected this relationship to be easy, but now it just seems so straight forward. For Shockwave, Falling in love while undercover as Longarm, it was never going to be anything close to simple.

    Summary
      There's a lot of rules to wear a crown, don't slouch, speak clearly, hold your helm up high, don't offend any of your allies, don't become romantically attached to anyone who serves you.That last one is a bit harder then you think.
