                                                4 charged after demo against UK far-right festival

                Police say they have charged four protesters after a demonstration against a festival held by the far-right British National Party.
Hundreds of protesters marched Saturday near the annual Red, White and Blue festival in Codnor, central England.
Police said the protest was largely peaceful, but some demonstrators tried to break through a cordon and threw objects at officers.
Derbyshire Constabulary said Sunday that three people had been charged with public order offenses and one with unlawfully obstructing the highway.
In all 19 people were detained. The rest were fined, warned or released.
The BNP opposes immigration and does not accept nonwhite members. It has been emboldened after winning two seats in June elections for the European Parliament.
