            New Beginnings (M)        pairing: werewolf!jeongguk x readergenre: Slight angst, fluff (?), smut (jeongguk has a breeding kink, Alpha kink kinda, passionate jeongguk), kinda enemies to friends to lovers? lol words: 17.4k (i’m sorry)warnings: blood mention, non present character death ———–It was cold. Fresh snow covered the soft forest ground in a sheet of pure white, some delicately resting on the branches of the bare trees that lived around you as more continued to fall from the sky above. The iciness burned your bare hands, leaving them red, flushed and numb as your excited giggles rang throughout the empty forest like a mantra. You were only four years old, and every year since your birth you would visit your grandfather at his cabin in the woods. Your mother, his only daughter, had passed during childbirth and afterwards he had secluded himself to a simple cabin in the woods that was miles away from any form of civilization to continue his independent research studies. He was a retired wildlife biologist, his motivation to continue his work in a professional setting dying along with his only child.  Keep reading

            Will You Make a Mess Now?        Originally posted by myloveseokjinJungkook’s never been touched before and, after a hectic end to his semester, he thinks he wants that to change…Pairing: Jungkook x ReaderGenre: Virgin! Jungkook, established relationship au, college au, smut, fluff.Word Count: 4.7kA/N: HELLO YES I MISSED YOU. Guys, I swear i’m working on updating my series (plural) but, I’ve been out of writing for a while and, I needed something to get me back in the groove. What better way than to continue to affirm that my love for Jungkook is unavoidable and, unstoppable. i love youuuuu. This is unedited for now, please forgive any mistakes, I was too excited. Warnings: smut, language, 18+ only please.After 4 grueling months of relentless studying and lectures,
you can finally say that your second to last semester of university is finally
over.Finals week is still at the entrance of your subconscious as
its literally all you’ve been able to think about for quite some time. You
haven’t been able to unwind or see your friends and, if you’re being honest,
you don’t remember the last time you actually slept for more than four hours at
a time. The good news is…All of that is now behind you. The exams have been taken, the textbooks have been returned
or re-sold, the mountain of instant meals have been cleared from your kitchen
(for now) and, you are currently on the subway headed to celebrate with the
only person in the world that could properly bring you out of your post-exam
haze: Your boyfriend, Jungkook. Keep reading

            Long Time No See [Jungkook x Reader]        Long Time No See [Jungkook x Reader]Credits: @kimtaehyunq​Genre: Smut | 21+ | WerewolfAU | One Shot | First-PersonWarnings: werewolf!jungkook, language, adult content, marking, angst, foreplay, oral (M),
strong/mature theme, mentions of death, sensitive contents/triggers, unprotected sex, split moment of a half-creampie, jeon’s
hostile but still soft, exbestfriends to lovers, etc. don’t read if you don’t like dominant behavior. WC: 8.6k+Summary: Jungkook, my werewolf best friend, leaves
town without warning or notice after a series of brutal killings. Days, weeks,
months go by without any contact or sign of him – causing me to fear the worse.
Until one late chilly night, after an exhausting and stressful time, a knock at
my apartment door wakes me up. And now I have a Jungkook sitting on my couch,
filled with animosity. Teaser: “You have no idea how fantastic this
feels, Y/n.” A more audible growl rumble caved through his sternum. My touch,
my smell, everything about me was setting Jungkook ablaze. Euphoric
exhilarations trickled all over his skin, smothering him with the upmost
lustful paradise he’s ever experienced.”Author’s note: I’m slowly learning more and more
about different universes. Figuring out what I like and don’t like, what I want
to write about and what I don’t. Not sure how I exactly feel about my stories,
but hopefully you at least enjoy the read! (Please tell me if there are any mistakes) Thank you! 💗

Love youWarnings: smut, language, 18+ only please.Winter break never lasts long enough does it?A few short weeks of bliss and then-BOOM.You’re forced out of the warm and lazy cocoon of holiday
spirit and, back into the rigidity of modern education.It’s not that you don’t enjoy your studies, it’s just
that after nearly four years of exams and, group projects that never go exactly
as planned; you are starting to feel burnt out.It also doesn’t help that you spent the majority of your
winter break sleeping over at your boyfriends house.You got used to the weight of his head on your chest.You got used to running your fingers through his hair; an
act that lulled both of you to sleep.You got used to waking up beside him every morning.When the semester started once again, the two of you
agreed that you’d reserve overnight stays to weekends only.As encouraging as you were of each other’s success,
copious amounts of alone time is a (delightful) distraction.Especially since the two of you began exploring the
boundaries of your relationship.At the beginning of winter break, Jungkook had revealed
to you that not only was he a virgin but, he’s never been touched before. Keep reading

            Star Light, Star Bright        ; Single Dad!Jimin x Tattoo Artist!Reader; Genre: Fluff, smut, a tiny bit of angst; Word Count: 17.5k; Warnings: Oral sex (female receiving), penetrative sex, light biting; Synopsis: Life has not gone exactly how Park Jimin imagined, and yet he can’t possibly imagine his life any different to what it is now. After six hard and stressful years, he’s now the happy owner of a degree along with being the proud dad of his little girl. But what happens when he meets you and his life is tipped upside down once more?-In Park Jimin’s 24 years of existence, he’d already had three life altering moments. The first, had been the day when his high school girlfriend had told him she was pregnant when they were only 17. He remembers the ice that had flooded his veins as the words fell from her lips along with the fear of his parents retribution.The second, had been the day his daughter had been born and he’d held her in his arms for the first time. He remembers the sheer, overwhelming love he’d felt upon the sight of his tiny baby as she’d squirmed slightly with her face scrunched up and how he’d sworn to himself then and there that he’d do anything for her.The third had been when he was eighteen, and the day his high school girlfriend had informed him that she was leaving them both because she didn’t want her life to stop for a baby. He’d felt numb with shock before confusion and anger had moved in like a creeping fog.It had only been when he’d been cradling Eun-Byeol at 2am in the morning that he’d realised what he’d have to give up. He’d been applying to the local colleges for when he graduated high school, intending to stay at home to help with the baby.His shock had been so great that he hadn’t even told his parents about Sunmi leaving him, and he’d collapsed into a fit of panic at the sudden enormity of what was ahead of him. A road that was filled with trouble and pain, covered in a smog of the unknown that he couldn’t see through. Keep reading

            2! 3! (M)        The one at the end of Jungkook’s Wembley Vlive.Pairing: Jungkook x readerWarnings: Absolutely tooth-rottingly sweet fluff and smut.  Vanilla sex, unprotected. Word count: 3K“Hana, dul, set!”  And just like that, with a most tired and satisfied sigh, Jungkook ends the recording and slouches back into his chair.  His head flops back, eyes falling closed, and you can’t help but smile at how pretty he looks even when his face is dangling upside down.  “You did really good, boo.”  The sound of your voice has him sitting straight again in an instant - likely having forgotten you were even in the room - but when he turns in his seat to face you with that boyish grin he wears so well, you swear your stomach somersaults in reply, far too in love to ever think to hold his preoccupation against him.   “Yeah?” he asks as he rises.  Crossing the small space to the edge of the bed, he mounts it on his hands and knees.  “Yeah,” you grin, “Your English is getting better all the time.” Your compliment has Jungkook smiling as he crawls to you; happiness still tugging at the lips he leans forward and presses to yours in a kiss that ends far too soon.  He sinks back from his knees to sit at your side, tilting his head to rest on yours and making you hum with contentment when he turns it to press another kiss amongst your hair, soft and sweet.  Rotating your body to face him you lean in too, thankful to finally have him all to yourself - if only for a little while.  You’d barely stepped foot into the hotel room before Jungkook was setting up his desk space for an impromptu Vlive, still buzzing from all the residual energy from tonight’s concert.  He’d been so insistent in his need to talk to ARMY - his one and only focus throughout the entire journey home - but you can understand why he’d felt that way.  Having seen it first hand, tonight’s rendition of Young Forever had moved you just as much as it had Jungkook; tears running down your face even as you watched the closing fireworks fly.   Keep reading

bedroom.He kisses you like you’re the only person in the world.Like you’re the only person in the universe…Sex often happens organically but, there are times when the

            A Court Of Curses        ; Vampire Prince!Hoseok x Witch Queen!Reader; Genre: Smut, angst, fluff; Warnings: Fingering, oral sex (receiving), choking kink, unprotected sex, biting (vampiric), blood play, creampie, dom!Hoseok, sub!reader, dirty talk, mentions and talk of miscarriage; Word Count: 29.3k; Synopsis: For millennia, the vampires and witches have hated one another and war has raged between the two. When tensions flare up once more and spill into neutral land, peace is forced upon the two by the faeries. The price of peace sees the Witch Queen married to the Vampire Prince. One hundred years later, how have things changed?; A/N: So… I hope people like this. I know it’s super long but I’m hoping people will enjoy. Please let me know what you all think to our delightful vampire prince and please, if you enjoy then reblog and comment! It will help this story reach more people given the issues Tumblr is having!-The relations between vampires and witches have always been tense and strenuous. For thousands of years, your people and the vampires have fought in anger and other negative emotions with diplomacy almost non-existent. Retaliation after retaliation, until the original cause of the rift between both races has long been forgotten by the general population.But you knew how it all began. Your father, the Witch King, had made sure the history of both races was taught to you as you’d grown up within the walls of the seat of power in Hekatalia. That included learning the horrifying knowledge that would fracture your society if they remembered, and would likely incite refusals to acknowledge what had happened. For your people were not the victims, no matter how much they tried to plead it after various vampire attacks.Amongst your kind, there were various forms of magic that witches performed. Most remained firmly in the white category, with their magic innocent and pure. Some gravitated towards grey, with hexes being cast in anger or annoyance but never crossing an unseen line.Dark witches though, revelled in the more sinister aspect of magic. Shunned by the normal population, dark magic was performed with especially negative emotions that thirsted for power, driven solely by desire. Sacrifice was common, and torture had been heard of. While deemed repellant by witch society at large, the wicked magic performed by dark witches was often considered required, for you could not have light without dark. Keep reading

            Moon Breaker        Pairing: BTS Taehyung  ⇆ ReaderGenre: Werewolf | Fluff | Angst | Smut |Summary: Tales as old as time were passed through the werekind. If a human and a kind were to be mates, the moon would take them, the misfortune, to serve the Goddess. Taehyung, a kind, had always heard of the tales told by his elders. The alpha of his kind.

Thank you for the permission to use the image.| Masterlist |Holding her in his arms he wept until a sea of his tears
pooled around them. The soil was tainted in sorrow. He watched as her eyes from
the outside in, like white frost covering the window, slowly turned opal. She
reached up, mouth agape as she gasped for air. She cupped his cheek catching
his tears as they rolled over her knuckles. The opal bleeds and engulfed her
black pupils and with her last strangled breath, her back arched. His breath
came in ragged, and shallow before he was wailing out, sobbing as he brought
her chest to his forehead. He couldn’t hear it, her heart was silent. It was icy cold as her spirit lifted from her body, white
and translucent. She lifted until she hovered above the soil to a stand. “My
love,” her disembodied voice spoke to him as he wept into her being. Lifting
his head he saw her spirit smile down at him. The glimpse of brown that once
was her eyes was completely white. She caressed his cheek gently one last time,
“I will always love you.”It was his mistake, he swore to never look, he swore to the
goddess he would never look.She stepped into the moonlight and her light absorbed into
the moonlight. She was gone. His mate was gone. Keep reading

Pairings:  Namjoon x Reader, Mention of Seokjin x Reader Summary: Kim Namjoon, famous author and your childhood friend has been keeping a secret from you. His new book treads on such dark themes that he’s finding it difficult to write. Excited by the prospect of a sinister plot you offer him a piece of advice, “Let the villain win…” …You look to the building pile of manuscripts on your desk, curling your lip over the prospect of reading them. You’re sure that some of them will be good, a couple of them might hold your attention, but none of them are the story that you truly want to read, the one that you are waiting for, the one that was due three days ago…“I’m going to kill him.” You mutter to yourself while taking a sip of tea. Kim Namjoon, one of the finest thriller authors ever to be published, and your best friend since childhood. You have the privilege to represent him as his literary agent, but that comes with its setbacks. Namjoon never seems to take you seriously when you set a deadline. Even now he’s off gallivanting somewhere, refusing to answer his calls or texts until he returns from his ‘creative space’.  Keep reading

            Seven Seas        ; Atlantis Taehyung x Reader; Genre: Fluff, angst, smut; Word Count: 25.5k; Warnings: Unprotected sex, oral sex (receiving); Synopsis: Atlantis is a myth; a hidden city, a sunken island, a missing continent. Only…it’s not a myth. Just hidden out of choice. As the daughter of an Atlantean and a human, you are a halfling that is unwanted by the underwater continent and misunderstood by the surface. But what happens when you finally go to Atlantis and meet an Atlantean who is oddly kind to you?; A/N: I swear this fic almost broke me like 3 days. I really hope you like it and that it’s not bad. Please make sure to like and reblog, and leave me comments or asks so I can see what you think! I’d really love the feedback!Also, her speech is supposed to sound more stilted when she’s speaking Atlantean to reflect that she’s not fluent in it!-Throughout history there have been stories of hidden cities, islands and continents that have been told by many civilisations across the world. From Camelot to El Dorado, Shambhala to Zerzura, these mythical cities have captured the imaginations of millions of humans. All fascinated with the idea that there is something still to be discovered on Earth.But when someone mentions the idea of a ‘hidden’ or ‘lost’ city, it is undoubtedly Atlantis that springs to mind for many people. Some believe it to still be hidden somewhere, whereas others believe it to have sunk millennia ago. Others believe it is a myth entirely.Atlantis is very much a real place however, it is just that humanity thought too small. For it is not a city, nor is it an island. It is a kingdom and a continent that stretches the entire length of the Atlantic Ocean; from the North Pole to Antarctica. If Atlantis were above the surface, it would comfortably be the largest continent on the planet.The people of Atlantis were not like humans either, even though they walked and talked like them. To a human, they would be almost indistinguishable. It has undoubtedly helped them to hide throughout the centuries, though not well enough to prevent any rumours of a hidden city.You know that well, given that your own father is an Atlantean and your mother is a human. She had grown up in the little seaside town you called home, with a fisherman for a father. The sea had been in her blood, but not nearly as much as it was in the blood of the handsome man who had shown up on her shore on her 23rd birthday.Claiming to be a traveller from a foreign land who wanted to experience life in the sleepy town of Sunset Cove, he paid your mother to stay in the spare room of her tiny cottage. After a few months of boarding with her, he slowly opened up and told her wild stories of an advanced civilisation living under the waves of the very sea she loved so dearly.The stories slowly brought them together until their mutual attraction could no longer be denied. A whole year after he had appeared on her shore, she had fallen pregnant and eight months later they had welcomed a tiny, healthy girl into the world; you. Keep reading

happiest he’s ever been.The days seemed to drift by carelessly, delicately…He feels completely at ease in the small but luxurious apartment
that the two of you share. Jungkook is a sensitive soul. He’s strong but,
encased in a warm glow of tenderness. Since being on break, he’s only further
retreated into himself but, in the best way possible. He’s been playing video
games, messing about with a new digital art program on his laptop, taking
photographs of the view off of your high rise balcony. He’s been singing but
only when he’s in the shower, he’s gained a few pounds, stuffing his face
whenever he gets the chance but, you’re happy to feed him. You’re happy to see
how soft and happy your boyfriend has become. For the first time, you see the
furrow between his brows smooth out; he isn’t anxious, he feels no pressure, he
feels only happiness.“Jagiya…where is this…from…?” He struggles a bit over his
enormous bite of jasmine rice, “Where is it?” Keep reading

under the sea || pjm (m)Originally posted by ohrayannadarling-deactivated201╰ A one shot inspired by the fairytale “The Little Mermaid” by Hans Christian Andersen.「part of my “Twisted Tales” series 」 ♆ pairing: merman!jimin x female reader♆ word count: 16k♆ genre: fluff, humor, smut, slight angst♆ warnings: oral (f&amp;m), fingering, unprotected sex, one almost-drowning, and mentions of death. but mostly just a lot of tooth-rottingly sweet jimin fluff lol ♆ a/n: part one of twisted tales is finally here!! this one is a long one but i hope you enjoy cute merman jimin in my take on the little mermaid!!——————————————————You stood on the shore and took a deep breath, your senses instantly flooding with the sharp yet familiar salty breeze that rolled off the sea. The clouds overhead were grey and foreboding, and choppy, white-capped waves crashed violently onto the shore as you towed your small rowboat across the damp sand to the edge of the water.Today’s weather was in no way ideal for sailing, and you knew that; years of experience living by the seaside in your humble little cabin and fishing to earn your living, had taught you well. But you also knew that if you didn’t get out there and make a catch today, you’d have nothing to sell at the market tomorrow, and that meant no money to pay for food and other necessities, so forging ahead into the stormy seas you went.You slid the bow of your boat into the dark waters, pushing from behind until it was fully afloat in the shallows and climbing inside. Beginning to row away from the shore, you fought sharply against the unrelenting battering of the harsh seas, but regardless of the opposition you faced, you simply steadied your grip on your oars and pressed forward with determination.You couldn’t help but let your mind wander, reminiscing, as you often did these days, on how you used to navigate these same waters with your father not all that long ago. Your mother having passed when you were born, your father had raised you entirely on his own. He was a clever and resourceful man, funny, and endlessly kind—as well as a skilled fisherman himself. He taught you everything you knew, not only about living off the seas, but about life, and you treasured each parcel of wisdom he’d gifted to you; especially now that he was no longer with you.It had been a few years since he’d passed away, but still you thought of him every day; thought of what he would say if he were here, or how he would tackle whatever problem you were facing. “Water off a duck’s back, Y/N.” He’d repeat his silly old mantra to you again and again in times of fear or doubt. Your father had been your very best—and practically only—friend for your whole life, and without him, you felt undeniably lost and alone. And so you had resolved to just take things one day at a time, and continue living the way you had been for years, all the while the need for something more in your life, for someone more in your life, lay dormant in your heart.When you had traveled out a considerable distance into the bay, you decided it was time to try and cast your net. You waited for a moment of calm in the waves before standing up and reaching for the well-worn ropes you had knotted together by hand, unfurling them over the side of the boat and casting them into the sea. However, it seemed you had been deceived by the brief lull in the tides, as the moment your net settled into the water, a massive rogue wave rose up behind you and slammed into your ill-equipped seacraft with unforgiving force before you even had time to react. Your small vessel rocked violently with the impact, sending you tumbling over the side and into the drink below.The sea was cold and black, and from the moment you hit the water, you were chilled right down to the bone. Fighting against the punishing current, you kicked and flailed desperately, trying to make your way back up to the surface to catch a breath, but your efforts proved fruitless. Your clothes felt heavy, completely soaked now, and they had begun to weigh you down, making any attempt of reaching the air above almost impossible. The oxygen in your lungs was quickly dissipating, and your body was tiring quickly of your frantic movements. Perhaps drowning was a peaceful death? You had begun to bargain with yourself. At first, your lungs had screamed and burned with the sudden influx of water, but after a few moments you felt no pain at all, and you no longer wanted to fight against the numbness that was taking over your body. Slowly, you felt yourself sinking lower and lower into the deep, your consciousness slipping away as the last bubbles of breath escaped from your lips.You were so beyond your surroundings, that you barely registered the feeling of strong arms wrapping around you, as someone gathered you into their chest and pulled you from the water. Your back hit something solid and damp; the sand? You felt a stinging in your chest, an intense pressure, and you fought to regain consciousness as a voice drifted into your field of perception.“Come on, open your eyes,” the voice pleaded, desperately with you. “Oh god, please open your eyes.” It was a man’s voice; soft and melodic, but laced with anguish and muddled by your mind in it’s suspended state of functioning. Slowly, your heavy eyelids began to lift, and as you regained your blurry vision, you could just make out the image of someone above you. With his beautifully indiscernible features and ethereal aura, his visage backlit by the rays of sunlight that poked out from between the dark clouds, he looked like an angel, and for a moment you wondered if you were dead. “That’s it,” he encouraged you, hopefully, his tone picking up considerably at the signs of life you exhibited. His words assured you that you were, in fact, still alive, and beckoned you to return to the world of the living like a siren’s song. “Come back to me.” Keep reading

            Forever Or Never        Originally posted by yoonseok; Hoseok x Reader; Genre: Fluff, angst, smut; Word Count: 15k; Warnings: Penetrative sex, oral sex (female receiving), fingering; Synopsis: What do you do when your best friend of 23 years tells you that they’ve been in love with you for the last decade? Hoseok sure as hell doesn’t know. But he’s trying, he’s trying really hard for you. But will you get the fairytale ending you dream of? Or will you have to settle for cold hard reality?; A/N: This is the sequel to Ten Years! It’s in my masterlist so please check it out! Also, Hoseok is such an awkward bean in this. He’s adorable really.-To say that Hoseok had spent the last month and a half since your confession to him confused would be a complete understatement. In fact, he’d been severely struggling with it and it made him feel terrible. He wanted desperately to maintain things as they were to keep things consistent for you, and yet how could he when he knew that you looked at him with such intense emotions?But he tried still, and he tried his hardest to make things easier for you.He gave you space, even though you’d begged him not to. But he knew that you’d need it to come to terms with the fact that you’d confessed to him and not had the happy reunion that you’d likely fantasised about.It was also space that Hoseok needed as well, to try and detach away from you a little to assess himself and his own feelings. Because he’d never thought of you that way before. Sure, he’d had fantasies when he was a teenager and had entertained the idea of dating or sex but never since.He’d just…you were his best friend. You’d never shown interest in his eyes and he’d done the same to you.Only now he felt like an idiot, because he was wrong. He was so…so wrong.You had been showing interest in him, he’d just been too blind to see it. Too content with how your relationship was to see what could have been. And so now he was having to think hard on everything. Did he want to date you? Did he like you as only a friend? Or could he see himself falling in love with you?Could he date you? Would be a good boyfriend to you? What if he broke your heart? What if it all went wrong?So many questions, so many worries and so little answers to be found. It was frightening to him, because he was truly terrified of hurting you more. It made him feel a little sick to think that he’d failed so abysmally in his job as a best friend. He was supposed to support you and comfort you through the pain of heartbreak.Not be the reason for it. Keep reading
