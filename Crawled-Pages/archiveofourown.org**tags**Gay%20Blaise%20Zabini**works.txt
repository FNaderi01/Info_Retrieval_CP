    Summary
      Still being hung-up on your ex two years after she dumped you is totally normal and not an obsession... right?According to Pansy's friends, she's "obsessive" and "needs help", but what do they know? Pansy knows she's perfectly fine. Sure, she keeps Hermione's schedule on hand and follows her to lunch sometimes. But that doesn't mean anything!So why are her friends so convinced she needs therapy?

    Summary
      Hermione wants to achieve big things. She doesn't have time to dedicate to a partner and have a family. Sure, she wants babies some day, and she has a supportive extended family, and she is only on the up and up in her profession so could happily provide, partnered or not. She can't possibly have it all? Can she? Meanwhile somewhere in California a certain Nadya Suleman is making headlines after being implanted with eight embryos.

    Summary
      The hottest romances are the most compatible. We present Blaise Zabini/Gellert Grindelwald. How you ask? Elementary! What if it wasn't Gellert Grindelwald killed by Voldemort in 1997? What would he do with his life with youth restored and love to live for? It contradicts nothing from the books so even remains canon, just giving a glance at parts of the wizarding community unseen by Harry Potter's perspective. This begins just before Harry and co's final year at Hogwarts.
