In mathematics, "symmetry" has a more precise definition, and is usually used to refer to an object that is invariant under some transformations; including translation, reflection, rotation or scaling. Although these two meanings of "symmetry" can sometimes be told apart, they are intricately related, and hence are discussed together in this article.Mathematical symmetry may be observed with respect to the passage of time; as a spatial relationship; through geometric transformations; through other kinds of functional transformations; and as an aspect of abstract objects, including theoretic models, language, and music.The opposite of symmetry is asymmetry, which refers to the absence or a violation of symmetry.Show lessRead moreWikipedia21,802 itemsOrganize byTopicsSymmetryMore mediumsTextile70,271 itemsPhotograph86,610 itemsMetal131,072 itemsSilk35,083 itemsRock81,883 itemsWatercolor painting46,064 itemsTranslate with GoogleAccountSearchMapsYouTubePlayNewsGmailMeetContactsDriveCalendarTranslatePhotosDuoChromeShoppingFinanceDocsSheetsSlidesBooksBloggerHangoutsKeepJamboardEarthCollectionsArts and CultureGoogle AdsPodcastsMore from GoogleGoogle apps
