    Summary
      For years, the monsters have been trying to find a way to escape the Underground. Every single day is spent waiting for a human to arrive. Some have grown impatient, while others have the lingering doubt that a human will ever come. But to reassure the young children in Snowdin that they will get the chance to see the sun, Papyrus ends up taking the Sentry duty—and while he’s not so sure if freedom will ever come, he’s willing to play along if it makes his family happy.But what happens when a small child falls down? What happens when they flee the ruins and end up in Snowdin? What happens when the child meets Papyrus, and upon seeing how scared and weak they are, he can’t bring himself to turn them in? What if instead, he takes it upon himself to take care of them?
