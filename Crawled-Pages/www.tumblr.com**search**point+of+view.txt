            Deciding on a POV        There are many ways to tell a story, and each one comes with a benefit or a downside. Still, I figured it’s worth going over the different ways each can be effective.First PersonReliable Narrator: A story with a reliable First Person narrator is one of the most common narrative styles. What this means is that the reader can trust what the narrator is telling them is the truth as it actually happened. Think Percy Jackson in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians Series.The reliable narrator is far more common than the unreliable variety. The benefit of this narrative style is that it mirrors how we tell stories verbally. If something happened to me, and I tell my friend what happened, I am going to use First Person narration to explain the events that transpired. Thus, this can feel like the most organic option. It also allows for total access to the POV character’s thoughts, allowing readers to see how they reached a conclusion, or why they’re acting a certain way. However, this can come with the problem of not being able to get inside the head of anyone except for the narrator. Now, while it’s standard for the First Person narrator to be the main character, it isn’t always the case. If the narrator is some sort of omniscient, bystander, or divine presence, whether they interact with the characters or not, it technically falls under First Person if they voice their opinion using I statements. The figure of Death in The Book Thief is a good example of this, as Death uses I and me in the narrative of the story. Because the story is set in Germany during World War II, the narrator of Death sees the protagonist, Liesel, frequently, and thus we’re able to get a narrator who is observing a protagonist from outside of her immediate story.Unreliable Narrator: An Unreliable narrator is going to be the exact opposite. They tell the story, but take their story with a grain of salt. Whether their perception of reality is distorted, they’re using metaphors and symbolic imagery to tell the story, or they’re telling the story from a very narrow viewpoint, the unreliable narrator can be a good choice to get the reader to engage with the story and think critically about the work. Rugrats is a good example of this type of storytelling, as the main characters are babies, and therefore often mistake things for something else, making them unreliable narrators. This type works well if you want to tell a more abstract story. For instance, an entire story is about a boy chasing after a red balloon, but that red balloon itself represents accepting his mother’s death. Suddenly everything experienced becomes unreliable, leaving the reader wondering if the foes he defeated or the desert he crossed was literal, and he went on an actual journey to come to terms with his mother’s death, or was everything figurative, and the journey was more symbolic and allegorical? An unreliable narrator can play with these questions, blur the lines between reality and fiction, and leave their readers asking questions.Third PersonOmniscient: Lemony Snicket is a perfect example of a great omniscient narrator. Mr. Snicket knows everything about every character, knows what’s going to happen before it happens, and comments on everything. Lemony Snicket himself is not a character in the story. Rather he recounts the story much like the First Person style, but from an outside perspective. Instead of being part of the story, Lemony Snicket is telling us about the Baudelaire children through the lens of the all-knowing and opinionated narrator. It’s not entirely uncommon for this type of narrator to be some supernatural force, a wise old sage, or someone who lived through an experience recounting the tale many years later. In fact it could be rather fun to play with this last one, having the story almost be told like a myth or legend, but having the narrator constantly side track to discuss how historians know and gathered the information for this story, only to reveal the narrator isn’t some omniscient being, but just a docent in a museum giving a tour and explaining an old myth to the patrons.Limited: With a Limited POV, the reader learns things as the narrator does. Even though the narrator is the one telling the story, their information is only up to date with whatever is currently happening on the page. This and First Person are the two POV types most likely to appear in a mystery novel, or any novel where a mystery or unanswered questions drives the plot. Harry Potter is a series written in Limited Third Person. The story follows Harry, and the reader only learns information as Harry does. And every year, Harry is faced with the recurring mystery element of figuring out what’s going on, and stopping whatever their plan was. However, because the narrator only knows what the protagonist knows, this can allow you to play around with giving the narrator a personality, and having them comment or react to things as they happen, perhaps even mirroring the way you hope the readers are responding.Objective: Think of Objective Point of View as watching a tv show. Anyone who’s into shipping has to read into objective romantic coding. Two characters held eye contact for five seconds? You the reader have to interpret that as you will. Objective is strangely both the most human and the most robotic point of view. At its most human, Objective treats the narration like a normal person. They can’t read the thoughts of other characters, they don’t know more than the hero or reader, and you’re effectively just a bystander in the crowd watching things happen with no context clues about what’s happening inside a character’s head. On the opposite end, it can also be the most robotic because it is the most lacking in human connection, as it leaves the reader detached from the characters themselves. However, a liberating or perhaps crippling aspect of this POV style is that it frees the author of show don’t tell because this type of POV can’t enter anyone’s minds or go on a rant about a character’s feelings about someone else. You just have to take what you get at face value and all information has to be conveyed through your characters and story, whether directly through dialogue, or subtly through background details.Switching POVsMost stories tend to stick with a single narrator. Stories can be complicated when one person is giving an opinion, but when multiple people are talking, it can be hard to find a voice and plot for each of them. And if you’re planning on writing a series, you may run into the problem of some characters having meatier plots than others. It’s for this reason that when it comes to watching Game of Thrones, I always groan internally whenver the story cuts back to Bran or Jon at the Wall. It’s a scene or two of people standing around being cold or talking about being cold and something something three-eyed raven and then we finally get back to the part I’m more interested in: the political games of manipulation and intrigue. But that’s also a strength of changing POVs. With something like Game of Thrones, you might not necessarily like every storyline happening, but you’re more likely to enjoy one. In a sense, Game of Thrones is like 11 novels stitched together, and because each is so different, you’re more likely to find something in the series that speaks to you. Conversely, when there’s multiple POVs experiencing the same thing, such as with the Heroes of Olympus series, having shifting POVs can be a good way of exploring each character. In The Lost Hero, Piper knows more about the giant waiting to fight them than either Jason or Leo, and because we have shifting POVs, we the reader get access to this otherwise Limited Third Person information from the character who already knows it, thus building dramatic tension of when the others will find out. Another benefit to this is giving unique encounters to the characters. Percy has already met Aphrodite in the past, but through Piper, Aphrodite’s daughter, we’re able to see a different side of this goddess, the goddess as a mother to someone else. This could also manifest in differing opinions of the same things. This is also part of why it works so well in Game of Thrones. Game of Thrones is a civil war story with multiple sides all vying for the same end goal. Because there are so many sides and players in the game, having so many different points of view is valueable to the story being told. If Eddard Stark was the sole protagonist, the only thing that we would know is whatever he knows. Everything Danny is doing across the narrow sea would need to be told to Ned for it to matter. And the same with Jon at the Wall. And if Jon or Danny was the sole narrator, the reader would miss out on everything happening in King’s Landing because neither Danny nor Jon are connected to that part of the plot. An entire element to the story is lost when a major POV character is dropped, which goes to show how strong George RR Martin’s writing really is. Something I like doing with multiple POVs is describing the same character in two different ways from two characters who would see them in a drastically different way. One description might paint a character as dark, alluring, and attractive, while another person might describe them as a rat-faced shifty-eyed snake that stinks of booze and dead fish. It’s the same character, but two different people see that character in entirely different ways. However, this also comes with a major backlash. It can be an absolute nightmare juggling not only so many plots, but trying to make them fit together nicely. You’ll notice this a lot with shows that emphasize drama and interconnecting storylines. They’ll be really strong in their earlier seasons, then peter out once they’ve hit the creative brick wall. It happened to Once Upon a Time and to a lesser extent, Glee. Both shows had tightly knit and compelling drama in season 1, but by season 4, both shows felt like they were just going through the motions and had lost the edge that made them interesting. Even with something as well-written as Game of Thrones, it’s still possible to have someone’s story be weaker than everyone else’s. Arya Stark for instance spent the first couple of seasons focused on learning to sword fighting, then once the Hound died, she went to Braavos, but it always kind of felt more like a detour than really what Arya’s story was supposed to be about. She was a little girl out for vengeance, she went to Braavos for a season or two, didn’t really learn much, and then she came back to Westeros and pretty much went right back to exactly who she was before going to Braavos. Now granted, I’m going by the TV show, but it always felt to me at least that Arya’s vacation in Braavos was just kind of George not knowing what to do with her as he built up to the big climactic battle. So if you’re going to use shifting POVs, it’s important to weigh the pros and the cons carefully.

You can tell the parents are abusive if you always have to see yourself thru their eyes, and they never have to see themselves thru yours. Abusive parents insist on telling you what you’re allowed to think of them, of yourself, of every single action they do. You end up having to consider your every thought and action thru their point of view, or you get brutally reminded that you should have done so, and you are in fact, heartless and cruel and selfish and ignorant of your poor parents if you stop considering their point of view for a second.Even if your parent’s actions are hurtful, cruel and damaging to your well being, you’re not allowed to think about it that way, you get a surge of guilt and anxiety even considering that your parents are cruel and vicious, you are not allowed to even think it. You have to think about why they did it, how they felt, who else could possibly be blamed (mostly you) for their actions, and what if they are in fact, so oblivious they don’t recognize right from wrong? You have to forgive them before they even ask for forgiveness. You aren’t allowed to hold them accountable for anything they do.After a while, thinking about yourself at all starts feeling selfish, the phrase “what about me?” withers from your reality. You become aware that you don’t matter, your opinions don’t count, and you are not allowed to judge anyone, no matter how badly they hurt you. You learn to watch yourself only thru lenses of hatred, because that’s what you’ve been taught to do, you no longer see yourself worthy of anything but hatred. You learn to accept that you’re not considered human. Only your parents are, only the people who hurt you are.It takes a lot to afterwards realize that you’re a person, and very much in right of judging your parents. You have the right to your point of view even when nobody thinks you do. You are a person even if anyone acts like you’re not. It’s on their soul that they’re stepping over a human being with a full beating heart and emotions that will be crushed, only to get what they want. Nobody gets to define what they did to you, or decide if they’re cruel and vicious or not, after doing gross things to you. The truth of what they did cannot be changed by their lies.

You see, you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view…Until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.

anonymous asked:hey, first off I wanted to say I love your blog! but I was also wondering if I could ask a question? please correct me if I’m wrong, but I think you mentioned when replying to an ask that you enjoyed writing in 1st person, and since I’m currently revising my current wip to be in a different pov than it was originally I was wondering if you had any tips on how to write in 1st person? more specifically, how to describe things in 1st person and not make it feel impersonal? thank you so much!!How to Write First PersonOkay, so first person is a personal favorite of mine because it gets you up close and personal with a character. It’s a perfect opportunity to impose an unreliable narrator and it helps the readers connect with the main character more.In order to write a good first person narrative, incorporate their personal emotions a LOT into their storytelling. With first person, this character is directly telling the reader of their own experiences, so they’re going to put their own spin on it. What do you do when you tell a story? Do you blow things up to make things seem more interesting? Do you insert your own personal opinions that may not be relevant to the story?Here’s a snippet of some of my own writing in first person:-“We were in
some sleazy motel room—an absolutely disgusting place, really—that we’d stopped
in while tracking a nest of rogue demons that were responsible for countless
murders. The woman at the register had given us a room with two twin beds out
of habit, and neither of us had wanted to say anything about it, so we just
thanked her and went to our room.            It reminded me of Virgil’s Hotel in
the City of Dis: cracked and peeling floral wallpaper, crusty carpets, itchy
sheets, and old people smell beyond anything that you could even imagine. The
curtains were hideous, and the artwork on the walls looked like it’d been
painted by a toddler and fished out of a dumpster.”-In this excerpt, I put a lot of the narrator’s personal opinion into the story to really show his personality. A third person narrator may be impartial to the hotel room, but the narrator, who is characterized as having high tastes, is absolutely revolted by it. The key to first person is weaving the character into the narrative, which is why it’s very, very important to have an interesting character when doing the first person; if your character doesn’t have a unique way of seeing the world, then they’re not a good character to be using first person with.Hope this helped! Good luck!

Just a friendly reminder that writing is not always a linear process. That is, it rarely works out that you have an idea, then do a first draft, then edit that draft, then celebrate. The writing process itself is often an act of discovery, and can be messy and “inefficient.”You may write your first draft and realize it has major holes, causing you to need to return to your outline, correct the issue, and re-approach your draft.You may discover that the character you thought was your main character is not your main character. It’s actually her sister, and now you need to rewrite your story.You may change your point of view character several times before landing on the right one.You may write 9 drafts of your story only to realize the fundamental concept is flawed, bringing you back to the drawing board.You might throw away hundreds of pages.If you’re writing a novel, you might outline, then draft, then re-outline, then re-draft several times before you even get a solid handle on where you’re going with your story.You might write four different endings before you decide which one works best for your story.You might remove characters, combine characters, add characters.…all of this is normal. If this is happening to you, you’re not doing anything wrong. You’re a writer, and this is what writing is like sometimes. Sure, some writers seem to be able (or claim to be able) to write more quickly and efficiently. But there’s no sense in comparing yourself to them, and most of them are lying anyway. Instead of criticizing yourself, try to become curious about and embrace your process. There’s something awesome about how mysterious and unpredictable writing can be!

            How to Get More Clicks on your Fanfiction        B/c for some godless reason, I managed to get a piece of trash fic moderate popularity over on ff.net, so I might as well teach some of you people how to fake it til you make it. Plus, I can’t tell you how many times I didn’t read a perfectly good fic just because either something in the title, description, or format destroyed whatever interest I had. I’m going to split this up into 3 sections: Title, Summary, and Format.  Title: Either write the title with proper capitalization or none at all. By “Proper Capitalization,” I mean capitalizing every word in the title except for prepositions (to, on, with, by, etc), pronouns (your, her, him, etc), or article adjectives (a, an, the). The only exception are if they are at the start of the title or the pronoun “I.”All lower case titles are usually really long, like song lyrics, and for shorter works of fiction. Just please, for the love of God, don’t just 
capitalize the first word and leave the rest in lower case, that looks so lazy, please.Length is also important, so try one that reflects your story’s tone. Long titles give the impression that the work is more poetic and prose, while one word titles seem very serious. Metaphors and similes can seem pretentious while titles of popular songs are overused and cliche (Example: search “Angel with a Shotgun” on ff.net.) You want the title to be memorable. Song titles and lyrics are fine, but only if they have to do with your fic. No one actually cares either way, but it still helps to set the tone of the story.Summary: Please, for the love of all that is holy, write a damn summary. Don’t leave it blank for only the tags to explain, don’t just write “Read and find out,” just write a damn summary. Your readers want to know what the story is about. People like different things and no matter how good your title is, it’s not going to help people determine if they’re clicking a horror story or a romantic comedy. Also, stop writing things like “I suck at summaries!!! :(” No. Bad writer. If you admit you suck at summaries, then you basically admit you’re bad at writing. That’s probably not true, but to the average reader, it’s the same thing. Have confidence. If your story contains a certain AU that’s extremely popular (For example: Coffee-house AUs), then mention them in the summary, especially if there are no tags like FF.net. Place it at the end of the summary so the potential reader will have to read the entire summary to get there, increasing the chances they’ll read. Quotes are… overused, but that’s understandable. The writer wants to showcase their writing, and in many cases the quotes they choose do exactly that. Just make sure you choose good ones that showcase the story. Is it a comedy? Funny quote. Is it a romance? Kissy quote. Is it horror? Scary quote.If you want your summary to just be this quote, then… you can, but it’s the same as being vague unless it’s a REALLY good quote.In terms of placement, it’s up to you to place it at the beginning or the end. Read it out loud to see which sounds better. Just don’t be a weirdo and put it in the middle.Do not mislead people in summaries. Do not describe the story as lovely fluff if someone gets murdered in the opening paragraph. Do not mislead the audience, for the audience has pitchforks and fire. Always do a last minute read-over of your summary for spelling and grammar. No text speech unless it’s a text fic.FormatPARAGRAPHSYOU NEED PARAGRAPHSWHEN YOU CHANGE LOCATION, TIME, OR SPEAKER, PLEASE GO TO A NEW PARAGRAPH. It doesn’t matter if paragraphs are only one sentence long. It doesn’t matter if paragraphs are one word long. We’re not in grade school, you don’t need 5 sentences per paragraph anymore. In fact, kill the idea of long paragraph after long paragraph forever. Readers need variation in sentence structure and paragraph structure. A short sentence after an extremely long sentence feels like a breath of fresh air; it’s the same thing with paragraphs.While writing in certain tenses isn’t as noticeable as the whole paragraph thing, if you start in past tense, try to keep it in past tense. If you started in 3rd persona point of view, don’t switch to 1st halfway through the story.Keep excessive author’s notes at the bottom unless they are urgent, like you’re in the hospital and you won’t be updating for a few months. EDIT: Or if you are not a native English speaker. As long as you mention that, most people will be a lot more forgiving of spelling and grammar mistakes (Some people will even volunteer to beta for you!).Excessive misspellings and grammar mistakes. Buy a spelling checker, find a beta reader, just please don’t constantly misspell common words and write only in sentence fragments. Pretend you’re going to publish your fic if you have to, just dont right lik dis.
