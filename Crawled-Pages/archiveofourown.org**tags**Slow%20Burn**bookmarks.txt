    Summary
      Will is captured during the war and made a personal servant of the King, Hannibal Lecter. He has heard from his friends who were sentenced to the fighting pits that if they win one hundred battles, they earn their freedom. He decides to attempt the same; one hundred nights with Hannibal, earning his favor, so that he can be free. Of course, life in a castle, and serving Hannibal, is far more complicated than that.

    Summary
  “What’s your favorite rule, Lan Zhan?” Wei Wuxian asked abruptly, leaning across the space between their desks and staring up into his eyes. “I mean, you’ve lived here your whole life, you’ve gotta have a favorite.”
  Lan Wangji didn’t have to think about it. “Speak meagerly, for too many words bring harm.”
  Wei Wuxian stared at him, then let loose a surprised laugh and reared back, hands clasped together in delight.
Wei Wuxian is distracting, in every way.

      He opened his eyes to a gradient of green and a lingering feeling that something was wrong.A sound to his left make his ear flick - he pushed down another spike of panic. Since when did his ears flick in the direction of sounds? - and he levered himself off the ground, pulling himself up with the help of a nearby tree root. He didn't know where he was, didn't know who, or what, was out there. It wasn't safe to just hang about in the open, not with-Not with what? The thought teased at him, slipping out of his mind like smoke between fingers every time he tried to remember. Not with what?

    Summary
      The start of Jaskier's winter position at court is celebrated with a grand ball dedicated the artists brought in for the winter. But not all goes as planned when another guest recognizes him. Backed against the wall and faced with the threat of marriage, he spits out the first lie to comes to his mind and claims he is already married - to Geralt, of all people. To his immense surprise, Geralt goes along with it. In doing so, he commits to spending the winter by Jaskier's side and playing the doting husband. It's fortunate he does, because court seems more dangerous than Jaskier remembered. Monsters lurk in the corners and danger lurks behind every door. Without Geralt there, he might have been frightened. With Geralt, he's more concerned by his own growing feelings for the witcher. Can he get through the winter without Geralt catching on?

    Summary
      When Draco’s cover is blown during a deep undercover operation and the Ministry is compromised, Ron takes Draco to the only safe place he can think of—Potter. Hiding out with a taciturn Harry Potter, who has been missing from the Wizarding World for almost two decades after a shocking fall from grace, is nothing like Draco thought it would be. Draco has to navigate dealing with this Potter while being hunted by Dark wizards and wanted by extremists in the Ministry. When things take a turn for the worse, Draco has to decide whether he's going to keep running or find a way to protect the world and the people he cares about most.

    Summary
      It's been twenty-two years since the birth of Jung Jaehyun, fifth of the Living Gods. Twenty-two years since he was set in the arms of the old, blind Mother Superior, twenty-two years since his perfect grace and beauty restored her sight.Constantly covered by a veil and walking in utter silence he is never seen, never heard, never touched. Only his loyal cavalier is allowed past his walls, only the church can dictate how he spends his time. Jaehyun is obedient. Dutiful. Grateful to his people.Trapped.

    Summary
      He’d been watching this woman for months now. The Robin Hood wannabe who went only by the Scavenger, using her unique skill-set to defend the undercity’s most vulnerable while also robbing the rich blind. He’d seen her take out goons double their size and she’d escaped his grasp more times than he cared to admit. There was no doubt in his mind that she could handle them well enough on her own.But he’d been waiting here for hours just to land a punch or two. There was no way he was going to let her have all the fun.“Oh, somebody’s getting lucky tonight.” His raspy, modulated voice echoed down from the shadows above. “But it won’t be any of you.”

      (“You’re not sleeping,” Mai says softly.“How’d you know?” Zuko asks. To be honest, he’s kind of gotten to the point where he’s surprised that anyone can perceive him outside of his necessary functions- he exists solely to sit in council meetings and shoulder the blame for genocides and famines and the suffering of one-hundred years. Doesn’t he?)The war is over, but the fallout is just beginning. And where lightning strikes, thunder is bound to follow.

    Summary
      What happens when you’re forced to become the very thing you despise? 
Ex-Auror Harry Potter, tossed out of the Ministry for something he had no control over, has been looking for a way back to his former life. When he comes across Draco Malfoy in the criminal underbelly of Wizarding London and in need of protection, Harry figures bringing him in to face the Ministry's justice is his ticket back to everything he's lost. 
But nothing is exactly as it seems. Not even Harry himself. And as he gets drawn further and further into Malfoy's world of honour and deception he finds himself questioning everything he thought he knew—about his childhood nemesis, the Ministry job he misses so much, and most of all, about himself. 
What happens when you’re forced to see that you were wrong?
