    Summary
      Young Tsuna found a cursed mirror after school and ever since then his world was filled with these oddly shaped monsters. Now, he was not a jujutsu sorcerer. He has merely seen too much weird shit to give a damn anymore. Well, he can probably blame it on his environment, especially when said bad influence came in the form of one Zenin Toji.

    Summary
      Death the Kid isn't human. When it comes to fighting mysterious witches and going up against powerful magical weapons, this is an advantage. In relationships however... not so much. With powerful enemies moving against the D.W.M.A. and madness threatening to rip them apart from within, Kid and the team must work together to navigate the strange powers, quirks, and culture of being a death god lest the academy and the world end.Post anime because the manga wrapped up too nicely for more stories.Updates Weekly

      In the darkness, it was impossible to see which ship had arrived or make out the faces of the men below. It was only when they entered the squares of light cast from the windows they passed that their faces were discernible.Ed saw Kenway as he walked past a window. The short glimpse showed a tired, weary man, with a crease between his brows that hadn’t been there before. His steps were slow, and heavy.
A continued series of encounters and moments between Thatch and Kenway.

    Summary
      Kageyama Tobio only loves a few things in life: computers, movies, and interacting with other people as little as possible. So when he meets hotel employee Hinata Shouyou on a work trip and doesn't immediately hate him, it comes as something of a shock. Hinata is everything Tobio isn't—outgoing, worldly, and sexy AF. Even more surprising is the part where Hinata seems to be just as interested in him in return, plunging Tobio into the kind of whirlwind attraction he's only ever seen in films, and certainly never experienced for himself.  Tobio doesn't know why Hinata would want anything to do with him, but he can't stop himself from falling for Hinata's movie star-level charisma… and the air of mystery that surrounds him. Because for all their chemistry, there's something holding Hinata back, making him push Tobio away. But Tobio is used to keeping people at arm's length, so he might be able to figure out how to get Hinata to let his guard down—and prove that he can be more than just some nerd Hinata met on the job.

    Summary
      About a century ago animals began to mutate, becoming aggressive and bloodthirsty creatures called Infected whose one bite is enough to kill... or infect. These monsters decimated a large part of the world's population and forced humans to hide underground to survive all this time but some people are able to fight them. They assemble into groups and go to the surface to hunt these monsters, like the Mugiwaras. Everything was going well for them, until they met Law, who was bitten several days ago.

      Without thinking, she frantically pulled his shirt out of the belt to try and see the damage to his chest and stomach. His hand halted her movements."I am quite alright, I assure you," he said gently. She didn't believe him, and she quickly continued, fearing a law suit coming rushing her way."Really, miss, there is no need for,-"Too late, she had revealed his skin. It was as white as his hands, but seemed unharmed. Her fingers skimmed the slightly damp spot on his skin, where she knew hot tea had hit him. Not so much as a red irritation showed. Impossible."As I told you," he said, a soft chuckle surfacing. "I am quite alright." This is an AU where Bella does not know of the existence of vampires.AU where Bella wants to study art. She goes to Italy, to live, oblivious to the existence of vampires, and takes an art course. It gets intense in more ways than one. Her teacher is none other than Marcus, who patiently teaches her the theory of colours and much much more.

    Summary
      "The truth poured on her like a deluge, seeping into her mind, filling in each crack of doubt and unearthing every root of denial. She never felt so hollow, and now she knew why.
She was alone."
What if Spinel was a lot less competent, and after failing to steal an injector or a rejuvenator, finds herself at the wrong address to boot? Instead of savior of the galaxy, the homicidal pink gem finds herself tied to the depressed, self-destructive human, Dusty? 
(Not a self-insert or reader surrogate fic. I wanted to explore the idea of instead of Spinel finding comfort and healing in another just as damaged as her — a la Pink Pearl — she found someone whose broken edges were a little more sharp. There’s no smut in this whatsoever and never will be. Sex will be mentioned and referenced, but never detailed.)

    Summary
      Opus = an artistic work, especially one on a large scale.You had been the right hand of Snoke for years before he came along. Snoke had disregarded you like a child with a new toy. It hurt, but not as much as the pain you had experienced in the past. Now, awakened once more, you are brought to the forefront of the battle, to teach Kylo Ren what it means to be a true warrior of the Sith.

    Summary
      “I’ll be the fire that burns every last Necromonger to ashes.”In the past, those words would’ve caused Vaako to laugh, but the ice in Khan’s eyes, the way those words resonated through Vaako’s body, shattered any vestigial pride he’d had left for the Necromonger empire. In that moment he had no doubt that Khan would, and could, do just that. Part 2 of From The Darkness.
