                 Mini Bio
                My name is Emily Horner. I live in Brooklyn, I'm a librarian, and I write YA books. My first book, "A Love Story Starring My Dead Best Friend," is out June 10th, 2010.I am takumashii on livejournal, a name that proved exceedingly embarrassingly when I learned more Japanese than I knew in 2000 when I registered the account. Opinions are my own and do not reflect those of my employer or my publishers.
