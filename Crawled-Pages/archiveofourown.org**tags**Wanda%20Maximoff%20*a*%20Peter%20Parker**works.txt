    Summary
      Its summer break for Peter, which gives Tony an idea - instead of letting him waste his summer away indoors (he knows he wouldn't), how about letting him join the Avengers? The team will surely take care of him! However, in the process, Peter surprisingly ends up growing closest with the red-clad girl few people dare to approach, except the team. Let's find out how. (Everyone is happy-AU! :))

    Summary
      “Quick rundown.” Tony said fast, “This place is famous for its suicides.”Clint sang, “Terrific.”“Bruce and Bucky are missing, and they were acting weird.” He held up a hand, silencing Clint’s remarks, “And yes, weirder than usual.”  TLDR: After pulling over at a motel, for the night, the team undergoes strange experiences, that seems to be out to claim the lives of the people closest to them - Tony is sure, that Peter is sleepy soundly, throughout the ordeal..

    Summary
      Wanda Maximoff doesn't know what to expect after becoming an Avenger. As she trains and learns to be more comfortable in her new environment, Tony suddenly assigns her a mission - one nobody else can do, much to Natasha's dismay. Wanda is sent to high school. Specifically, she is sent to befriend and possibly recruit Peter Parker. As her mission starts, though, she begins to feel as if something is being kept from her...what are Natasha and Tony hiding from her?

    Summary
      Peter Benjamin Parker was your average, awkward, middle-class, nerdy teen from queens.Peter 'Junior' Parker Antonio Potts-Stark was your unfairly attractive, snarky, genius son of Tony and Pepper Potts-Stark and younger brother to the adopted Wanda Maximoff-Stark. He's been groomed since birth to take over a Fortune 500 company, definitely DOESN'T have a crush on his friend Princess Shuri no matter what Wanda says. Oh and yeah he's Spider-Man. The two boys are completely different yet the same person. No one is meant to find out about Peter Parker's little secret until he's 18. But when a nosy reporter leaks a video of Spider-Man taking of his mask and calling Tony Stark dad, well... things get a little complicated.The early chapters are more based on Pepperony, the circumstances of Peter's birth and baby Peter before the main plot begins.This is my first story so it might be bad, I take constructive criticism but please be nice.

    Summary
      When Howard Stark dies, his five remaining sons and daughters reunite for his funeral, one having vanished and one being dead. It's a bittersweet, mostly bitter reunion. But when their missing brother appears, babbling about an apocalypse, the Starks must figure out how to get over their trauma and band together in order to stop it.Or: Steve, with super strength and ape-like body, spent his life trying to impress Howard, and was banished to the moon. Tony, controlling metal, especially attuned a suit he built, is a dropout from police academy and working at a fight ring for a room, Natasha is in a custody battle with her husband over her daughter (who she was using her rumoring powers on), Stephen, teleporter and time traveller, just wants a cup of coffee and to save the world, Wanda just wants to be noticed by her siblings, Peter is debating over sobriety and making the desecrated ghosts disappear and Bruce, well the ghost of Bruce at least, is just trying to keep Peter alive and sober while keeping the ghostly Hulk under wraps. Or: The Umbrella Academy AU that no one wanted but I wrote anyway

    Summary
      Take a paper…. crumple it, now try to flatten it out and mend it back to how it was. Were you able to???You mended it but it will never be the same. But it’s still usable.Now take a new sheet of paper, tear it to pieces. Now try to mend it, were you able to??? Probably not. You might have used tape, glue or some other adhesives but it’ll never be the same, it’ll never be secure, you’ll never be able to use it.______________________________________________________ It all started when Evelyn moved to queens. Her life was hell before this but she was used to it…..however now it was worse. This was the end…….

    Summary
      He's not coming. If I wasn't such a burden to him before maybe he would have helped me now. Maybe he would come pick me up and everything would be okay. But everything's not okay because I ruined everything. I should have lied more. I shouldn't have talked to my counselor. This. Shouldn't. Be. Happening.

    Summary
      Wanda Maximoff lost everything from a young age. Her parents, freedom and childhood. After her brother's death, she feels as though she truly has lost everything, even herself. She's scared of losing control, she's scared of her past coming back to haunt her and she's scared of a life without her brother. Luckily...there's a certain group of superheroes who happen to be in her corner to guide her, as well as another young Avenger, known as Peter Parker, to show her the meaning of friendship...and maybe even love.Follow the story of Wanda, as she settles in to life at the Avenger's tower/compound and learns how to recover from her traumatic past.I suck a summaries, so please just read.Will progress in to a Natasha &amp; Wanda heavy fic...because who doesn't love them.Basically just a slightly domestic Avengers taking care of a slightly younger Wanda and Peter.

    Summary
      There was an idea. To bring together a group of remarkable people. A group of people who could fight battles ordinary people could never dream of winning. This group was originally made of six persons: Tony Stark, Natasha Romanov, Bruce Banner, Clint Barton, Steve Rogers and Thor Odinson. There was absolutely nothing ordinary about these persons who were in charge of protecting the world. They had saved Earth several times and had even saved the universe a couple of times, with the help of other superheroes. They represented hope and safety for the citizens of Earth. They were called the Avengers.This should be a day as any other day. However, robots attack New-York City and the Avengers are nowhere to be found.
