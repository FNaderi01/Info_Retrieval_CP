    Summary
      Katsuki Bakugou is eight years old, he has no idea how he got here, where he is, or who this other kid is with him, but that's not gonna stop him from being brave and tough, just like the hero he's gonna be when he's older!The universe has other ideas, but Katsuki Bakugou is a child made of spite, hubris, determination, and way too much nitroglycerin, so the universe can take it's ideas and shove 'em. After all, nobody out-stubborns Katsuki.  Nobody.

    Summary
      Miles let go. Peter B. Parker closed his eyes as he dropped back through the rift, heading home. It would have been nice if he’d ended up there. Instead, the veteran hero makes an unintended pit stop in another Peter's universe - one where he's an Avenger, of all things.(Takes place in the MCU, post-hypothetical-Avengers 4)

    Summary
      AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR SPOILERS (READ AS - DEATHS) - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED  The cosmic branches of Yggdrasil flutter in the shock-waves created by Thanos. Along them travels a recently deceased Loki, fully intent on marshaling an army of the vengeful dead—among the cast out warriors he can coerce, at least. After all, Hel is unguarded. There's just one problem. Loki did not expect to go to Valhalla.

"Sure they did, gramps," Tony Stark says.
"Peter Jason Quill, they took him in 1988," Gregg says. "Couldn't you talk to your friend? The big blond from space, the one with the hammer, maybe he could ask around for me."

    Summary
      Sakaar is a planet with plenty of recreational substances to use and abuse. Which is fine, sort of. The problem comes when you leave. 
Or, the one where a problem Loki didn't really think about becomes a problem Loki really has to think about. Or, drug withdrawal in space.
