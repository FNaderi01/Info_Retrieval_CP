                 Mini Bio
                I'm a 27 year old Aussie girl who spends more time on the internet than I do out in the real world. (Introvert with a pinch of OCD &amp; a dash of Social Anxiety, what more can I say?)I watch more shows than I have time for but I read fic for a couple of them. I dabble in writing my own fan fiction. Most of what I write will never seen the light of day though. My list of ships (both het &amp; slash) is as long as my arm &amp; then some! Call me a ship whore, I don't mind :DI also love video games! PS3 is my platform of choice, I have a weakness for open world games &amp; my current obsession is 'The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim'. (You can stick that 'arrow to the knee' bullshit up your ass though. I've only heard that in game once &amp; it was nothing special. My favourite line is "What is it? Dragons?" just so you know.)Tom Hiddleston is my Lord and Master. He owns me heart and soul right now.
