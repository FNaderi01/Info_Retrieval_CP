In Edinmumble for EuroPy(th)(C)onJul. 20th, 2018 10:33 pm
rhialtoSo next week the EuroPython is happening. It looks like I'll have a free day on monday. I am carefully studying the weather forecasts and the predictions for when it will rain and when it will not are still changing... I do hope monday will be nice. It will certainly be cold, though, around 20°C, when at the same time it will be more like 30°C in Berlin...
