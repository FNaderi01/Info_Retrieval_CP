    Summary
      It's 410 AD. Rome has withdrawn from Britain at last, leaving uneasy truces between the tribes. The Sea Wolves are invading from the East and there is a plot afoot to rid Albion of undesirables - Fae folk, Picts, and the second son of King Robert. Liam, a poor but deserving woodcutter's son, has an unexpected chance to change the path of destiny and foil such dastardly plots. With the help of a bitter dryad named Zayn and an exceedingly odd Sidhe named Harry, Liam might be able to save a king and find love into the bargain.

    Summary
  "By the Heavens, did you hear? The Yiling Patriarch has been invited to the Discussion Conference in Qinghe!"
Gossip was, by far, the fastest way for information to spread.  "What! Whose idea was that!?"It was not the most accurate or most reliable method, but people were people, and the tedium of daily life would always bore them.  "I heard it was the Nie Sect leader's suggestion."----------After thirteen years in the Burial Mounds, the Yiling Patriarch finally makes a public reappearance. Civilians are scared. Cultivators are outraged. Sect Leaders are concerned. Wei Wuxian has been too quiet, they say, and nobody knows what dark horrors the Burial Mounds may now contain.Wei Wuxian wouldn't quite call them dark horrors, but the description wasn't too far off.(tl;dr Wei Wuxian lives, raises a whole gaggle of demonic cultivator children, and the cultivation world panics.)----------[Español][Français][русский язык]
