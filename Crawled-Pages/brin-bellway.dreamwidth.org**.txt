My laptop's normal-power-cord-to-weird-laptop-socket adapter is deteriorating faster than the replacement is shipping (we don't already have any compatible spares lying around), and is now more or less unusable. This post is brought to you by a commandeered TV brain.(I'm not actually trying to use the TV itself: I unplugged the brain's various umbilicals and moved it to my couch.)((damn, check out *that* out-of-context quote))I do not relish the thought of using this as my primary computer for 5 - 18 days--not only is setup a pain, it's too low-spec to be *capable* of the same setup as my own laptop--but at least it should be enough to study with.---I *really* hope it is indeed the adapter that's failing and not the socket: sockets are *much* harder to fix. But adapters historically fail much more often than sockets, this increasingly-finicky-positioning symptom is characteristic of a failing adapter, and the adapter does seem very suspiciously wiggly in its own right (the metal bits not attached to the plastic bits as firmly as they should be). So it *is* probably a $6 delivery fix rather than a $[large-number] in-person fix....just as soon as the delivery shows up.

I learned about Recoll today while looking for a way to search ~50 chat-log ODT documents for a particular exchange, and oh my god it's amazing.It totally did handle that situation, but it also handles *so* many other file formats. EPUB, HTML, Thunderbird, *things inside zipped folders* (7-zip too, if you install the right plugin!), just to name a few. I tried a search for "backpack" and got hits from chat logs, fanfics, ebooks, blogs, wikis, emails...And there's search syntax, to let you exclude stuff with certain words or restrict it to a particular directory and all that.I have acquired my own private search engine! That is a thing, that exists, right now, that you can just download off Synaptic like it's no big deal and not something beyond Vannevar Bush's wildest dreams!

Adventures in walkie-talkie appsAug. 24th, 2020 12:03 pm
Apps that think the distinguishing feature of a walkie-talkie, as opposed to a cell phone or VoIP line--the thing that makes you say "what we need right now is a walkie-talkie"--is "push to talk" rather than "infrastructureless": no, go away.(honestly, I'm not actually firmly attached to being able to "talk" *at all*. it's a nice bonus, might come in handy occasionally, but text-only would be fine.)Briar: Aimed at dissidents getting their Internet shut down by the government, so the level of security is overkill for my needs and sometimes comes at the cost of features more useful to me (like having multiple devices under the same account). Doesn't seem to have multihop even in group chats, *severely* limiting the range (can't even communicate with someone two floors down in the same house). However, can make use of Internet if it's available to both parties. Has a Linux client in beta, which is nice: if I have to choose one OS for offline texting to work on, I'll pick Android for its portability, but being able to type on my laptop keyboard would certainly be good.(Also, drains the battery pretty hard, at least in Bluetooth mode. I'm lucky to get 24 hours of standby time out of it, when usually I can get nearly a week of standby. Admittedly this probably says more about how many of my smartphone's capabilities I normally keep turned off than it does about Briar, and someone who was going to have Bluetooth on anyway might not find the difference significant.)Serval: Great idea, well aligned with my needs and desires, but it's still in alpha after nearly a decade of development. Apparently it's not completely abandoned, but progress is very, *very* slow. I have subscribed to their blog and will be following them with interest.Firechat: People talk wistfully about it, but nobody seems to know where to find a reputable APK. It's not on Google Play anymore, and it was never on F-Droid.Bridgefy: ...okay, I guess *technically* an offline-messaging app that *requires Internet during the installation process* is not 100% useless, but it's *far* less useful than it could be, and I am deeply uncomfortable with the fragility implications of "during a disaster, the mesh is irreplaceable and inextensible". As I've said previously, I generally consider it a dealbreaker in *any* software to require Internet during the installation process, unless the whole purpose of the software is to interact with the Internet. I might grudgingly use it if there were zero other options, but I'll pick almost anything over a cloud-dependent version.Also their data-collection policies felt kind of shady to me, certainly by comparison to the utopian non-profits making most of the other stuff on this list.IPFS: Despite the talk about "diversely resilient networks that enable persistent availability — with or without Internet backbone connectivity", from what I can tell IPFS in its current state is *not* distributed, merely decentralised. That is to say, you can talk to your peers rather than going through a server, but you must talk to said peers over the Internet. Distributedness is #4 on the IPFS team's long-term to-do list: for scale, note that in 2019 they attempted one item off the to-do list and didn't manage to complete it by the end of the year. It was a big project and I'm not blaming them, but I do figure the completion of item #4 is going to be a while.I like how they think, though: their planned Internet fails gracefully not just in the face of loss of connectivity, but in the face of linkrot as well. I have installed a node on my laptop, which I expect to be very occasionally useful at first and gradually more useful over time. (They say file-sharing works well right now: I might make use of that.) I have also subscribed to their newsletter.(There are two IPFS apps for Android, one of which crashes immediately on startup and one of which requires Android 8+. That's the first app I've encountered to require an Android version later than my current 7. If *I* can't afford an Android version later than 7, it's going to be a while until people living in shacks on little Pacific islands--Serval's initial target audience--can do it.)Berty: In alpha--actually, maybe not quite even that--but development seems to be more active than on Serval. Very similar to Briar, but without the ability to use Internet if available. Unclear whether it's going to have multihop, the only way it could be better than Briar. (well, okay, not the *only* way, I guess there's *something* to be said for iOS and Windows compatibility) I have subscribed to their newsletter.goTenna: Why do I need a whole other piece of hardware--that costs as much as a smartphone itself! each!--when there are so many transmitters already packed into an ordinary smartphone? None of those--nor the *combination* of them--were good enough? *Really*?(And excuses about "longer range" are going to have to be pretty damn good excuses, given that for the kind of money they're charging for a two-pack I could buy...*checks*...six cheap smartphones to use as mesh nodes, *and* I'd be able to recruit Android-using neighbours into the mesh just by offering them an APK to sideload.Actually, no, no excuses about "longer range" are good enough. Dedicated long-range mesh hardware should *complement* smartphone-based mesh nodes, not replace them.)Also, buggy as hell apparently.---Iron star for Most Usable As-Is: Briar. Plan to keep it Internet-connected as much as possible, but unlike other Internet-based texting apps it fails *somewhat* gracefully in the Internet's absence.Mithril star for Closest Match Between Their Aspirations and Mine: IPFS, with an honourable mention to Serval.

Speaking of de-googling, a milestone:This backup cycle, I didn't perform a Google Takeout because there was nothing to take.My spreadsheets are now local files accessed through Gnumeric. I've moved my email and calendar to mailbox.org, with the email accessed through Thunderbird (and a custom domain, to reserve the right to move again if I wish). While I haven't yet set up an automatic sync between my phone and laptop contact lists, Google isn't the master copy anymore: Thunderbird is. I made the local software library I've been wanting, which doubles as a list of apps I have. There's really nothing important in the Chromium settings I barely use: it's not worth taking if I'm not throwing it in with a bunch of other stuff (and probably not even then).The only thing on Google worth archiving now is my set of Google Play app reviews, and that changes much less often than fortnightly.

As a side effect of my projects to take more control over my digital life (in this case, de-googling my email), brinbellway.net is now a live domain. For the foreseeable future it redirects to brin-bellway.dreamwidth.org: if the location of my primary Internet presence changes, I'll update it accordingly.---If we know each other and you'd like to exchange email addresses, just ask. I was surprised and a little concerned by just how *few* people there were to send the change-of-address-notice email out to.(This is a techy enough social sphere that somebody might very well ask, and the answer is that I don't have a PGP key *yet*. I'm waiting for Thunderbird to finish implementing their PGP integration: apparently they released the beta last month. I'll leave the beta testing to people who already have experience working with PGP.)
