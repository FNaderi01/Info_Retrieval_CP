  Almost perfect, almost!
      So. It‚Äôs very rare that I leave a review on apps, but this one deserves it. I have been having an absolute blast with this, especially since I‚Äôve really gotten into drone photography and it‚Äôs the perfect tool to make for video editing. My favorite feature honestly is making the movie trailers, it‚Äôs so fun with a compilation of media. The ONLY issue I have with it is that I‚Äôd love more freedom. Once you pick the general theme it predetermines what you can do. It boxes you into a certain amount of clips per section and has a variety of different kinds that you cant control whatsoever. So for example. One section in the trailer would have 3 slots for clips. The first one would be a .9 second, the next one would be a 3 second closeup (which is very annoying since it zooms way in on the picture or video and there‚Äôs nothing you can do to adjust it or stop it.) so if it‚Äôs a video it could focus in and cut out what you actually want to show in the clip which makes it impossible to use a lot of media. The third one could be 1.5 seconds.The fact that you can‚Äôt change the number of possible clips in a section and that you can‚Äôt change the duration of any of the clips is very frustrating.But beyond that this is an AMAZING app that I will love using for a long time, definitely worth having to be more strategic on what media I place where.

  Great, But Here is a Suggestion
      Yes, iMovie is a great movie and trailer or film maker, you can make retro trailers/films/movies, romance, teens, family, fairy tale, swashbuckler, expedition, superhero, scary, coming of age, indie, Bollywood, adrenaline, and narrative movies films or trailers. I know, a lot of options üòÖ.But... There should be an option where you can change the music and where you can have the images and videos you took on iMovie only be stored in the movies on your app, not the gallery. It is a huge waste of space for your device, especially if you make lots of movies/trailers like me. I wish you could make the trailers longer than a minute, and can make it 1-4 minutes at least for trailers. When making a trailer, you can‚Äôt hear any talking or sounds just music. Maybe still keep the music, because that is still cool, but make there a setting where you can turn off music and can hear talking and sounds. Still a very great app I recommend, but I am just hoping for an update that will change that and further experience in the update. I hope this is good enough to explain the change I‚Äôd be grateful for and to explain to others who might download this app. Please make this change though, if not, it‚Äôs fine but thx anyways ‚ò∫Ô∏è

  LOVE IT
      This....is......the......best......editing......software.....I‚Äôve....ever....use.Other editing apps make everything over complicated by making it look all ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù or ‚Äúeasy‚Äù. Some apps make it so you can‚Äôt find anything and you have to enter all these strange unhelpful commands while others all you can do is plop the video in, put in a filter, and maybe add some random sounds. But this app is so good! You can do so much with it, it‚Äôs super easy, AND if you are willing to spice things up you can put it into pro mode where you can do even more! It‚Äôs even better because IT HAS A FRICKING UNDO BUTTON! It‚Äôs so helpful if you made a big mistake and you don‚Äôt want to have to do it all over again! It also has so many transitions that are so fun to play with along with the funny and awesome sound effects (my favorite it the time travel one) the only thing I have to complained about is that the default transition is fade and so I have to go through my entire video and put it to the standard one witch really annoys me I would also like a *BLEEP* sound effect because it‚Äôs so good for humor and if someone says...something... but other than that it‚Äôs so good and I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs only rated 3.9 stars WHEN IT CLEARLY DESERVES A 4.5! soooo yea that‚Äôs all I have to say!
