			Is social and emotional learning the missing piece in education reform, or is it just another fad that will distract education reformers from ensuring that students are prepared academically for what lies ahead?
Grover “Russ” Whitehurst, argues that those looking for a body of evidence to support the recommendations of social and emotional learning advocates will be sorely disappointed.
His new article, “A Prevalence of ‘Policy-Based Evidence-Making‘,” is part of an EdNext forum on social and emotional learning.
The EdNext Podcast is available on Apple Podcasts, Google Play, Soundcloud, Stitcher and here every Wednesday.
