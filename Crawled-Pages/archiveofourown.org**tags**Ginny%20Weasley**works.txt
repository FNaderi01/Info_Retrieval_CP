    Summary
      It's been seven and a half years since the Battle at Hogwarts.For the last six and half years, Severus Snape has been living a rather uneventful life as the DADA teacher and Deputy Headmaster at Hogwarts. That all changed when Hermione Granger-Weasley gave an interview to Witch Weekly that she was seeking a divorce and then in two days showing up at Hogwarts looking and behaving drastically different. Minerva has appointed her a post as the Muggle Studies Professor for now. Suddenly Severus felt himself getting drawn in and wrapped up in the affairs of a woman he had desperately been avoiding for those six years. He knew there was more to this divorce than met the eye, and he was determined to uncover why the woman he remembered when he woke up from death's door had changed so much. What he would uncover would change his view of her, and he would be forced to admit a secret he long since buried and given up on.But first, Severus had to determine why she was being so peculiar.

    Summary
      A Drinny story set during HBP. Ginny senses Draco Malfoy is up to something when she catches him in the corridors looking like he's been crying. She decides to follow him, and finds out that he is hiding the Dark Mark. Only now, she doesn't know if she can tell anyone his secret. I've used the archive warning "underage" since they are technically in 5th and 6th year, and there's a bit of snogging down the road. Enjoy!
