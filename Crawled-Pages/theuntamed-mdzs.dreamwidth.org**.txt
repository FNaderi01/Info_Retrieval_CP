elwendellI was just running a spell check on a story when it came to MoXuanYu.  It's suggested replacement?  Homosexual.  I nearly spit out my coffee.

Icon RequestOct. 3rd, 2020 11:16 am
elwendellWould anyone be interested in making me an icon for The Untamed?  In the scene at the secret cold pond LanZhan plays the first notes on the ancient Qin and we get an amazing image of him, white robes floating about him, against a blue background.  Is anyone willing to find a screenshot and make that for me?   I don't write love scenes but would be willing to exchange for a drabble of your choice.

"You're just going to have to pretend very hard. Don't let him break you."Or: The one where Wei Wuxian secretly adopts A-Yuan and when he tries to convince Lan Wangji he had a kid all along, Lan Wangji rolls with it, ups the ante, and sets off a game of chicken that digs up buried feelings that Wei Wuxian is 100% sure he's not going to act on. Okay, 90% sure.

Fic: Seasons in the SunSep. 18th, 2020 08:45 pm
dragonyphoenixTitle: Seasons in the SunFandom: Mo Dao Zu Shi / The Untamed &amp; Buffy the Vampire SlayerRating: GeneralRelationships: Jiang Cheng / Cordelia Chase (eventually)Characters (in this scene): Jiang Cheng, Wei WuxianTiming: Post Canon Edit: I can't believe I forgot the link. Story is here. Snippet: When Jiang Cheng finally found him, Wei Wuxian, dressed in his  ever-present black with a red ribbon tying his long black hair up into a  messy bun, was squatting by a small pool, poking a stick into the  water. “Why am I not surprised to find you stirring up mud?”Wei  Wuxian looked up with a wide grin. Jiang Cheng blinked back his  surprise. How could the man look so happy when he didn’t want to be  here?“Jiang Cheng, there was a toad, but now I can’t find it.”“It  was probably scared off by your ugly face.” Jiang Cheng scowled at his  own words. He’d meant to be nice. “Are you joining me for dinner or  not?”“Is it that late?”It hadn’t been when Jiang Cheng had started looking for him. “Almost.”Wei Wuxian tossed the stick away as he rose to his feet. “Okay.”Jiang  Cheng started walking back, only rolling his eyes when his back was  turned to his brother. He shouldn’t have gone looking for Wei Wuxian.  He’d bet a thousand pieces of gold that Lan fucking Wangji never had to  hunt him down for dinner.Wei Wuxian caught up and draped an arm  across Jiang Cheng’s shoulder. “Do you think there’ll be lotus soup?  I’ve missed it in Gusu.”Of course they’d serve lotus soup. Did  Wei Wuxian think his own brother had forgotten his favorite dishes?  Jiang Cheng shrugged but not enough to disturb the arm draped over his  shoulder. “How would I know?”
