    Creator Chose Not To Use Archive WarningsDave/Klaus HargreevesKlaus Hargreeves Dave (Umbrella Academy)Mutual Pining Idiots in Love College AU its never explicitly said but it's set there drunk klaus Cuddling &amp; Snuggling Oblivious
    Summary
      Dave was not going to go over there he wasn’t. Klaus was a fully-grown man he could handle himself. Even if he was almost black out drunk and the guy who was all over him didn’t look like he cared how drunk he was. Even if Klaus might do something he regrets. He won’t do it. He’s not Klaus’s fucking baby sitter.
