    Summary
      Five decided it was one of those “good news, bad news” situations. The good news was that the Hargreeves had made it back to 2019. The bad news was that there were now six dangerous strangers in their home. The worst news was the strange way Reginald was staring at Five.--- Set Post S2, the siblings are stuck in an alternate version of 2019, where the Umbrella Academy doesn’t exist. Five is mostly trying to avoid dealing with the trauma of watching his siblings die for the third time while trying to keep his family safe from Reggie and the Sparrow Academy.  The others, well…at least they’re trying.

    Summary
      After narrowly subverting the apocalypse, life returns to normal for the Hargreeves family. Unfortunately, this peace doesn't last long after Five follows Diego on a routine night mission that goes sideways in the worst way. The dysfunctional super siblings must now work as a team to try and put the pieces of their smallest member back together before he shatters completely beyond repair.

    Summary
      You would think that after stopping two separate apocalypses, dying twice, and traveling through time, that a break from the stress is exactly what all of the Hargreeve siblings would want, and that was exactly correct. Except for Five of course. His overactive brain was like a child who had no toys to play with, or in his case, no impending world demise to stop.orFive is bored and finds himself investigating a string of kidnappings...

    Summary
      “No one leaves until we figure this out,” Five snapped. 
Wordlessly, Luther grabbed him by the fabric of his sweater and blazer. He lifted his brother off his feet as if he weighed nothing and threw him sideways, tossed him over the side of the balcony. It happened so quickly that nobody moved to stop him- and maybe they wouldn't have anyway. They'd grown up with superpowers, pitted against each other in training sessions by their father, so they were all pretty accustomed to roughhousing. Knives were thrown as often as insults. They all knew Five was way too agile to be hurt so easily. 
More irritated than worried, Diego watched from the stairs as his older brother flew through the air in a perfect arch and then plummeted towards the ground. He knew that Five would just jump out of the way and reappear somewhere else- probably out in the alley, so that he could work off some steam. He always jumped out of the way, even before he'd fully mastered his power. Teleporting seemed instinctual to Five. So, Diego was stunned to watch as the boy just sunk like a stone in water.
There was a thump, followed by the sharp cracking of bone, as his body hit the floor of the shop.

      Five spends fifteen years in the apocalypse and two years working for the Temps Commission before breaking his contract and time traveling back to the year 2003; just a year after he originally went missing. According to his calculations, wiping Reginald's existence from the timeline means the apocalypse never occurs. But of course, this leaves several newly orphaned fourteen year olds in his care. Let the family bonding and therapy ensue.

    Summary
      Vanya is just your typical teenager, dealing with normal teenager things, homework, hormones, and too many emotions. But when her adopted sister/only friend starts ditching her to hang out with her new boyfriend Vanya needs some new friends. Enter Five, the slightly odd boy that lives down the street, who seems more than welcome to her friendship. Add on that weird things keep happening to Vanya and the world just seems too damn loud. Vanya finds herself suddenly way over her head and struggling to simply stay afloat.

    Summary
      Seven gasps awake. She finds Five straight away, their eyes locking.Then the Professor snatches her by the hair.“Now, as I said, I don’t plan on damaging any of you,” he says, unaware that his days are numbered. “But this one’s not exactly one of you, is she? And, well, we have to find something to pass the time with while we wait for your generous father to pay the ransom. I wouldn’t want any of you doing something rash, like trying to escape.”He looks directly at Five when he says this, and Five bares his teeth.“Oh, you’re a little feral one,” the Professor says cheerfully. “Scary."OR: The Umbrella Academy (plus Number Seven), at just eleven years old, have been kidnapped for a ransom by some guy who's really not messing around. At least they're all together? Five's having a very bad day, One's having an even worse time and Seven's kinda just happy to be included.

    Summary
      “You stay home all day and occasionally go outside with one of us. Come on, Five. Even I can see you really need a hobby.” He paused, “Like, really, really need a hobby.”The apocalypse is over, everyone is happy (or as happy as they can be), and the siblings all agree that Five really needs a hobby.(spoiler alert, he finds one) Or alternatively, me trying to fit Five Whump, wholesome sibling bonding, and ranting about music all into one fic. The only plot (so far) is following Five through his journey of finding and settling with a hobby.
