    Summary
      Not fifteen minutes on a new planet, Ace is arrested, imprisoned and tortured. Informed the Professor is either gone or is meeting the same fate, she makes plans for a final strike at the torturers. The Doctor is only told she has been committed to the same dreadful fate as the rest of the prisoners. He wants to get revenge, calculated but hot. Little do they know, they will meet again, and might be able to turn the tide on this planet away from the bleak present towards a more just future.

    Summary
      While listening to the They Might Be Giants album The Else on shuffle, I found myself having one inspiration after another, so a sort of variation on that shuffle drabbles theme seemed inevitable.1. The Mesopotamians, Sith afterlife, featuring characters from Darth Bane: Path Of Destruction2. The Shadow Government, a Chiss in NYC, with the 1971 movie that shares the band's name3. Take Out The Trash, Mother and small son take their leave from Cosinga, changing history4. With the Dark, Ariana is more than she seems...and even more to come
