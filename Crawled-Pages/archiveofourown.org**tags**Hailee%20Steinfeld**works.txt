      Hailee really thought she had closed the chapter Niall forever. She thought she had left him and their past behind and was ready to move forward. But then Niall's new album Heartbreak Weather got released and instead of listening to her friends to ignore it, Hailee sat down with her dog and wine and listened to every single song. And every single song has its history.

    Summary
      “You’re quite relaxed for someone who has a gun pointed at them.”
“You won’t shoot me.” Harry dares, hoping Hydrogen (or whatever his name is) can’t tell he’s shitting himself right now.
“Wanna bet?” the guy dares, a smirk spreading over his lips.
Okay, why did Harry think that talking back to a guy with tattoos all over his body and a gun in his hand would be a good idea?
---
‘Money Heist’/'La casa de papel' inspired AU. Louis Tomlinson is one of the most wanted criminals in the UK and Harry Styles is a law student who always did what his father told him to do, which includes interviewing for a job at the Bank of England. What Harry doesn’t know, is that his fear of standing up to his father will make him a hostage during the most notorious ten-day money heist in the history of the United Kingdom.
or
A heist!AU where Harry just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time because seven people are trying to pull off the biggest heist ever seen by mankind.

    Summary
      — Zapłacę ci sto tysięcy dolarów za jedną dobę ze mną — powiedział wysoki mężczyzna z lekko kręconymi włosami, który ubrany był w ekstrawagancki garnitur w kwiaty.— Przepraszam, nie jestem rzeczą, nie może mnie pan wykupić — parsknął Louis, następnie wskazując na bruneta, który stał przy stole do bilarda — a to mój chłopak.— Nie proponuję ci seksu za pieniądze, szanuję cię — zapewnił. — Zjemy tylko kolację na jachcie. Pomyśl... sto tysięcy za jedną dobę.— Nie może pan kupować ludzi, to dosyć-— A jeśli wytrzymasz ze mną tydzień, dam ci od ręki milion dolarów.

    Summary
      "You did! I just couldn't do that. It would have broken my heart to see you all hurt. It was easier to let you all hate me rather than break you.""Either way, you broke us." Zayn finally spoke up. "Everything we were supposed to do together, we didn't have you there.."Because see in this small town, everything you do, it gets noticed. Everything you do or say, it's the town gossip in seconds. So when he left, it broke them all. But for Zayn, it was more because he was in love. He wanted to him to be his first everything, first kiss, first boyfriend, first real love. He just never thought he'd be his first heart break too. But through it all, all Zayn wants is for him to love Zayn back. Because Harry fucking Styles is just that intoxicating for Zayn and he'll fall, every single time.

    Summary
      The Red Thread of Fate also referred to as the Red Thread of Marriage, and other variants, is an East Asian belief originating from Chinese mythology. It is commonly thought of as an invisible red cord around the finger of those that are destined to meet one another in a certain situation as they are "their true love".The two people connected by the red thread are destined lovers, regardless of place, time, or circumstances. This magical cord may stretch or tangle, but never break.Harry and Louis meet eachother when Louis moves to Cheshire and becomes Harry's new neighbor. This is their story.

    Summary
      Louis fell apart when her ex broke up with her and moved across the country. Just as she’s starting to move on, Zayn comes back to town for their mutual friends’ wedding – with a new girlfriend as her plus one. Blindsided and scrambling to save face, Louis lets herself get talked into a fake relationship with her new friend Harry. Their arrangement makes Louis feel pathetic and embarrassed, but it’s only going to last a few weeks. She just has to get through the wedding – what could happen?
