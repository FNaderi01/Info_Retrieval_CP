    Summary
      A crazy gift from a father to a daughter is just that, crazy. With college and life weighing on your shoulders, the last thing you want is one more thing to stress about. But with your best friend pushing your back, the once empty building bustles to life, drawing in all kinds of personalities and faces, opening doors once nonexistent and spinning colors you didn't know could mix. Life can be hectic, but sitting down and sharing some coffee and cream with friends can be the sweetest highlight in the story called life.
