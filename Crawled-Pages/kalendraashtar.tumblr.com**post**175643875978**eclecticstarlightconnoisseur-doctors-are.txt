                            eclecticstarlightconnoisseur:“Doctors are trained to deal with loss; grief becomes a second lover, only supplanted by life. They become masters at it until they truly fool themselves by thinking they are immune. But not every loss is the same, as no two people are equivalent. Sometimes you invest beyond the line, care a little too much, let them under your skin until there is no skin at all to protect you.” – @kalendraashtar​I  cry everytime I read this.  I know this feeling and pain so well as I have spent  30 years working in various ICUs as a critical care nurse and another 10 as a nurse practitioner. I can touch someone and feel their body’s brokenness.  I can touch someone and know if today will be their last. It is a heavy weight to carry sometimes, but it is mine. I am a healer. This is what I am and what I do. Thank you Kalendraashtar for so succinctly putting into words describing this aspect of our professional life.Heart too full for words. Thank you for everything you are and everything you do. ❤️🙌
