    Summary
      ''It took this group of royals and friends less than ten minutes to surprise me. They weren't Yusuf Al-Kaysani, Prince of Tunisia, Princess Andromache 'the Scythian', Prince Nicolò [...] anymore: suddenly I was speaking to Andy and her wife Quynh, to 'Booker' and Lykon, to Nile, and to the couple that made the world fall in love with the idea of love all over again, Nicky and Joe. [...] When asked about his feelings about the upcoming royal wedding, which promises to be the event of the year, Nicolò admitted, with a candid sincerity that is so often lacking in that environment: 'To be quite honest, I am just glad to be able to marry Yusuf, the love of my life, with our families and closest friends. It is more than I probably deserve. Everything else is secondary.' [...]'' - from the article by James Copley, 'Maybe the world still needs royals: how the new generation is changing the game', published on the New York Times in May, 20**

    Summary
      “Don’t you recognize us?” the large man asks him, a frown on his face. “Well, we do all look very different than we did two decades ago,” the man in the hoodie rolls his eyes. “Of course he’s not going to recognize us.” The others ignore him, which Klaus thinks is quite rude, but he’s not going to say as much and risk getting stabbed. “Klaus, it’s me,” the leather guy repeats. “Diego. Your brother.”Klaus’ eyes bug out of his skull—that’s the craziest thing he’s heard all year. or, AU where Klaus runs away from home when he's ten-years-old—just a few months later, his fully grown siblings fall out of a portal in the sky.

    Summary
      Klaus Hargreeves decides not only to stay in 1968, but to adopt his younger self (and Vanya) creating an alternate timeline. Everything is fine and dandy until the siblings he left behind show up in that timeline's 2019 and it turns out they have a week to fix the mess before everything gets lost.  Maybe two heads are better than one, but that would require those heads to work together on an issue for more than a few moments. At least they have an extra Five.
