    Summary
      Never in a million years would he have ever considered casting her in one of his projects. Kids who work on teen shows are usually destined for a life of barely-better-than-a-soap-opera primetime shit. Maybe she could stretch herself and get a spot on something better, but there’s no way she has the chops for this. He’ll take the meeting, move on, and her agent can let her down gently. He doesn’t have to worry about that. Maybe that makes him an asshole, but no one’ll be surprised; he never said he wasn’t one.

    Summary
      But it was nice. 
Cassandra thought the whole thing was nice.
However, she didn’t tell Allie the guy down the street that she’d been spending almost all her time with was Harry. In fact, she didn’t tell anyone the guy down the street was Harry. She figured he wouldn’t want her to say anything, so she didn’t. When the summer was over, she knew they’d both go back to their normal routine and life would continue as it always did. He would ignore her and she would pretend she didn’t like being friends. 
Or something.

    Summary
      Our story beggins only a day after Allie and Will were arrested, the same day the search party returned from the woods.Following the end of the first season, this is my headcanon of what would have happened if they had recorded the second season (we haven't lost hope yet, tho). Hence the name, Season 2 but it's actually better BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS. It's going to cover the events I believe could have been already written on the scripts THEY ALREADY HAD for Season 2 if Shitflix wasn't so full of shit.And also a lot of what we all craved *wink* *wink*.Yes, I'm talking Grizzam. AND SO MUCH MORE.Hopefully someone would like it.

    Summary
      And the thing with her and Harry has always been...complicated. Even before they ended up here. Because they’ve always liked each other, she thinks. Always flirted. Always had this forbidden little thing they liked to hide. She thinks she’s liked him since she was 15 and he grinned at her and called her cute on a school trip to the science centre.

      Il fallut six jours à Grizz pour trouver une terre cultivable, des animaux et du poisson.Il lui en fallut un de plus pour rejoindre New Ham, pouvoir enfin annoncer à toute la communauté qu'ils ne mourraient pas de faim l'hiver prochain.Et il lui fallut près de trois jours supplémentaire pour enfin avoir le bonheur de poser à nouveau les mains sur la peau pâle de Sam Eliot.Et malgré la satisfaction et la félicité qui déferla dans ses veines, cela ne lui prit qu'une minute, soixante secondes tout au plus pour décider consciemment que sa vie s’achèverait dans la fureur et le sang.

    Summary
      Harry generally doesn’t know what the hell he’s doing. Hence, how he landed himself in some kind of time loop.But when Allie returns, carrying two shots of whiskey in highball glasses, he still laughs as he watches her shoot hers straight back, and thinks maybe this whole thing with her is a little separate from all that in the first place. Like, he can know what he’s doing with her while simultaneously knowing nothing about anything else.

    No Archive Warnings ApplyHarry Bingham/Allie PressmanHarry Bingham Allie PressmanAlternate Universe - Actors Friends With Benefits
    Summary
      She doesn’t like the flashing of the cameras — blinding even in the daylight — but she does like the way his hand always tightens in hers, as though she’s the one thing he can’t bear to be separated from. It’s just the two of them against the world. 
The paparazzi feel like their penance, the price they have to pay to spend the day together. Always the night, too — not a sign of their fragile willpower, but something more akin to predestination. Allie’s addiction to him is only exacerbated with every touch. When she goes home, she tries not to look, but she can’t help it. The photos of them are always so easy to find, accompanying so-called news articles speculating on either forever or disaster, never in between.
All she can think is that she likes the way the two of them look together.

    Summary
      As she’s brushing her teeth, she gets another email from Harry Bingham. He’s sent her back the intake form and said he hopes she decides to work with Sloan, and to be in touch if she has any other questions or needs more information from him. She marks the email unread so she can deal with it tomorrow. But she likes the name Sloan, and she likes how seriously he’s taking this. If he’ll agree to do Tuesdays and Saturdays, she’ll definitely teach this kid.
