    Summary
      Heyo! October is finally here and I'm here to participate in the Kinktober writing challenge. These will all be Bakugou ships because I legit can't ship any other characters. I hope you guys enjoy this wonderfully smutty work. Also, a quick note, I might forget some tags, so I'll be gradually adding them as I progress into more ships and kinks into this work.(Discontinued, but you can still read this as a one-shot book with a few Katsuki ships)

    Summary
      Katsuki Bakugou was next in line for the throne of Shizuoka, and he planned to rule his parents nation alone. Suddenly, he was being forced to hold his own Selection against his will in order to appease his parents and distract the citizens of their Kingdom from the impending war. The idea of romance both terrified and disgusted him, and he had no intention of looking for a partner within the group of 35 men and women who were coming to the palace to compete for his hand in marriage. But maybe, just maybe, love wasn't such a bad thing after all, and before he had even knew, he had fallen, and there was no way for him to pick himself back up again. All that was left for him to do. . . was choose.

    Summary
      A month before prom, Bakugou comes out to his class as gay and asks them if he can start over and grow to become closer to them and promises to turn over a new leaf  with some pretty good and very supportive results from everyone but all good things come to a end. When a certain bitter grape boy decides to use this against him and starts to spread around a rumor that could ruin Bakugou's future relationship status. After his plan becomes a success, Bakugou starts to get bullied by a group of 1-b girls. This completely tanks his confidence and raises his depression to the point where he starts to push everyone away from him again. After catching on to this, 1-A  decides to band together and becomes the boys protection squad to help build back up his confidence and show him the love and care he deserves. Bakugou appreciates the effort but he still feels out of place that is until a random student runs into him by accident activating their quirk. Bakugou just brushed off the incident until the class all return to the dorms at the end of the day only to see..... A bunch of Bakugou's roaming the common room.

    Summary
      Às vezes Bakugou se perguntava como conseguiu se apaixonar por uma pessoa completamente idiota e irritante como Monoma Neito. Não que o próprio não possuísse uma personalidade terrível, mas era quase como desejar viver em pé de guerrear pelas menores coisas. Inclusive, era exatamente nessa situação em que se encontrava.
