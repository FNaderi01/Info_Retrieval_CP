    Summary
      Harry knew his magic could apparate him, but not quite so far. So when he ends up in the office of Eric Northman in Shreveport, Louisiana to say he was surprised is an understatement. When he feels drawn to the vampire he is even more surprised. Then again, maybe he shouldn't be, because if anything unexpected would happen, it would be to him.

      Gwrtheyrn of the Cornovii was born on the Summer Solstice of Five-Hundred Thirty anno domini, the calendar system that the Romans had brought to his homeland along with their legions.  He also was bound with the bloodline curse to be undying, cursed to watch his bloodline wither and wane over and over again throughout time.  Too bad he was too powerful to bind forever.  Just fifteen hundred years...give or take.A time-twisted not-even-close-to-HP-canon crossover with True Blood with hints and pieces of Southern Vampire Mysteries.SLASH and A/U

    Summary
      Starts in Harry's 5th year. Harry sends a desperate letter to the founders of Hogwarts. He begs them to come to Hogwarts and stop the corruptions that's festering inside the school. Godric gets the letter as he reaches the rooftop and chooses to help save the school before he greets the sun. He has lived for over two thousand years without his mate and no longer wishes to continue his existence alone. Right now it is going to be Harry/Eric and Neville/Godric pairing but we will see where it goes. I have adopted this work from Lirial89 with their permission.
