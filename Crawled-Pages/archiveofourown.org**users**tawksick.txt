    Summary
      They didn’t know how it happened, or when a concept so fickle and ridiculous blossomed in the garden of doubts, anger, and pain in which they so frequently visited. Between scarred hands and bloodied knuckles, unspoken thoughts stirred like petals in springtime rain. Bakugo was not prepared for the undeniable change spurring between them. Unfortunately, neither was Midoriya.

      Hinata finds that he likes standing close to Kageyama on buses and trains. It doesn't mean anything--probably. Maybe.

    Summary
      Deku has been maddeningly rocking onto the back two legs of his chair over and over, so it was only a matter of time before he went flying backwards. Lucky for him, Katsuki not only anticipated this, but is able to knock Deku back into place before he can smash his stupidly busy brain all over the floor. “Oh, gosh! Thanks, Kacchan!” Deku says, his round face turned towards Katsuki.“Sit still, I’m not catching you again,” he growls, a little irritated by the fact that he hadn’t actually made a conscious decision to catch him this time. --Katsuki has a strange tendency to act without thinking when it comes to Deku.

    No Archive Warnings ApplySirius Black/Remus LupinRemus Lupin Sirius BlackPost-Azkaban technically fluff if you ignore the fact that they both tragically die later
    Summary
      Sirius tests Remus one day to ensure he's not secretly a Death Eater in disguise. He gets a little carried away.
“Ha ha! That proves it! The real Remus Lupin would know that my first love has always been one Minerva McGonagall.”
