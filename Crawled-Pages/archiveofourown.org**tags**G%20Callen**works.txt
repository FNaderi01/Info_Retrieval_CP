    Summary
      You’d think, after working ten years with a guy who never shuts up, there’d be nothing left to learn. Steve certainly claimed to know everything. Then Danny goes and does something crazy like adopt thirteen children and a deformed sea turtle. Not to mention the ‘quest of lies’ Charlie incident.  A glimpse into recovery, domestic life, trust issues, and bread making for Steve and Danny.

    Summary
      Conversation is a game of circles. – Ralph Waldo Emerson
In every episode of NCIS:LA, there is an unseen moment, a hidden exchange between a spymaster and her finest student. As handler and agent, or protector and orphan, or, sometimes, defenders of one another even when the other would *really rather they not, thanks,* Hetty and Callen have a relationship worth uncovering. Updated weekly, tag for every single episode of season 6.
