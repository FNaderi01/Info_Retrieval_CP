this is dumb but likebig autism and adhd tip tbhbut get some offline hobbies. learn to bake. learn to knit or crochet. play with clay, paint pictures, commit to a garden, get really good at grilling i dont care just do something with your hands. do something that MAKES something.it satisfies the part of your brain that feels so empty and never settled. it feels REAL and tangible and productive. we are so wired to DO things and tech draws us in for that reason, but there is nothing as satisfying as making something physical and seperate.

they fought an akuma for 5 hours and then, before they zipped away like usual, they made the mistake of sitting down, for just 1 second, just for a quick rest, just…. just for a little bit…….

okay so i just need to talk again about why this is so important to methere is not a single cut. there was not a moment of hesitation that was cut out where ethan was like “uh what do i do” he just immediately went from pouring citric acid into his mouth to doing a song and dance.the eye contact. he looks mark right in the eyes. he doesn’t do this for us, it’s for mark, and it’s ridiculous. the perfect synchronization. what the fuck. how. why. what was this bit.

the worst is when i make myself show up but i can’t make myself act well enough. like i tell myself “just go to the party, you’ll feel better, you’ll have fun.” but i go and nothing changes. i just realize better how tired i am. how i’m not good with anyone. i tell myself: make a joke, smile, relax, stop being so serious. but my brain feels empty and everything is muted. i’m trying, i swear. it’s just that i don’t have the energy for this. i don’t have the energy for anything, i guess.

ah the idea that sparked the whole au in the first place, the teenage owl beastheadcanons? ideas for the au if you will:- luz has less magic than a typical witch due to problems with her magic bile sac, making it difficult for her to cast spells and keeps her reliant on glyphs. this also affects the progression of the owl curse as she has much less internal magic to fight off the permanent effects (eda takes somewhere around 20 years for her to go full owl beast mode while it takes luz only around 6 months)- as an owl beast, luz is more defensive than eda, being both smaller and younger. she gets poofy and swipes at people getting too close but doesn’t actively hunt down other creatures in her area. she could probably coexist with other beings in the same room as her with minimal confrontation. basically, think baby owls.- she’s lanky and a fluffball at the same time as juvenile birds tend to be. it’s fun to draw bird-based monsters ok brainrot over, have a good day
