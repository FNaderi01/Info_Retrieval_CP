BechtRBWS Online Software for Risk-Based Work Selection
Becht’s Risk Based Work Selection (BechtRBWS) is an online software platform designed to facilitate RBWS sessions for major turnarounds and plant shutdowns. Average improvement in work-scope is 24% with a typical savings of $3,000,000 per event over Becht’s last 20 facilitated sessions.
