In a struggle for independence and freedom you face off against japans most popular hero, who is not above using threats, blackmail and intrigue to win back what he perceives as his right or end your career as a hero.Only few dare to stand up with you, first of all  your loyal friend Kirishima. To your surprise his best friend, another temperamental blonde seems to have taken an interest in your story as well.

    Summary
      Izuku wandered around the spaceship after cleaning himself up. He had put on a soft, earthy green sweater that went off both freckled shoulders. A black skirt swished around his body, stopping above his knees. Knee high socks and his favorite red sneakers completed the look.No one would ever suspect that a soft, sweet looking boy like him would be a murder.

    Summary
      "Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned."Just how many times does Shoto Todoroki have to say those same words all over again...It's fairly well-known that priests have rules they can't break. He cannot marry. He cannot engage in sexual acts. He cannot abandon his flock. Beyond everything, he cannot forsake his God.All these years, Shoto, a priest, has never been terrible at obeying rules that is until Katsuki Bakugo, a criminal gang leader, who visits his church one particular night appears in his life. There are angels and demons at war in his head. He wants to stay true to his vows but it is only becoming impossible when Katsuki seeks vengeance for the unintentional offensive thing he has said and now the latter is going to show him that even priests aren't as pure as people think.The story revolving around one who follows rules and encounters who breaks them, just what could possibly go wrong? A lot. Change. Intimacy. Love. Something much deeper than that. Perhaps until Shoto struggles to resist against temptation and breaks his vow of celibacy in the altar of his own church and oh, dear Lord, he would do it again.For the sin he has committed;This is his confession.

    Summary
      Bakugou accidentally drinks a truth serum. He seems to be normal until Iida walks in and the blonde shouts out how hot he looks. The blue haired boy is flustered which only causes Bakugou to continue. It’s not like he doesn’t like Bakugou, he just doesn’t want to take advantage of Bakugou’s truthful state. Will everything go back to normal? Or will Iida confess to Bakugou after the serum has worn off?

Enjoy everyone smut in second chapter
    Summary
      Katsuki doesn't know why they ended up here, all of them scattered on the floor in varying stages of intoxication. It started as harmless nostalgia of how stubborn and ridiculous he used to be, because he totally isn't now, thank you very much. The topic of Katsuki in makeup led to the question of what he would look like now with a full face of it. Kaminari had snorted and said he wouldn't do it, and Sero and Kirishima had laughed at Katsuki's loud exclamation that he would, in fact, do it, and Mina had smiled in delight and bounced to her bedroom to gather more makeup than Katsuki had ever seen in his life. It was then that he realized maybe Kaminari wasn't a complete moron, and that maybe Katsuki would always take every little challenge too seriously. Whatever.---Or, Bakugou acts cocky and childish, Kirishima is done and ready to knock him down a peg, and years of tension finally snaps.

      He glanced at him, but couldn’t physically find what he was looking for. Just that backlit figure with blonde hair. He sighed and accepted his help, standing up. He found himself in front of a very less blurred Kacchan’s face.“Ah.”“Mh?”“So your puberty didn’t suck as much as mine.”“...What?”  OrSome kids break Izuku's eyeglasses while playing in the park and Katsuki helps him.

    Summary
      “A-ah I’m sorry! I don’t mean to laugh!” the guy said quickly, raising a hand in surrender while his other that was covering his mouth slowly lowered, revealing a sweet shark-toothed grin. And, shit. Katsuki should never have looked around. No, he should’ve stayed sat there, should’ve kept his eyes closed because holy hell.This was the cutest boy he’d probably ever seen.He had twinkling red eyes - God those were pretty eyes - a soft round face and pointy teeth that shouldn’t make him sweeter, but somehow…fuck, everything about this guy was cute, that downy dark hair, his stocky stature, his weird clothes-Lord, Katsuki knew he was gay but that had literally only been limited to fictional characters until now and so how was he supposed to prepare himself for a real life experience in the middle of an ENTRANCE EXAM what the FUCK— - or, the two meet at a high school entrance exam, and Katsuki thinks he might have genuinely had a love at first sight experience at fucking fifteen if that cute shark-toothed guy over there has anything to say about it.
