    Summary
      In the wake of his escape from the Hunger Games and the death of his husband, Davey Jacobs is forced once again into the spotlight as the public face of Union, the rebellion against the corrupt and oppressive Capitol. The resistance force is pushing forward with their work now that they've been thrust into the open, but President Pulitzer is escalating matters as well in his attempt to quash the growing revolution. Davey, still struggling with the traumas of his past, watches as everything of his old life starts to slip away, and he throws himself into the only real purpose he has left: Union. Then Davey's world is changed by a single broadcast, a message from the president with an unexpected surprise. Now Davey has all the more reason to fight, and he will not rest until Pulitzer's regime is brought down, once and for all.

      Michael Heere has a decently bad life. Awful father, awful experience at school, and awful social skills. All he has going for him are his best friend, Jeremy Mell, and his mom. That is until he finds out about this thing called a SQUIP. A computer that could solve his problems, and could get him with his crush, nothing could go wrong!

    Summary
      Severus Snape gazed at the orange and yellow hues of the crackling fire in front of him, eyes unfocused and distant. Lucius sat beside him on the couch, an arm around the man he considered to be family. Both had tired faces, with red-rimmed eyes from tears. In a chair across the room, Narcissa cried too, holding tightly to her own son, young Draco, who was upset at his mother’s tears, trying to comfort her with a small hand on her cheek and head tucked tightly at her shoulder. The day had been a terrible one, the destruction of everything he loved. His son, Alexei, had been taken from him, stolen from his bed, only weeks before he was due to begin Hogwarts. The only remainder of his darling Katarina, his wife and mate, who had been murdered many years before, when Alexei was only an infant, gone. His only consolation was that he himself remained alive, as his mate was dead, he only lived for his child, so if Alexei died, so too would Severus.

      Katarina never thought she could be so happy! She is finally free of having to fear her doom flags, and what's more, no one thinks she is a villainess! For the first time, she can start to enjoy life as a (relatively) normal girl in another world! It's the final semester at the Academy, and she's going to make the most of it!However, Prince Geordo must enlist the help of Katarina's friends when he discovers an ancient secret suggesting Katarina may not be quite as free from her destruction end as she thinks....Alternatively, a story where Katarina isn't worried about her doom flags, but everyone else is.Sequel to Mirror, Mirror, although it can (mostly) be read as a standalone.

    Summary
      Agent Michael [REDACTED], a government agent who's main job is to cover up the numerous lawsuits and OSHA violations charged against Black Mesa. After a severe brush with cancer as a result of his former employment with Aperture Science, he's hoping Black Mesa will be a walk in the park. He'll soon learn, however, that nothing is a walk in the park when it comes to Black Mesa versus the law.
Security Chief Calhoun, head of security at Black Mesa. He's rarely seen by anyone, much less the security team. He's considered by many to be the Administrator's right hand man--or his lapdog, to those who hate him. No one is sure of when he turned up; they've just assumed that he's always been at the job and they haven't noticed. He mans the surveillance room. If any kind of danger presented itself, Calhoun would be on the job in a heartbeat. Don't be fooled by those sleepy eyes--he's always watching.
And Gordon Freeman, an MIT graduate who often finds himself working as a heavy lifter for the science team. 
Three individuals--caught in one resonance cascade that will change them forever.
--A Barney/Gman Swap AU. This AU has a sideblog! Chapters posted on Saturdays and on Tumblr.

    Summary
      After the events of A Winter Soldier Comes to Claptrap, those remaining in the recently besieged junktown try to put their community, their relationships and their own minds back in order. Our heroes all deal with loss, love and shifting loyalties, none more so than the Winter Soldiers Buck and Red. Designed as government bioweapons to survive a nuclear winter that never came, both deal with the horror of the past in very different ways while trying to navigate the present. As if surviving the deadliest pandemic the world had ever known, climate change and war weren't enough, now the junktownies have to deal with a series of strange happenings - inexplicable mutations, strange dreams, mysterious lights and deaths with no seeming cause. When all is revealed, our heroes' chosen family will never be the same.
