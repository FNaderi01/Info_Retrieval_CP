Comerica Bank awards Brotherhood Crusade $100,000 to Support Youth Development Programs            
				By  Sentinel News Service                 
	                	                Published March 29, 2018

Comerica Bank recently awarded Brotherhood Crusade with a $100,000 grant donation to build on its relationship with the organization to support its youth development programs and its Youth Source Center. 
The Brotherhood Crusade Youth Source Center program increases educational and career-based mentoring opportunities by aligning youth with committed mentors, re-engaging youth in school, developing their vocational life and social skills, improving their academic skills, engaging youth in work experience volunteerism and internships, and eventually helping youth secure employment.  
        ADVERTISEMENT        
This year marks Brotherhood Crusade’s 50th anniversary of providing programs and services to the Los Angeles community. Donald A. Kincey, Comerica Bank Senior Vice President of CA Community Affairs &amp; Corporate Communications said, “Brotherhood Crusade’s longevity and positive impact in our various communities is noteworthy and can be attributed to its equal attention to social, economic as well as political considerations. There are 3 pillars that all successful nonprofits have in common: clear vision, leadership and a collaborative model that aligns what is important with what is actually being accomplished. So much so, that people and institutions who have repeatedly given support to Brotherhood Crusade over the years, did so regardless of the economy, because they believe in the organization.” 
The Comerica partnership will enable the organization to continue providing quality programs and services that provide resources, education, mentoring, training, access and support to a youth population that is at risk and underserved. 
Kincey said, “Comerica Bank is proud of our support for the Los Angeles Brotherhood Crusade because its management demonstrates a level of passion and commitment in trying to solve the issues that impact our youth, and the future of our communities, that we all should aspire to reach.” 
Charisse Bremond Weaver said, “This is an exciting year for Brotherhood Crusade. We are celebrating 50 years of service to the Los Angeles community which would not be possible without partners like Comerica Bank who understand the urgency of our mission. We are grateful for this partnership which will make a huge impact in the lives of the young people we serve.”
