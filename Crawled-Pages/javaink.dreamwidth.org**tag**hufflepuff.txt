i’m a prideful hufflepuff who doesn’t know how to hufflepuff or can’t bring herself to hufflepuff, and i am a hufflepuff because i value hard work and labor and fairness and damn justice, but i used to be a ravenclaw, as a kid i use to value knowledge over all but that came from deep arrogance, though then and now i value knowledge for knowledge, but it was more of a status thing for me back then, knowledge is power and cunning and being above others and also wisdom and a clear sight of the world and compassion, knowledge was a means to an end, and that end used to be worth in myself, it was a signal that i was worth something, knowledge is edge. but now i value hard work above that – i still value knowledge for knowledge but it’s more about communicating with others and understanding my world, and part of that is ravenclaw like, but hufflepuff overall, and i’m just a puff that can’t puff, ya know. i can’t bring myself to work, i value it, but the effort kills me though i’m in love with the idea. i have no drive, and it kills me.- i miss my friend. how do you fall out of friend-love? - also, i'm - i'm something. this paper i've been given an extension on, and my lovely teacher prophesied that i needed an extension, but my pride was like "probably, but let's try for the deadline" and on the deadline i emailed him saying "please, i need that extension" and now here i am a day later and still a mess. i have been blessed with my teachers. an all-nighter tonight to get this first draft COMPLETELY done and to get other homework done.
