    Summary
      A little story about how life keeps beating Hawke to the ground, and yet he still stands up again every time. And also about how you're never really alone, even in the worst moments.(My  rewrite of Here Lies the Abyss because I don't agree with bioware in this and because I think Hawke is too stubborn to just accept the fade rules.)

    Summary
      It was 1946, and Steve Rogers was dead, as dead as Barnes before him. But Angie—?  Angie Martinelli was still very much alive.Perhaps Peggy was queer, then. But queer or not, she'd be damned if she'd be a coward.

    Summary
      Peggy Carter walked into a bar.
Actually, she wasn’t quite sure that was entirely true. She must have walked in at some point, but she couldn’t recall opening the door and stepping inside. Somehow, she’d just arrived in this place.

    Summary
      Chloe glanced down at her watch quickly, wondering how long they had been standing there. She was tired and wrung out, emotionally and physically. She felt like she could sleep for a week.
“Just go,” Alek said, looking straight ahead, not even turning to Chloe.
His eyes were fixed straight ahead, on the man talking in front of them, on the small urn on the stand waiting to be interned. That was where you were supposed to be looking during a funeral.
