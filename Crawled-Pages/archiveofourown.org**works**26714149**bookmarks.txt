    Summary
      Kibo is the daughter of the infamous S-ranked villain, Taimuterā. She was trained to rule her father’s criminal organization, and become a villain greater than All For One. But when her mother is murdered, she snaps. Kibo escapes with her little brother, Shizuka, and calls the heroes. She is adopted by her martial arts teacher and best friend Yukiyama Jiko, and now she lives a semi-normal life. But Kibo still struggles with the pain of her past, and barely interacts with anyone outside of her family. When she enters U.A, she brings a fresh set of burdens and secrets that she carries alone, but how long will it be before she snaps?(Shenanigans, fluff and angst will ensue. Also, will update summary soon.)
