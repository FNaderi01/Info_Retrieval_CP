    Summary
      A week after the eventful night, a new member of the Argent family arrives in Beacon Hills. Scott and Allison are forced to continue their blossoming romance in secret. At the same time, Stiles is helping Derek to find Betas for Hale's pack to prevent the young Alpha go on feral. 
However, there's another chaos happening in Beacon Hills. Hunters declared wars to werewolves, a mysterious monster is killing innocents and newly bitten werewolves that aren't ready for the real horror in the supernatural world. 
Once again, it's up to sarcastic human Stiles, young new Alpha Derek, and a semi-trained stubborn werewolf Scott to stop the hunters and the monster at the same time in Beacon Hills.

    Summary
      Stiles was hurt much more from Gerard's beating and wrecking his jeep than he was letting on. But it's okay because he knows a bite will make it all better. Things are far more broken than he knows though and a bite can't fix everything.

    Summary
      Peter bites Stiles against his will after he tracks Derek. An ADHD Werewolf is already a problem, but one with blue eyes is a bigger one. Add on to that his Mother's secrets coming to light, and Stiles is going to have a hell of a time just trying to graduate on time.
