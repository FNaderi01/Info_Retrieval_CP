		Hendrick Health System, located in Abilene, Texas, is a not-for-profit healthcare provider affiliated with the Baptist General Convention of Texas  serving a 22-county region in the Texas Midwest.
Hendrick was the first hospital to permanently serve the Texas Midwest when it opened in 1924, and today, it provides a comprehensive range of healthcare services, including a medical center licensed for 564 beds.[1]
More than 3,000 employees make up the Hendrick team.[1] In 2007, Hendrick was one of only 12 organizations worldwide honored with the Gallup Great Workplace Award, which honors Hendrick as one of the most engaged and productive workforces in the world.[2] Hendrick has since earned the Gallup Great Workplace Award every subsequent year.
Hendrick also has received the Pathway to Excellence designation from the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC).[3] The designation recognizes Hendrick as creating a work environment where nurses can flourish and identifies it as one of the best places to work.

History[edit]
Hendrick Medical Center, originally West Texas Baptist Sanitarium, opened on September 15, 1924. The original facility had five floors, seventy-five beds, fireproof construction, steam heat, hot and cold running water in every room and three elevators.[4] The hospital was the result of the vision of Millard A. Jenkins, pastor of the First Baptist Church of Abilene. When a proposition to build a countywide hospital in Taylor County was voted down in 1921, Jenkins gathered a group of Abilene community members to help take on the dream of building a hospital.[5] A sprawling 6-acre (24,000 m2) field on the outskirts of north Abilene was donated by Clifton M. Caldwell and his wife as a location for the hospital.[5]
In the early 1930, the Great Depression put the hospital in financial trouble. The depression increased the need for charity care, while churches were too feeble to support the hospital. To help keep its doors open, the hospital accepted chickens, goats and black-eyed peas as payment for service.[6] In 1936, the hospital was saved from bankruptcy by West Texas ranchers Mr. and Mrs. T. G. Hendrick. They paid off the mortgage and gave additional money for the construction of a new wing. In recognition of their generosity, the hospital was renamed in honor of the Hendricks.[5]
