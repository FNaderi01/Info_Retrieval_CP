    Summary
      One choice, one action. For every one choice made another made an different one. So many timelines and variables. It's an consistent flow of what could have been, what can be, and should have happened. For every action there is an reaction... what if you choice differently? The world was not as bright as you thought it was. They sheltered you, they cared for you, and they loved you. You were in a world far more dangerous than you would ever know. There was a reason they ran and you were about to find out why.(Please read Our Journey before reading)Empress appears in Chapter 4

    Summary
      The Empress of the Alternian Empire has extended an invitation to Earth, and humanity is going to answer it. You, a former space captain and current freelance photographer, have somehow been persuaded to come along on a journey to Alternia with "Earth's finest". The rest of your crew is going to deal with the peace talks and negotiations by themselves; you are very tired of being in the spotlight, and the last time you were in charge ended in catastrophe. As the crew's photographer, your job is supposed to be documentation from the sidelines. That's it.The only problem is that dark and mysterious forces in the Furthest Ring are messing with your life. Trouble in the form of annoying trolls won't leave you alone. A fiery temper and an ingrained sense of curiosity isn't helping your case, either.[Rewrite of Foreign Dignitaries]

    Summary
      The thing about the Multiverse Theory is that it leaves a spacious seat for Murphy’s Law to sit its ass down and completely wreck everyone’s individual shits. So when Dave and Dirk find a webcomic called Homestuck, the least surprising thing that occurs is their lives taking an instant downward spiral. All Dave wanted to do was draw his subjectively amazing comic and survive at the bare minimum, but really, who can blame him for anything that happens afterward.ORIn which the main protagonist discovers a comic about himself and righteously flips the fuck out causing a chain of events that leads to the end of the universe as we know it, meeting some zany characters along the way and playing a game with his friends.

But one morning, you wake to find that your bathroom mirror has a note written on it by a ghost and it changed the course of your life forever. This is the story of how you got wrapped up in someone else's threads of fate and changed their life forever too. 
It's only fair that you fix the problems you've caused him, isn't it?

    Summary
      "Your name is John Egbert, and you are going to flip your monumental shit if one more thing in your life changes."After a failed invasion in 1592, The Empress cut her losses and left all trolls who had fought in the Earth Wards for dead, not realizing that it was about 95% of her population. Troll and human society slowly merged, but stayed separated, with different stores, towns, schools, everything. But after a new law passed encouraging the mesh of troll and human society, one small town just outside of Seattle would be the first of its kind to host a troll and human highschool in the evenings.

    Summary
  She'd done it. She'd 'won.' But for Dolorosa it remained a hollow victory.
  Terra remained a strange world filled with unpleasant surprises, some as alien as the human who'd stuck beside her. Others terribly familiar with a sting that no xenos creature could hope to rival. The road doesn't really end.

Where was he? Who was he? Was this even real? He looked around, looking for something that stood out. He spotted a memory, brighter and clearer than the other memories in the distance. He awkwardly started to swim towards it. Progress was slow but steady. Suddenly, a memory winked out of existence. Shocked, he looked around to find that all the other memories were dissapring, too. Some simply disappearing while other slowly dissolved into the void. Panicked, he redoubled his effort, desperately trying to reach the fading orb. He had to reach it before it disappeared forever! He was so close; it was just of reach! He lunged for it, but it still remained just out of reach! No! It was so close! He had to reach it! The golden memory was almost nonexistent now!
