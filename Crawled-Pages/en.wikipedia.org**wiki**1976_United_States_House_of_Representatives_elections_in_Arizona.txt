The 1976 United States House of Representatives elections was an election for the United States House of Representatives in 1976 which coincided with Jimmy Carter's election as president. Carter's narrow victory over Gerald Ford had limited coattails, and his Democratic Party gained a net of only one seat from the Republican Party in the House. This election is notable for being the last time any party had a veto-proof majority in the House.
