    Summary
      Reggie’s sister, Rachel, was twelve when he, Luke, and Alex died. Five years later she died too at seventeen. A young singer/dancer who had no idea how to deal with the ghostly world was perfect prey for Caleb Covington. 
This is an AU where Caleb winds up getting the boy’s souls, they meet Rachel at the club and this is the story of them trying to free themselves and Rachel and get back to Julie.

    Summary
      The decision to go on a road trip was spontaneous, as most of Reggie’s ideas tended to be, but made sense when the three actually thought it out._____“A road trip.”
“A what?”
“We should go on a road trip!”

    Summary
      Julie and the band have started to find a kind of normal, now that they're free of Caleb's stamp. Naturally, this couldn't last.Julie wakes up one morning to find that Reggie is suddenly the only ghost in her band, and nobody but Julie and Reggie even remembers seeing Alex and Luke perform with them. At first, they think it's just a matter of getting the guys back or breaking some kind of spell - they beat Caleb, so they can do this too.The more they search for answers, though, the less they like them.
