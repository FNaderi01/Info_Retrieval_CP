The room was filled with your moans and his low grunts. His sculpted face was shimmering under the cheap orange hue of the motel room light with the beads of his sweat. You could almost imagine the state that you were probably in, with your pink lips swollen, pupils dilated and your hair a tangled mess.“You know,” he said, gripping your waist and increasing his pace, “I don’t usually do this.” The sudden change in momentum elicited a moan from your mouth.“What?” you managed to breathe out, “Sex?”“Sex with strangers.” He said, correcting you. Your nails dug into his skin as you reached up to suck on the soft flesh just above his collar bone. Keep reading

The words on his book silhouetted as bright headlights
passed over the wide windowpane glossing over the dimly lit room. The
comforting whirling oscillation of the heater and the hesitant rain trickling
outside became background as he zoned into the sound of a running engine. He
sighed marking his page with the ribbon bookmark, then closed the book with a
clap; it was just getting to the good part. Harsh and rapid knocking drummed at
the door before he even had time to stretch his limbs. He yelled from his
recliner setting his circle glasses and book down on the side table, “I’m
coming, I’m coming!”He rubbed his palms over his tired eyes before he bent down
slightly with one eye shut to look through the peephole revealing the restless,
tall figure pacing on the other side. The figure raised his hand again, ready
to knock another radical pattern, “Jin, please open up!” Jin swung open one of
the wooden, double doors to open to the drenched cadet. The glossy, doe look in
the buck’s eyes barely peeked from under his shagging brown hair told him that,
in fact, everything wasn’t alright.  Keep reading

Luckily, you immediately regained your confidence.“Yes, because we both have to get ready and it’s going to take me forever to cover everything that’s currently on my neck.” you slapped his bicep and he just grinned, finally waking up. “Come on, we don’t have time.”“You should have told me to stop then so no point in complaining now.” you rolled your eyes at that, knowing he was right. His own eyes were watching your every move, lingering on your lips for a moment long enough that you thought he might kiss you again, but instead he leaned down and pressed a kiss to your collarbone, one of his arms leaving the pillow and traveling down to the bathrobe you were wearing, pulling it open just enough to expose the skin of your midriff, another kiss coming just a bit lower, to the valley of your breasts and you just sighed.“We don’t have time, Hobi…” you whined but let him be, a third kiss earning an involuntary content sigh from you, which brought a smile to his lips. He moved a little bit lower, reaching your stomach with another kiss just as you tangled your fingers in his hair.“Five more minutes. I have to punish you for calling me a brat.” he repeated the plea from earlier and added the last bit cheekily and with a sigh, you gave in, knowing there’s no point in arguing with him about it, your eyes closing just slightly when he pressed a final kiss before pushing the robe apart even more and laying his head down on your stomach, wrapping his arms around your middle and closing his eyes too to enjoy the silence.  Keep reading

The Boardroom (M)Pairing ⇥ Y/N works an uninspired job at a major marketing firm, and in the midst of your job applications, you found a different kind of job to entertain you or Executive!Jungkook x Assistant!reader Genre ⇥ Smut (Boardroom sex! Fingering, oral - male receiving, spanking, hint of sir kink, dirty talk, penetrative sex)Length ⇥ 5.3k_________________________________________________“Are you done whoring yourself out yet?”You huffed in annoyance, the lock of hair that had fallen between your eyes twitching before falling back into place. You couldn’t help but feel defeated as you glanced between the clock and the blinking cursor on the word document in front of you. Of course, Namjoon wasn’t helping matters. “I don’t think job applications are quite in the same league as ‘whoring’, Joon.” You muttered, grabbing your mouse to save the eighth unchanged copy of your resume.“You’re right, the difference is somebody actually wants what they’re getting.” You turned around to glare at the taunting voice, catching a glimpse of Namjoon as he lowered himself behind the cubicle wall with a snicker. You tossed a highlighter over the edge of it and smiled when you heard a soft 'ow!“."Seriously, Y/N, it’s 4:30, let’s go. Besides, if Seokjin catches you working on job applications at work again, you’ll actually need to whore yourself out to save your job.” “You’re repulsive, you know that.” But he was right. You’d been sending out job applications for months, with nary an interview to show for your efforts. It was a tiring process, and you’d already gotten your head bitten off more than once by Seokjin for it.Unlike previously thought, being an assistant at a high scale marketing company wasn’t all that glamorous or satisfying, but you’d been lured in by the decent pay check and brimming downtown core just steps away from your building. You’d yet to actually enjoy any of the sights downtown, but that was just how workaday life went. It wasn’t that you didn’t like your job, it was just wildly… okay. Your duties consisted of administrative work and replenishing refreshments at meetings, both of which a monkey could do, which Namjoon never failed to remind you.He was the only shining light of this place, and the only reason you hadn’t dumped Seokjin’s entire inkwell that he insisted on using right on the front of his Armani suits. Handsome he was, but not a very understanding boss. Hence, you were throwing yourself out into the job market once again. The real annoyance was when you found a job you really wanted, got attached, and heard nothing back. Unfortunately, that was the case once again. It was more of an established position than the one you had, albeit similar to your current one, but it gave more responsibilities and it paid better. The issue was, this was one of the most famous law firms in the country, Jung &amp; Jeon. There was no way they’d even look at your shoddy resume, the contents of which could fit on a post-it note.Namjoon appeared at your elbow, peering over your shoulder at the resume in front of you. It looked woefully empty. “You spelled proficient wrong.” “You know what!” You snapped, fighting back the smile at Namjoon’s laughter and the uselessness of the situation. You closed the document and shut down your computer, much to Joon’s pleasure. “Come on, Y/N, it’s not so bad being the sexy little assistant.” He slung an arm around you as you picked up your purse, your arm coming around his waist naturally. “Easy for you to say, you’re an accountant and you looove numbers. You don’t have to strut around in meetings asking if someone wants more coffee. Their hands don’t always just wander to the pastries, you know.” You grumbled, wrapping your scarf around your neck tightly. Namjoon’s arm tightened around you and spun you to face him. “Wait, seriously? Y/N, if that’s happening-”“No, Joon, I’m just being dramatic.” You saw the relief in his eyes, and you could kiss him for it. The best adopted work brother you could have. “I assure you, I can take care of myself.” You glared at his arm playfully, and Joon slid it off immediately, widening his eyes in mock fear. “Yes ma'am. Now, sushi!” You’d spent the rest of the evening trying to digest what felt like 30 dynamite rolls in your stomach, and working on your resume for the law firm. It wasn’t looking good. Jung Hoseok and Jeon Jungkook were elitists, only the finest grads ended up at their firm. Your marks weren’t bad by any means, but it wasn’t enough when the only other experience you touted on your resume was a waitressing job for a couple of summers. Really, you should be thankful for the job you had now, but you just… weren’t. You needed a challenge. With a big sigh, you submitted your resume without another thought, figuring that if it was meant to be, it would be. Besides, you had a big meeting to take care of tomorrow, filled with executives, and you had to get in early to make sure the coffee and catering was ready. Usually the meetings were smaller, around 5-8 people, but this one was so large you hadn’t even finished reading the guest list. You’d need to look nice. You rolled your eyes at yourself. You really were just a waitress in a pencil skirt. The morning started relatively smoothly, you’d gotten in before Namjoon, and even before Seokjin, who was a stickler for punctuality, so that was something. Maybe he’ll remember to put it on my reference letter, you snorted to yourself as you began brewing the coffee. Images of a huge board room filled with dusty old executives made you dread the day ahead. Couldn’t they get their own coffee? But no, Seokjin would be sitting in on the meeting and he preferred it when the company made efforts to make each guest feel tended to. “Like it’s a fucking hotel.” You whispered, popping your earbuds in and grabbing the tray. Turning the sound off on your phone, you wanted no interruptions as you stacked glasses, cutlery, and tongs onto a tray, silently mouthing the lyrics to the song blasting in your ears. Wheeling the utensils on a cart into the boardroom, you set up what you could before the catering came in, and returned to your desk to await the delivery. “Y/N!” You jumped three feet out of your seat as you hurriedly pulled your headphones out of your ears, your brain taking a second to pray that it was just Namjoon scaring you with his Seokjin impression again. It wasn’t. You peered up at the annoyed face of your boss and tried to stash your headphones away into a fist, though there was no point. He’d clearly seen them. “Yes, sir.” “I trust you’re using that phone of yours for things other than entertainment at work. Do you have the name tags ready?”“Uh- yes. Right here.” You patted a stack of pin-on name tags, alphabetically organized and ready to go. You looked back at him when you felt his heavy gaze still on you. “Wonderful. Where are the rest?” “The rest?” “Yah, Y/N…” Seokjin pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed deeply. “Yes. The rest of the last-minute RSVPs I just emailed you this morning to take care of. Try checking your email for a change, it’s the one thing I actually pay you to do. The executives are going to be here any minute and now half of them will not have name tags. How do you think that makes me look?” You suddenly felt like you were an inch tall. It was your fault, sure, but it was bad enough getting reprimanded, never mind getting yelled at for something as stupid as this. You could feel the tension throughout the few cubicles around you. Even Namjoon’s eyes were trained on his computer as though there were naked girls flashing on the screen. Traitor. “Sir, it’ll just take me a second-”“Don’t bother. They’re beginning to arrive. Just throw those ones out. We’ll have to make do, won’t we?” Seokjin huffed, fixing his tie as he stepped towards the reception area, where the pretty receptionist was standing, waiting to hand off the guests to Seokjin. He greeted them warmly like old friends, and you could almost glimpse a shred of humanity in the man. Too bad that humanity was going to disappear the second you were going to get fired. You groaned quietly and sunk deeper into your chair. The sound of plastic wheels moving and a pause made you look up against the back of your chair, where Namjoon was peering down at you from the edge of the cubicle wall. “That was rough. Why didn’t you see the email?” You silently pulled your phone out of your pocket, held it up, and turned the sound back on. The past notifications gleamed on your screen mockingly. “Ouch. You better make some damn good coffee today.” You smirked just to stop yourself from crying. It was lucky that the finance department was so close to Seokjin’s office, otherwise you would’ve never ended up by Namjoon. “Come on, pound it. Go get 'em tiger.” Namjoon held up his fist and you weakly pressed your own against it, groaning as you slid from your chair into a standing position. Time to go to work. Once the catering arrived, it was relatively simple from there on out. Plates of fresh fruit, muffins, and yogurts donned a nearby side table, as well as several coffee carafes. The executives trickled in slowly, helping themselves to their first cups and a few treats. You stood by the side until the meeting was meant to begin to make sure everybody had everything. Seokjin didn’t spare you a single glance, whereas he’d usually be at least giving you silent orders. He must really be pissed off. Pressing your back against the wall, you watched the men in their suits greet each other, shake hands, and discuss past meetings and future meetings. How very dull. The turnout was indeed higher than usual, and with so many unfamiliar faces and zero name tags, you prayed that nobody would ask you for details about Seokjin’s calendar. It was impossible to tell through his natural charisma and acting abilities, but your boss had feuds with nearly half the attendees. You’d innocently scheduled a lunch with one man, Jae, Seokjin’s apparent graduate school rival on your first week there, and you’d gotten your ass handed to you with a bow on top. Overall, you felt extremely unsettled as of late, and this meeting was doing nothing to calm your nerves. Resting your head against the wall, your eyes traveled to the doors on the other side, when something caught your eye. Among the well-dressed men and women in the boardroom, in walked a younger man, still a head taller than you, with smooth creamy skin, and large doe eyes. His black hair fell in his eyes as he walked in, but it looked clean and purposefully messy. Like he’d just gotten out of bed. He slipped into the crowd seamlessly, and you had to avoid tilting your head obviously to keep your eyes on him. His figure was lithe but muscular in a crisp black suit and black tie, and his biceps flashed for the brief moment when he shook somebody’s hand, revealing a cute smile. What was he doing here? A little young to be an executive, for certain. Damn, if only you had those name tags, you’d know who he was. You were too far from the crowds to hear him introduce himself, and it seemed that despite his young face, he was more well-known than you thought as many greeted him casually. This meeting just got a lot more interesting. “Don’t just stand there, offer some coffee.” You heard a hiss in your ear. Well, at least Seokjin was talking to you again, even if it was just to bark orders. You nodded and grabbed a carafe and a tray of glasses, offering coffee to those who stood without it. Consciously or subconsciously, you began to make your way towards the group where the black-haired man stood. He, two other men, and a woman were chatting quietly about a new deal involving the company. You were barely listening as you sidled up, silently offering the beverage until they paused long enough to look at you. Even then, they turned, took a cup, and held it out for you to pour. As you did so, you could feel the man’s eyes on you. You glanced up at him, and he smirked. His features were soft with a kind of graceful beauty, but his eyes were pitch black, and his jaw was sharp as a muscle worked within it. “Yes, thank you.” You poured the coffee carefully, careful not to let your hand shake as the cup filled with steaming liquid. You hadn’t even noticed him get closer to you. “Maybe you can offer me something sweet later as well.” He murmured, and the sound of his low honeyed voice shot straight to your core. You looked at his companions, but they were too immersed in their conversation to hear. You blinked owlishly but managed to offer a small smile as you twirled away with the carafe, feeling a tingle in your chest. The carafes eventually emptied, so you set on replenishing them in the boardroom kitchen. As the fresh coffee brewed, the executives trickled into the boardroom once again, so you were free to roam back to your desk for a few minutes. “Joon.”He grunted questioningly. “Joonie.”He grunted more insistently. “Joon-AH.” Namjoon slipped his glasses off abruptly and looked up at you, elbows placed on the edge of the cubicle wall, and chin resting on folded hands. His irritation could only be amusing to you right now. “Yes, my love. Did the coffee maker break again? Did you plug it in this time?”“Shut up, listen. There’s someone cute in that meeting.” Namjoon snorted, picking up his glasses again and wiping them off with his shirt. His warm skin still looked healthy and glowing under the fluorescent lights, and his blonde hair looked soft as ever. He was a gorgeous man; too bad you knew too well how much of a dork he was. “How old is he? 40? 50? Come on, Y/N, have the coffee fumes gone to your head?” “I don’t know, maybe 24?”“Is he another assistant?” “Didn’t seem like it, he’s sitting with the rest of them.” “Really? Impressive. Well then, godspeed. But don’t do anything stupid, you hear? I don’t need you getting canned today, I have financial statements to do. Thanks for the ‘cuteness’ update though.” He rolled his eyes as he replaced his glasses. You settled back into your chair for a while to wait out their coffees. Once the carafes and water jugs were filled, you piled everything onto a cart and slowly wheeled it into the room. The lights were dimmed due to the powerpoint presentation one of the guests was giving, but the flickering lights of the slides still allowed you to see their faces, namely the black-haired man’s. Picking up one of the carafes, you trailed around and topped off people’s coffees, careful not to obscure their views. You glanced up at Seokjin warily but he was thankfully immersed in the presentation; that was when you bent beside the gorgeous man to pour him some more coffee. In the darkness, with him sitting near the back, he had the perfect opportunity, and he took it. You could feel his large warm hand slipping over the outside of your thigh, and your eyes flickered to his face. He remained calm, face a mask, but you saw amusement in his eyes. His hand was patient and trained as it slipped over your skin, but just as quickly as it appeared, the absence of it left a cold rush over your skin. You missed his touch already. His eyes flickered to yours only for a moment, just in time to see the smirk on your lips, which seemed to satisfy him. Unable to linger, you continued on to the other members at the table until your work was done, but the thrum in your chest only grew as you stepped out of the boardroom. Pressing your back against the door, you gripped the carafe to your chest and let out a sigh. You’d never done anything like this before, especially not so blatantly at work. And with an executive! For all you knew, he was luring you in just to offer you up as a sacrifice to Seokjin. Though, why would he do that? He seemed kinder than that; you couldn’t miss the way his eyes watched yours the first time to see if he’d overstepped his boundaries. But you hadn’t exactly been subtle either, staring at him all agog from across the room. A crash of glass and voices chattering broke your reverie, and you spun around to face the door to the boardroom just as it opened. "Please, go on without me. It was a stupid accident.” The black-haired man stood before you, coffee coloured spatter covering the front of his white dress shirt. You sighed almost sadly; it was ruined and he had looked so good in it. His eyes caught yours and you found yourselves smiling as he eased the door closed. “If you wouldn’t mind leading me to the kitchen, Y/N, where I could find some club soda.” You sputtered for a moment, then nodded and pointed in the correct direction. As he slipped into the threshold of the kitchen, you bit your lip, and placed the carafe aside. “What a shame. It’s such a nice shirt.” You murmured, keeping your tone light as you watched him open the fridge, then close it with a plunk.  He held the bottle of club soda in his hands, and tore off some paper towel. “I’m not too torn up about it.” Something in his voice told you he really wasn’t. Probably had hundreds of them in his closet. “I’m Jungkook.” He fumbled a bit with the paper towel, his attempt at saving his shirt only half-hearted. You grabbed some paper towel and began dabbing at his shirt gingerly. You could already see the outline of his toned chest through the wetness of the white material and you bit your lip to concentrate on the task at hand. “I’m Y/N, I’m Seokjin’s assistant.” “God, you’ve got to stop doing that.” You heard him groan. You released your bottom lip with a small smirk. As your eyes flickered to the coffee stain again, your gaze returned to his. “This was no accident.” You said knowingly.  Jungkook tossed the sodden papertowel aside and shrugged his broad shoulders. “I don’t drink coffee. Had to get your attention somehow.” “How gallant of you.” “Didn’t leave me much choice, did you? Parading around in that tight little skirt, biting your lip constantly. Do you have any idea how tempting you look, Y/N? Takes a stronger man than I to resist.” His eyes carried that same glint again, and you found yourself pressing your thighs together at his words. “God, even now. You’re already all worked up. Sensitive little thing, aren’t you?” Jungkook stalked towards you like a predator, leaving you to back up against the wall like the willing prey you were. “Keep talking like that.” You murmured, fingers darting forward to grasp at his black satin tie. Pressing a hand by the wall next to you, he lowered his mouth to yours and kissed you intensely. Your body instantly reacted; a flood of warmth filled your stomach as your fingers reached up to tangle themselves in his hair. He pressed his hard, lean body into you, his thigh separating yours easily. “So needy, aren’t you?” He grunted softly, and you whimpered against his mouth. “When was the last time you were properly fucked, Y/N? Tell me.” You couldn’t breathe. His voice, low and hot in your ear, took away all of your senses. His hands slipped along your waist, tugging your blouse out from inside of your skirt. His huge black eyes caught yours and he smiled that sweet smile once again. “Never,” you panted. “Never got fucked properly.” He seemed pleased at that, his hand disappearing between your thighs to cup your heat. You whimpered at his knowing fingers brushing against your covered clit. “Until now,” he corrected. “Is there somewhere more private we can go so I can fuck my little slut properly?” “The.. the small boardroom on the other side. Nobody ever uses it.” “While I would love to let everybody hear you whimpering my name, begging for more, I’d rather not be interrupted.” He pressed his thumb into your clit for emphasis. “Me neither.” You sighed, hungry for his touch, but nodded your consent as he dropped his hand, and you tucked your shirt into your skirt again. The boardroom was across the office and you had to get there without raising suspicion. Once he’d managed to hide his erection decently well under his buttoned suit jacket, you opened the door to the servery and ventured outwards into the hall.You gestured for him to follow, getting only a few steps down the hall before you heard voices. You froze, paralyzed and mind racing to try to come up with an explanation. Namjoon appeared, head turned as he spoke to someone around the corner and out of your view. He glanced in your direction and you gestured for him to lead them elsewhere frantically. His eyes flickered to Jungkook standing behind you, still looking cool and calm you imagined, and his eyes flashed with understanding and panic simultaneously. “But before we go,” you heard him say as he turned to face the person he was speaking to. “Why don’t we go visit Min Yoongi? He’s the acting director, he’ll be able to-” you heard the voices trail off down the hall going the other way and you breathed a sigh of relief. Namjoon poked his head out from behind the wall for a split second with a pointed look. 'You owe me’, it said. You blew him a kiss playfully and he rolled his eyes, but caught it anyway. Just a few steps away where Namjoon had stood lay the boardroom, which Jungkook seemed to have found, judging by how his strong hand guided you inside. It was dark, the windows were uncovered but the cloudiness of the day gave you just enough light. “Bad girl, almost getting us caught.” You heard him say behind you. You turned around and saw the same smile on his lips. It was unnerving how the man could look so devastatingly sexy and yet so sweet at the same time. His black hair fell into his eyes, giving him the look of the former. You shivered. “What are you going to do about it?” You challenged with a smirk. He quirked a brow under his messy fringe in surprise. Your smile only grew in anticipation. “Does my little slut want to be punished?” He stalked towards you, and you backed up until you felt the edge of the table hit your butt. “Maybe.” Placing a hand on either side of you, effectively trapping you, he pressed a hot kiss to your lips. “Turn around, baby.” He hissed. With what little space you had, you turned around and bent forward, the table pressing into the tops of your thighs. You felt his hand atop your back to press you flat onto the surface. His hand squeezed your ass through your skirt and you let out a soft groan. “Shh, baby. Bite your sleeve.” “Why-” You let out a soft yelp when you felt his hand collide with your bottom. You felt your center flood with arousal as the warmth of the slap spread through your skin. You took his advice this time, biting down on the sleeve of your blouse as he swatted your butt again, pressing his clothed erection against the tightness of your skirt. You let out a soft whimper. “I know you can take more than this, baby.” His voice was sinful behind you, tempting you like only the devil could. You wiggled your bottom in response, trying to press up against him where you could. “You’re just eager for my cock, aren’t you? Greedy little girl.” He punctuated the sentence with another slap to your ass, the sharpest and most arousing one yet. “Please..” You felt yourself dripping, and he was right, all you could think about was the delicious way his erection was pressing into your ass. You couldn’t even recognize your voice as your own anymore, breathless and whiny as it was. “Not yet. On your knees.” The cool air rushed your skin as he stepped away, and you couldn’t help but rub your thighs together to try and alleviate some of the need. You desperately wanted to touch yourself, and though you would’ve loved to feel his hand against your ass again, you didn’t want any more distractions. “Look at you. So obedient.” He beamed as you sank to your knees, looking up at his gorgeous face, the way he bit the lower lip of his petal pink mouth, and you felt yourself flush. Making quick work of his pants and boxers, you gazed at the length of him, uncomfortably hard. “Be a good girl and suck me off. Maybe then I’ll reward you.” He smirked down at you, hair falling into his black eyes. His smile turned devilish. “Yes, sir.” You heard a groan fall from his lips already at the title, and you licked a wet stripe up the length of him. You felt him shudder, his lean form tensing as the warmth of your mouth encased his hard cock. “Fuck.” He hissed, his hands moving to tangle his fingers in your hair, though he controlled his thrusts. You hollowed out your cheeks, trying to take him as deep down your throat as you could, then twirling your tongue around his leaking tip. The weight of him on your tongue made the heat between your legs almost unbearable, and you sneaked a hand down to rub your neglected clit. “No touching, slut.” You whimpered as you pulled your hand away, feeling the burn return to your core as your orgasm lay farther and farther away. You instead concentrated on the feeling of his fingers tightening gingerly in your hair, the hardness of his thighs, and the softness of his skin as he began thrusting his hips forward. You gagged at the intrusion, and he pulled himself out with a groan, a string of saliva still connecting you to him. “Fuck, I want your mouth so bad, but I want to cum in that pretty pussy more. You’ve been so good for me, baby. On the table.” No longer caring how eager you looked, you shimmied out of your panties and hopped up onto the table. You were soaked; you knew it, he knew it, and the table knew it. He pulled you close to the edge, but pressed you flat onto your back. Taking your legs, he wrapped them around his waist, his warm hand stroking against your folds. You shuddered, letting out a wanton moan at the slightest contact. “God, you’re so wet. Was this just from the spanking? Or sucking me off? You’ve been such an obedient slut, and now I don’t even have to prep you. I could just slip right in,” You gasped at the feeling of one of his fingers slipping into you, glancing towards him to see satisfaction and amusement colouring his beautiful features. Damn, you hated him for being so smug, but the way he’d slipped in another finger and curled them just right - you whined as he pulled his fingers out.  Frustration began flooding you. Never mind, you did hate him. “So ready to be fucked at work, aren’t you? You don’t even care who might hear, you just want my cock, don’t you?” He pressed the tip of himself against your entrance and you almost sobbed in relief. “Yes, I just want your cock, please, Jungkook. Please fuck me properly like only you can. I’m your little slut- oh!” “How can I resist when you beg so prettily?” Tightening your legs around his waist, you felt your eyes closing at the feeling of his hard cock entering between your soaked folds, the relief a blessed feeling. You could almost see his smirk, even with your eyes closed. “Don’t get comfortable, baby. I said a proper fucking.” The pace he set was brutal; his hard cock pounding into you ruthlessly. His grip on your hips was hard as he kept you in place, and you tried your best to move your hips to match him, but it was of little use. He pressed you down harder against the table, and you let him use you the way he wanted. You wanted to scream at the feeling of his thrusts, his large, hot hands gripping into you. You tightened your legs and clenched around him, making his hips stutter.“Oh, fuck-” He hissed, and this time, you smirked. His payback was swift. With trained fingers, he found your clit and pressed his thumb against it, and you felt your hips rise from the table to the high heavens. Fiercely rubbing against it, you felt your eyes begin to roll back into your head as he gripped your hips harder, the sounds of skin slapping ringing out into the room. Your release was coming, you could feel it, and blessedly, Jungkook’s pace was holding steady. You let out a soft whine to warn him, though you were afraid he’d stop. “Is my little slut gonna cum?” You nodded, unable to form words as his thick length filled you over and over again. “Please,” you begged for good measure. “Please let me cum.” “Cum, baby.” He growled, and you felt the spring in your stomach tighten before exploding, his thrusts helping you ride out your high. You soaked yourself, fingers raking down the length of his arms. The pleasure began to ebb away, though, and his thrusts continued. Your relief lasted only a moment when he pulled out, cock still hard and reddened, but only long enough to flip you onto your stomach. There was a pause, and you could hear his roughened voice. “Can you take me to the end?” He held back to avoid overstimulating you until you peered over your shoulder with a smirk at how disheveled he’d become, the once proper businessman. His hair fell into his eyes, his forehead shiny with sweat. “Yes, Jungkook, fuck me.” He slid back into your swollen folds, and you yelped softly, hips wiggling from the sensation. “Come on, baby, I know you can take it.” His own voice sounded rough and fucked out. “I’m almost there, be a good cock slut for me, can you do that?”You whined but nodded, his hand pressing your back into the table as his cock entered you over and over again, pleasure soon bubbling inside of you once again. His fingers found your clit again, which, though sensitive, welcomed the attention. It wasn’t long before you were pushing yourself back up against him, hips meeting his thrust for thrust. “God, fuck, yes-!” You felt him shudder behind you, and the feeling of his hot cum spurting into you. The last few thrusts and the way his thumb and forefinger were tweaking your clit was enough to send you over the edge a second time, collapsing onto the table in a panting mess. You felt him slide out of you, but you were unable to move, unable to think. Pressing your cheek against the cold wood of the table, his hands lingered on your hips to steady you, and you felt him press a light kiss to your shoulder blade before releasing you. Your hot breath steamed the surface of the table as you tried to calm your heart to a normal human pace. You stood up and pulled your skirt back down, then found your discarded underwear and slipped them back on. You’d have to find some way to slip into the bathroom to clean up without being spotted now. “So, why are you working for Seokjin anyway?” You looked over at Jungkook, running his fingers through his hair to try and tame it. He already looked just as collected as before, whereas you felt like a mess. You snorted at his question. “The money, I guess. But I applied to a bunch of places elsewhere. Park Group, Kim Insurance, Jung and Jeon,” you listed off absentmindedly. Jungkook lifted his head from doing his belt and smiled at you, his bunny teeth peeking out from between his sweet smile. “Jung and Jeon, you say?” He fixed the cuffs of his shirt nonchalantly, still stained with coffee, then stuck his hand out for you to shake. “Jeon Jungkook. How would you like to come work for me?”

Love Me Please | Pt. 1Pairing: Taehyung x ReaderGenre: CEO!AU | Angst/FluffWord Count: 1872Author’s Note: I do not own the gif. Credit goes to owner.↠ Masterlist | ↠ Ask↠ Part 2Being the personal assistant of one of Korea’s well known businessman wasn’t easy. Especially, when said businessman was the most morose and irritating person you’ve ever met in your life. To be honest, when you first applied for this job, you did not expect your boss to be a 22-year-old young man. At the beginning, you admired how well he handled his work and company with passion and hard work at such a young age, finding it even attractive to the point where you couldn’t wait to go to work the next morning. Well, that was until he removed that heartwarming smile and showed his true face. Who would have known that said boss was hiding a very conceited personality behind that ‘Oh I’m so hardworking, down to earth and I love my job’ mask? Surprise! You didn’t. Until he started picking at everything you were doing, be it good or bad, giving you harsh comments every now and then, making you want to punch him right in the face. But being the hardworking woman you were, you never gave up and worked even harder, proving to him that no matter what he was doing, you wouldn’t break down as he wished you would.You name is Y/N, and you are going to show your boss, Kim Taehyung, that you’re unbreakable.“Mr. Kim, we need to hurry-“Before you could end your sentence, you covered your eyes with your hands, turning your head around so fast you thought your neck snapped. Taking a deep breath, you clenched your jaw tightly and hissed slightly. “Mr. Kim! The dinner starts in 15 minutes, we need to leave now.““Babe, why don’t you just kick her out?“ You heard the woman sitting on his lap ask with a high pitched voice, her lips still attached on his neck. Chuckling at the question, your boss answered with his raspy voice. “Darling, you know I would, but this dinner is important. My dad has obliged me to go there no matter what.“ “But babe~“ She whined as she pouted her lips.“I’ll see you tonight, sweetheart.“ Gaging at their nicknames for each other, you watched how your boss winked at his–most probably–one night stand as he reached out for his jacket, walking toward you with a smirk plastered on his lips. Rolling your eyes, you opened the door and stepped out of his office as you were looking down to your planer. When you felt his presence beside you, you started talking. “Chairman Kim wanted me to say that this dinner with Mr. Byun is very important. The last dinner you both had didn’t go well, I know. But please try to make sure to convince him to sign the contract, Sir. Otherwise your father will be mad at you.““You’re really talking too much, Y/N.“ Your boss huffed as he nodded to his driver once to affirm him that he could drive now. Taking another deep breath, you tried to calm your anger down. “This dinner is important, Mr. Kim. Please, take it seriously.“Clicking his tongue, he mumbled. “Whatever.“Looks like tonight was going to be a very stressful and long night.“But Sir, your father wants you to apologize!“Glaring at you, Taehyung hissed. “I’m not apologizing, Y/N! You, out of all people, should now that!“Placing your fingers on your temple, you whispered. “I know, Sir. Mr. Byun wasn’t behaving like a professional either but this is really important for your company. This is the best deal we’ve received for this project and everyone worked really hard on it. Please, do it for your workers, Sir..“You watched how his eyes softened after hearing your words. Tilting your head a little bit, you looked him expectantly in the eyes. “Hmm?“Breaking the eye contact, he nodded and mumbled softly. “Okay..“Smiling triumphantly, you leaned back in your chair. Checking the time on your watch, you confirmed. “It’s already 8 o’clock, he should be here any minute-“Just before you could end your sentence, Mr. Byun walked up to your table. Nudging your boss, you whispered. “He’s here.“Now you just had to do one thing; get the signature.“Taehyung, my friend, why aren’t you eating?“ Mr. Byun asked as he smirked at your boss.Placing a fake smile on his face, Taehyung answered. “I’m not hungry, Mr. Byun.““Why did you order food if you’re not hungry. Wait, why do I even care? You’re the one who’s going to pay.“ Mr. Byun laughed shamelessly.Turning your head to your left, you observerd Taehyung’s face, who, by the way, insisted you should sit beside him. His jaw was clenched and his hands were formed into fists, anger running through his whole body.The dinner wasn’t going as smoothly as you hoped it would, the sarky remarks that was leaving Mr. Byun’s mouth turning the atmosphere into an uncomfortable one. Every now and then, you turned your head to your boss and tried to make eye contact with him, making sure that he wouldn’t jump out of his chair and punch Mr. Byun right in the face. “My lovely Y/N, are you just eating a salad?“Hearing your name coming out of Mr. Byun’s mouth in such a way, your whole body tensed. “A-Ah, yes. I’m not that hungry,“ you said while forcing a smile.“Ahh, so you’re taking care of your body, hm?“ He asked again.“E-Ehm, yeah, yeah..““Believe me, sweetheart, I would do the same if I would have such a beautiful body like yours. I wish I had such a beautiful assistant like you. I would work 24/7 and never leave my office.“ he said as he observed your body up and down.You jumped slightly when you heard your boss slam his cutlery on the table. When you turned your head to him, you saw him glaring at the man sitting in front of you, the veins on his neck already visible. Taehyung was angry, very angry.You, on the other hand, didn’t know what to do. You couldn’t ruin this dinner, you had to think about your coworkers who had worked so hard on this project. They deserved the best. So, you took a deep breath and tried to calm down. Cutting his steak into pieces, Mr. Byun asked another inappropriate question. “Sweetheart, are you single?“Gripping your chair, you answered through your gritted teeth. “Yes, I am, Sir.“Don’t ruin this, Y/N! Don’t!“Hm, beautiful.“From the corner of your eye, you saw Taehyung lift his knife up as he glared at Mr. Byun. Immediately, your hand reached towards his hand, taking the knife away from him and giving him his glass filled with water. When you made sure that nothing sharp was near his side, you slightly leaned to him and hissed. “Don’t, Mr. Kim. Don’t forget why we’re here. Here, drink your water.“Thank God, Mr. Byun oblivious to all this since he was enjoying his steak.Looking up from his plate, the man sitting in front of you smiled at your boss. “So, Taehyung. I’m listening to you.“Turning his head to you, Taehyung watched how you nodded at him once. Gulping down, he started talking. “Our last dinner we had a few days ago didn’t went so well. I might have overreacted a little bit. I’m..“ he closed his eyes and tightened his fists, “I’m sorry, Mr. Byun.“Looking up at Mr. Byun, you saw him smiling triumphantly. “That’s how you should do it, my dear friend, Taehuyng.“Every word that was coming out of his most was making Taehyung’s blood boil without thinking about the consequences. Slowly, but surely, he was reaching his limit.You watched how the man sitting in front of you drank his last gulps of water, holding the glass almost in front of your face. “Could one of you bring me water?“Cursing inwardly at him, you forced another smile. “Ah, yes, of course.“ Searching for a waiter in the fancy restaurant, you turned your head from side to side. Taehyung, too, searched for one.Seeing that nobody was anywhere near, Mr. Byun spoke up. “Taehyung, your assistant should pour me some water. I would love to drink the water poured by such a beautiful woman.“Taehyung’s head snapped towards Mr. Byun in a blink of an eye, his jaw almost breaking from the way he was clenching it with such force.The moment you realized that your boss was ready to attack the shameless man, you intervened. Grabbing his arm, you stopped him immediately and spoke up. “I can do it!“Standing up, you searched for a carafe, walking toward Mr. Byun’s side of the table and pouring it in his glass. Placing the glass on the table, you took a step away from him, ready to sit back down on your chair, but stopped when you felt his hand on your wrist. Yanking you down beside him, Mr. Byun wrapped his arm around your shoulder and smiled at you. “Thank you, sweetheart. Now why don’t you just sit here for the rest of the night and accompany me, hm?“That was it, that was the last straw. Without being able to understand what was happening, you were yanked away from Mr. Byun and soon, your boss was punching the man in the face with his blood covered fists. Immediately, you rushed forward and tried to stop your boss, shouting in between his curses. “Mr. Kim! Sir, Please, don’t! Sir, stop! TAEHYUNG!“Hearing his name coming out of your mouth for the first time, Taehyung stopped immediately. Grabbing your wrist, he turned to Mr. Byun and hissed. “If I see you ever again, I will kill you!“With that, he walked out of the restaurant. “Mr. Kim! What do you think you’re doing?! What are we going to say to Chairman Kim now?! You’re father is going to-““He was literally harassing you, Y/N! I’ll kill that bastard!““Do you know how much I struggled to arrange this dinner, Sir?! I begged to so many people so that Mr. Byun would clear his schedule for tonight! You ruined everything!““What should I have done?! Should I have watched how that disrespectful bastard was harassing you in front of my eyes?!““For the sake of your company, yes, Sir! You know how important this project is-““NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOU, Y/N!“ Frozen, you looked at his face. “W-What?“Taking a deep breath, Taehyung ran his fingers through his hair. “I can’t stand seeing him harass you like that! I don’t know why but whenever I see you near a man, I get angry and I have the urge to protect you!“Blinking a few times, you asked hesitantly. “Mr. Kim, what are you talking about-““I think I’m in love with you, Y/N.“Well, shit..

Icy sweat-drops ran down your back on the inside of the white blouse, probably making itself visible through the white colour. You were lucky your face wasn’t sweating - so you didn’t look greasy, but if you stayed for only some minutes more your entire body would be covered in an icy cold sweat. Is this what you’ve dreamed of? Well - the situation itself yes, but the way you ended up here? Not really what you thought would happen. With a gulp of spit mixed with vomit down your throat - you knew that whatever you tried to do, you wouldn’t get away from this situation.  Keep reading

            More Than Anything Else (two) [M]        This took almost two months. I’m sorry! This is unedited, so please excuse any errors.Pairing: Namjoon x ReaderGenre: CEO!au, smut, fluff, angstWords: 12.8kWarnings: Unprotected sex two To say that you felt completely out of place would be an understatement. The mansion was lavish, positively gleaming with the glitz and glamour from the decoration as well as the guests. You pulled at your pencil skirt, feeling overwhelmingly under-dressed looking at the elaborate gowns, jewelry and makeup of the rich specimens around you. You felt a little like a voyeur, head turning, almost involuntarily, in the direction of every immaculately dressed individual who passed by in front of you.For a brief minute, you were so enamored by this party that you forgot your initial intention for being in such a place. You could handle the few side glances and snickers from some snobby rich people. That was hardly a problem. But, the only reason you were prepared to unnecessarily endure it all was so that you could get Namjoon to listen to you, to talk to you and try to resolve this stupid misunderstanding.

            k.th |business attire|        kth x f!readerSummary: Regional Manager Kim TaeHyung works at JinHit Conglomerate, under CEO Kim Namjoon. You, his assistant, are new and bumbling and your mistakes, as well as your skirts, are driving him crazy.OR The one where Taehyung can’t survive without getting you out of your skirt.wc: 10,557warnings: smut. smut smut smut smut. a little bit of fluff because tae is fluffy. power dynamics, subtle dom!Tae/sub!reader (like blink and you miss it), unprotected sex (please practice safe sex), office sexual harassment (if this happens to you in real life please report them), lots of growling, spanking, fingering, edging, threat of orgasm denial, lite bondage (blink and miss it), “punishment”“Kim, report back to me after the 11 o'clock tomorrow.”The CEO’s voice was firm but quiet, not needing to be loud to command attention. CEO Kim Namjoon had recently taken over for his aging father, and Taehyung was thankful to be working under the younger man; the vibe in the office had shifted to one that was more relaxed, though still respectable.“Sir.” Kim Taehyung bowed his head before standing up from the large table, gathering his folders and the papers falling out of them, dismissed from the office after the morning briefing.Taehyung left the briefing room, walking down the hall to take the elevator down to return to his office, which was a beautiful glass windowed corner workplace. The elevator opened up to the 48th floor, and Taehyung stepped out.“Um, sir? Mr. Kim?” Your soft voice came from behind Taehyung as you followed him dutifully back towards his office. He paused his walk mid-stride, turning slowly to look back over his shoulder at you, an eyebrow raised into his blonde hair. He was tall, lean, and had the face of a model; easily the most attractive person you had ever had the pleasure of working under in your entire life. Keep reading

            — charmolypi [prologue; m.] | jhs; jjk        ⇁ pairings: (Hoseok or Jungkook) ??? x reader;⇁ genre: smut, fluff | CEO/Secretary AU⇁ warnings: boss/subordinate relationship, implied sexual relations;⇁ word count: 910⇁ summary: Waking up in the wrong bed is never easy. Unless it’s with him.  ↳ previous // masterlist // next  The sound of the blaring alarm made you immediately sit up in bed, the awful realization that you had to get up and get ready for work hitting you as you looked around the room, taking in the over-the-top decor you were so used to, as well as the scattered clothes on the plush carpet right in front of the bed. Stopping the alarm, you resisted the urge to just drop back in bed and instead yawned and stretched, peeking to the side where the dark-haired male was sleeping peacefully, the sound of the alarm having done little to wake him up - but you weren’t surprised, familiar with what it took to get him to actually get out of bed. He shifted just slightly, a grimace on his face for just a moment before you turned off your phone and gave yourself a moment to look over his sleeping form, eyes passing over rippling muscle as he readjusted to your now empty side of the bed and scrunched his face once loose curls tickled his nose, his hair having fallen over his eyes.It took your brain a moment to rewire and make you realize that you didn’t have the clothing and makeup you needed for work, but you also didn’t have time to go home and get them before you had to clock in, so without a second thought you jumped out of the bed and made for the bathroom, wincing at the soreness between your legs, that you hadn’t even realized was there before, but choosing to ignore it altogether as you rushed into the shower and turned on the water, washing up, your mind blank and tired, barely registering the automatic movements you made as you dried up and stopped in front of the mirror, looking at the purple and red marks that adorned your neck, collarbones and went all the way down your cleavage, your mind immediately wondering why you hadn’t considered telling him to stop before it was too late the night before. Not that it mattered now. Keep reading
