  Please use this form to submit a request regarding a deceased Squarespace customer’s site. Our deepest condolences go out to you and your family during this time, and we appreciate your patience as we work through your request.
Due to privacy concerns and restrictions, we unfortunately can't provide you with administrative control of the site. However, if an immediate family member or legal representative completes the form below, we may be able to grant Billing permissions so the site can remain active or cancel any active subscriptions.
Note that Billing permissions don't include the ability to edit the site's content. You can read more about this here.
A note regarding Squarespace 5 sites:
Squarespace 5, our legacy platform, doesn't allow permissions to be edited. However, we can cancel or remove the site.

            Adding Pinterest Save buttons
            Last updated August 26, 2020 16:44
              Sections
            Add Save buttons to your site to encourage visitors to share your content on Pinterest. Save buttons appear when hovering over images in Image Blocks, products, blog posts, and certain Gallery Blocks.
Before you begin
By enabling Save buttons, you agree to Pinterest's developer terms.
Pins from a Blog Page are more likely to show an accurate image when a visitor pins from the individual post, rather than the main Blog Page. You can encourage this by using excerpts.
If a product in a pin has price variants, the lowest price will display in the pin.
Where Save buttons display
When enabled, Save buttons can display over:
Image Blocks in blog posts and Layout Pages
Gallery Blocks in blog posts (Slideshow, Stacked, and Grid designs)
Gallery Blocks in Layout Pages (version 7.0 only)
Images in Products Pages
Save buttons never display over:
Any images smaller than 119px × 119px 
Images added to Portfolio Pages and sub-pages
Image lightboxes
Gallery Page images
Gallery Blocks using the Carousel design
Gallery section images
Product Block images
Summary Block images
Videos added to Gallery Pages, Gallery Blocks, or Video Blocks
Enable the Save button
To enable Save buttons:
Computer
Squarespace App
In the Home Menu, click Marketing, then click Pinterest Save Buttons.
From the drop-down menu, select where the Save button will appear on your site:
Select Enabled for Blogs to add the buttons to Image Blocks and Gallery Blocks in blog posts only. The buttons won't appear on thumbnail images.
Select Enabled for Blogs, Pages and Products to add the buttons to Image Blocks, Gallery Blocks, and Product Page images.
Tap the Settings icon, tap Pinterest Save Buttons, then tap the Enabled toggle on.
Tap Visibility to select where the Save button will appear on your site:
Select Blogs to add the buttons to Image Blocks and Gallery Blocks in blog posts only. The buttons won't appear on thumbnail images.
Select Blogs, Pages and Products to add the buttons to Image Blocks, Gallery Blocks, and Product Page images.
Style the button
After enabling the Save button, you can style its appearance.
Computer
Squarespace App
Additional style options appear when you select where the button appears. Customize these options using the drop-down menus. As you select from different options, a preview of a Save button appears below.
Size - Small or Large
Shape - Rectangle or Circle
When you're done customizing your Save button, click Save.
Customize these options by tapping into the corresponding menus. As you select from different options, a preview of a Save button appears below.
Size - Small or Large
Shape - Rectangle or Circle
When you're done customizing your Save button, tap Back, then tap Save. 
Pinterest Rich Pins
