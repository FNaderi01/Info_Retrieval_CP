    Summary
      Whether it's real or not, Amy McManus finds herself in Thedas and severely limited by aphasia and suspicion. It's hard to warn people about the coming doom when you can't talk properly, and it's even worse when they might think you're the enemy. At the best, she's thought of as odd or addled, and at the worst she knows too much and could be dangerous. Honestly, what's a modern girl to do?
