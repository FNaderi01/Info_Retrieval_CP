    Summary
      The truth is a strange thing. Sometimes it can be so strange that a person could only have the vague notion of it. From there, a person could decide what could be construed as the truth and what would be construed as the lie.No one had known this better than the Kahnwald family, who, despite being a family, had never really known each other as much as they had thought they did. But maybe no one really knows what a person is like… perhaps one could only have a vague notion, just like the truth.---A Kahnwald family fanfic. A look at this family starting from the 1980s and ending in the 1900s. SPOILERS FOR ALL THREE SEASONS.

    Summary
      Kronos was called the crooked one for good reason.Assaulting Olympus when a prophecy, despite what the Fates say, was rigged against him? Merely a ruse to something greater.No, with Gaea rising and the emperors of old waiting in the wings, it was not the opportune time to take Olympus. Let them think that they had vanquished him. Let them enjoy their false victory. Let his children and their offspring defeat the opposition for him, clearing a path for his ascension. But for now, he will march willingly to his defeat. As with the (unwilling) assistance of the child of Hermes, two of the three cyclopes that forged weapons of the Olympians, his most trusted titans, and an unfulfilled prophecy, Olympus will be his.It's only a matter of time...

    Summary
      “They’re calling it Restoration Day,” Glimmer says, clasping her hands together, “because peace, freedom, and magic were restored to Etheria.”  The first party is relatively small.  Yet it grows, as they do, every year.
