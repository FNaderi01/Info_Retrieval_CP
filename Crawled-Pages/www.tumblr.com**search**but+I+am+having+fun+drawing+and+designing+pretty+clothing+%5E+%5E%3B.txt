(He‚Äôs probably pre-teen-ish around here, maybe, idk)Yasha still more or less thinks of himself as a boy (when he can be bothered to think about it at all) but loves flowers, pastels, and anything soft and gentle (in harsh contrast to his blunt as a bludgeon personality). And most importantly, he kinda just really hates wearing pants and underwear, when he can get away with full nudity‚Ä¶ He takes the young!Victor flower fairy aesthetic to the next level. He can be very picky about what he wears, and usually prefers expensive but relatively unknown specialty brands. His parents, especially Victor, are more than happy to indulge his tastes.~~IF YOU ARE NEW TO THIS AU: It‚Äôs a Yuri!!! on Ice AU, Yuuri-centric with end-game polyamory in an ABO 
setting, Yuuri gets married to four mates (Victor, Yurio, Phichit, Minami)

            How to do a sigil        Yes hello I am a Alex and this is a thing of how I do a witchcraft. If you do this a certain way feel free to not listen. If you don‚Äôt like the way I do it lit, donut do it this way :3 that is allWhat is a sigil?‚Äúan inscribed or painted symbol considered to have magical power.‚Äù -googleaka a digital or physical painting/drawing/craving/or anything with a design that is given a certain meaning by the person who made it.What are sigils used for?The maker draws a doodle (more or less) and charges it with their intent.¬†Can anybody make one?Anyone :3How complicated does it have to be/look like?It shouldn‚Äôt be that hard or pretty, as long as it pleases you it is fineWhat materials do you gotta use?Whatever you got. digital or physical. Paper and pencil/pen/blood/wax/anything - Wood drawing things/knife to carveLiterally a n y t h i n gDo sigils have to be aesthetically pleasing?Nope :3 just has to have meaning it you/someone you‚Äôre making it forDo you have to be a witch to use sigils?No you don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs up to you and your beliefs¬†Where can you put sigils?*cracks knuckles* Shoes, binders, behind phone cases, under tables, under chairs, on your nails with sharpies then put nail polish over it, in your car, in a pillow, draw them on yourself (thighs, stomachs, arms, whatever), clothes tags, out of ketchup on your food, literally anything and everything you can think ofCan I cut out a sigil for a keychain or somethin?Yes, and you can put them on your alter, hang em in a car, etc¬†Can you use sigils in spells?Yes you can, just like tarot cards and oracle cardsCan you have two different sigils for the same thing?Yes you can (ex. ¬†if you have one for happiness, but want to make another one for happiness, you can draw a different design) (ex. 2- if you see someone make one to ward off depression and want to make one for the same reason, you can make one but with a different design)How do you¬†‚Äúactivate‚Äù a sigil?As soon as you draw it, it‚Äôs activated. However if you want to give it a little umph, you can bury them, burn them, submerge it in water, etc. If burning you can wafe (is that even a word) an object through the smoke to charge it with your intentAre sigils used for cursing/hexing too?Sure can be, up to you and your beliefs/craftWhat all can you use sigils for?Everything. happiness, good luck, help to study, anti*illness*, help your plants grow, help your phone battery last longer, help Kendall to not be a bitch, the list is endlessAnd finally, how do you a sigil?Understand what you want the sigil for, I would suggest a simple one at first so I‚Äôm going to explain how to do it for happinessGather your resources, again I‚Äôm doing a easy one so I am going to¬†‚Äúuse‚Äù a pencil and paperGet in the mindset of the intent you are going for, so this one is happy. Maybe do some stretching before and clear your mindNow that you‚Äôre all razzle dazzled in a happy mood, close you eyes and thing, what shape in happiness to you right in that moment. Do you thing it‚Äôs a bunch of lines or even as simple as a heart? Thing about itNow if you have trouble with step 4 (like I do, ADHD is a lil bitch) play some music that makes you happy or a movie. Does Frozen make you happy? Maybe draw a lil snowflakeNow as fun as it is to draw an elaborate sigil, remember, this can go into your Grimoire or BoS for you to copy onto other things¬†The most important thing now,Magic requires consentPlease don‚Äôt put¬†‚ÄúMake Justin love me‚ÄùInstead you can put¬†‚ÄúAttract someone who would love me that has the same traits as Justin‚ÄùStay safe beans and happy sigiling!(is that a word)

littlelavendeer ¬†asked:Do you have any theories about the mural?? They showed the red lyrium symbol and he sounds so exhausted and I would love to hear your theories!! üê∫üñ§Ok, so my initial gut reaction‚Ä¶ taking into account that my DA lore is pretty rusty. (I don‚Äôt even know where I put my World of Thedas volumes after cleaning my desk ages ago‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so ashamed.)Now, the bit of the mural has me wondering if I am reading WAY too much into things (totally possible, it‚Äôs late and I‚Äôm hyped):We can clearly see both Solas and the Dread Wolf‚Ä¶ specifically the version of the symbol used on his Tower tarot card.Except now he‚Äôs not leading it.In The Tower, the wolf looms over him, close behind as he walks away, both of them facing the same direction. When it makes an appearance in that mural we find in Trespasser‚Ä¶ again, Solas is moving forward and the wolf is following close behind.Maybe it‚Äôs not significant. Maybe standing before it and raising his hand is supposed to indicate summoning it, or commanding it, rather than opposition to it. But I do find it interesting to think about, nonetheless.Quick Edit:¬†As soon as I hit post a friend pointed out that this thing looks like the red lyrium idol from DA2 and they are 100% right.Trouble is, it‚Äôs ancient AF and I know nothing about it.¬†So I‚Äôm gonna toss my other speculation under the cut that might have absolutely zero to do with DA4, but you get to learn fun things about mummies and Nevarran apocalypse cults that worship Darkspawn.Anyway, proceed: Keep reading

When I first saw this photo it instantly reminded me of Moicy.I usually do not finish my art because I am a lazy procrastinating uni student But I really wanted to draw this so badly (for several months, actually) So as soon as my finals were sorted out I just jumped right into it. Even though it was, like, 80% reference 20% me this was really fun &amp; rewarding and I am quite proud of it!God it‚Äôs been sooooo long since I have seriously drawn/finished anything!(I really wanted to make Mercy wear that black turtleneck-jeans-labcoat combo that she was wearing in the uprising comic. As for Moira, well, the clothing choice was obvious‚ÄìI live for dapper Moira. Right after I finished my lineart¬†for Moira, I remembered that there was a pic of cannon¬†Moira wearing pretty much like this‚Ä¶and that Moira has her own specially designed labcoat. But I was to lazy to change my lineart¬†so she‚Äôs just wearing a plain white labcoat instead.)Progress:Lineart-MoiraLineart-MercyBase ColoringShading

(please click for better resolution tumblr is terrible)a tarot card i made for a challenge on amino!! this was really fun and i am pretty dang proud of how it turned out so i‚Äôm posting it here too ;0shoutout to @1floweredcrown for helping me w/ a bit of the designthoughts on the design process under the cutokay soi chose the sun since upright it is supposed to represent fun, warmth, success, positivity, vitality, and damn if that ain‚Äôt musical philip idk what isi wanted to keep all the symbolic elements from the original popular form of the card, because you know, it is still supposed to be used for tarot readings, right? so i kept the form of the sun‚Äôs rays, the four sunflowers, the ribbon/cloth, the horse; and i gues the child is supposed to be pip, but a little less innocent, because he‚Äôs not some pure child anymore; he‚Äôs got his own things to hide and his own things that aren‚Äôt good. also i‚Äôm not drawing him naked what the fuckthe whole¬†‚Äúnot totally pure‚Äù also ties in to the tangle of vines from the sunflowersthe filigree just‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ i thought it would look nice. it looked nice so i added itthe general direction was supposed to be up, so a large part of it is dedicated to a sort of double-helix form that swirls towards the top, around the sun, and where philip is aiming; the skyi also wanted it to be reversible since you know, cards do come out reversed in tarot readings, and the reverse of the sun is temporary depression (coughitsquietuptowncough) and/or lack of success (coughtheduelcough). so if you turned it upside down, eliza and alexander are suddenly at the top, suddenly they are the focus when before they were lost in the details of tangles and vines, and suddenly they are There and there‚Äôs no way you can miss them. and if you didn‚Äôt see them before, well, now you have, and there‚Äôs no way of not noticing them now ;Uthe thirteen colony stars are there just because i could honestlyand the border was basically filler (shrug)

Lys Noire: Page TwoLys Noire Page One‚Äì it‚Äôs up!¬†Lys Noire is an AU fancomic I am making, based on the incredible Daughter of the Lilies comic by @bludragongal. You can follow along with the tag #lysnoireTRANSCRIPT: (because my handwriting is pretty dreadful)O: Name is Orrig. Private Eye. Is not glamorous job, ya, pay is not so good either. But important.O: City is dangerous place. People sometimes need someone they can trust, someone strong. Vhen things get bad, they come to us.Some thoughts:1) If you‚Äôve seen my previous art, you might notice that I borrowed some design elements from @qsy-draws-a-lot‚Äòs version of these characters because it‚Äôs amazing, why wouldn‚Äôt I? (Same goes for Thistle on the next page)2) Water is hard to draw. Like, seriously. If I‚Äôd known how hard it is to draw I probably would‚Äôve had this take place on a sunny day.3) Those wing-tip shoes Orrig is wearing are *completely* impractical for the rain, but let‚Äôs be honest‚Äì I‚Äôm just doing this because I want to draw these babies in pretty clothes. I probably should‚Äôve saved myself some trouble and written this as a fashion-model-AU instead. (No, seriously, there is a plot, I promise)If you‚Äôre actually reading this‚Äì thank you! I‚Äôm still kind of nervous: I‚Äôve tried to draw comics before but this is my first time putting something up where actual flesh-and-blood humans can see it. It‚Äôs going to be a crazy ride but hopefully a fun one? In any case, I‚Äôm humbled and delighted that people seem to like what I have so far. I‚Äôll try not to let you down!¬†
