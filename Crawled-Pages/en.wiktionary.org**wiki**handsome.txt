Etymology[edit]
From Middle English handsum, hondsom, equivalent to hand +‎ -some. Compare Dutch handzaam, German Low German handsaam. The original sense was ‘easy to handle or use’, hence ‘suitable’ and ‘apt, clever’ (mid 16th century), giving rise to the current appreciatory senses (late 16th century).
Pronunciation[edit]
IPA(key): /ˈhæn.səm/[1] or occasionally /ˈhænd.səm/[2]~/ˈhænt.səm/[3]
