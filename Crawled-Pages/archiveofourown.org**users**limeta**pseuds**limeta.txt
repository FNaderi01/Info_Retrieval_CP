    Summary
      The world believes Lord Voldemort's been dead since 1981. He wishes for it to stay that way, thank you. It is 1998, now, and Hermione Granger signs up for an international mentorship program as a stepping stone for her after Hogwarts life. Draco Malfoy, never to be one-upped, signs up for the same program and scores Gilderoy Lockhart as his mentor, knowing he is Hermione's first choice. Meanwhile, Hermione is stuck with some obscure, hermit NOBODY that can talk to snakes. Ugh. Her life is the worst.Or:Hermione Granger has no idea what she has gotten herself into, all while Tom Riddle plays an American persona very, very badly. Not long into their mentorship, the anonymity of Tom Riddle fades and he must face consequences for his crimes.OR:Abraxas Malfoy loves Tom Riddle. Even though it is very difficult to do so.

    Summary
      “So how do you know?” “I just do.” Avery shrugs. “It’s like…”He doesn’t finish the sentence, and the conversation feels awkward. It occurs to Riddle that this might make Avery walk away, along with all future alliances. “Like if you know that you’re born to rule the world, but everyone looks at you and just sees a sixteen-year-old orphan?” he tries. Avery gives Riddle a strange look. “No, not at all like that, because you are a sixteen-year-old orphan and that’s not going to stop you from ruling the world someday. This—” he gestures at himself. “This isn’t something that’s going to just change through hard work.”(Expelli-gender 2020)
