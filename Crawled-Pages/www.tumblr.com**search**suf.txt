5ok so I‚Äôm really into the Steven Universe x Gravity Falls crossover!!!!¬†honestly, I don‚Äôt really see Steven vibing with the residents of Gravity Falls, so I don‚Äôt see him voluntarily staying there, let alone working there, until he‚Äôs made a few connections with a few people there. I like the idea that he‚Äôd decide to work there for the summer because he became friends with Soos and he likes hanging out with the twins.¬†I also looooove the idea that Steven is super gullible for all the¬†‚Äú‚Äù‚Äùoddities‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù. Considering magic and aliens and monsters are all very very real for him, he doesn‚Äôt really have any reason to be skeptical, especially towards the stuff he knows isn‚Äôt just gem-related. Also, he trusts Soos, and Soos genuinely believes in a lot of it lmaooo
