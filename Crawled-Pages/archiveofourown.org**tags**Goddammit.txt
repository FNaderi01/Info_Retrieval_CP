    Summary
      Thankfully the pupils don’t seem to notice that anything has changed.
Besides Alex who asks Erik three mornings after the end why he’s in such a foul temper.
(Charles doesn’t comment on the knife that flies past them all at the table. He just raises an eyebrow and carries on reading his newspaper.)
It’s Moira who finally asks if everything is alright.
And it’s Erik who tells her to keep her nose out of their business.

    Summary
      Birthday mmm's and it's the only sound in the room for hours, or perhaps only minutes but the practice of keeping time does not apply here, too many distractions in the disarray of one's hair or the exciting touches that catch just on the edge of where they should be.

    Summary
      Okay, fine, show: season 5 happened. And not because of whammying. It happened because if we buy these characters as people (which, eh, iffy), then we also have to buy that, being people, they will do stupid, ill-advised things. They will make bad choices and get things very very wrong. But then circumstances could change, and they might get the chance to put those things right again.

Now she has to survive a loveless marriage with him. However, an unexpected complication mid-voyage might overturn their buried feelings, as well as their boat.

    Summary
      From a young age, Izuku had to hide his quirk. At first he did it because his dad asked him to, because it was something special that he could do with him. It wasn't too long before he started hiding it in shame. When he finally meets his idol, All Might, Izuku decides he can't live like that anymore. He has to take down his villainous father, All for One, no matter how much it hurts.Basically, I looked at some fan theories about Dr Tsubasa, All for One, and Izuku and then decided, 'Hey, I want to make a fic.'

    Summary
      Kai Chisaki became Izuku's everything. 
After kidnapping him when he was 12, torturing him for information on his villainous father, and letting him go with the promise of keeping his mouth shut, the young Yakuza ends up ordering Kurono to adopt Izuku for two reasons. 
Izuku was quirkless, and despite all of the starvation and torture he was forced to endure, the pre-teen still held some form of kindness towards him. 
In the harsh and unforgiving world that Kai lived in, he was more than curious to observe and exploit Izuku's kindness that he saw as an anomaly. And that's precisely what he does as he broke Izuku and built him back up to live for him and what he wanted. 
2 years later, he goes too far one night and starts developing a deeper obsession over the teen while also beginning to feel regret. So, in a rash decision that seemed logical at the time, he lets Izuku acquire a quirk and enroll in UA the following year, all to satisfy the small urge for Izuku to be happy. 
But what will happen when it's now the second semester of Izuku's first year, and the Shie Hassaikai get arrested due to an anonymous tip-off to their base and Kai's plans?

    Summary
      “I-“ He tried choking out, mind looking explanations for this strange phenomenon, anything and everything that could explain what just had happened to him.He paused.One for All.“Oh no, no, no, it’s a new quirk isn’t it?” He stuttered out quietly, hands gripping tighter at his hair.  It was the only thing that made sense, he hadn’t really been outside of the dorms the past few days and he didn’t know anyone that had such a quirk in UA, so the only logical conclusion was, in fact, One for All.His breathing hitched, realizing the implications of that.

    Summary
      Half an hour after Kirishima had left, there was a knock on the door. Katsuki had a beer in his hand and walked over to the door. Mumbling under his breath, “fucking shitty hair forgot his fucking keys again..” to himself. 
Katsuki opened the door, he looked from the dripping wet Kirishima to the equally soaked male he had gone to pick up. When he saw the familiar tangle of green hair and freckles, he choked on his drink. “The fuck…?” he half whispered.

Or, the one where Izuku has a past that he finds hard to talk about. Can he build himself back up with the help of his new friends, and re-kindle a relationship with his childhood friend?

Nothing comes easily:  danger and harrowing echoes of their ordeal shadow every step they take.

    Summary
      Kokichi was never beautiful. 
He realized that as he looked at pictures of him when he was young. Ugly, small, useless. All the nights he stood posing in front of the mirror, looking himself over. Checking for flaws, mistakes, blemishes. It had him hating every ounce of skin he left out for the public eye. He felt assaulted with stares, even when his Instagram page blows up every single post, he hates it, he just hates it.
