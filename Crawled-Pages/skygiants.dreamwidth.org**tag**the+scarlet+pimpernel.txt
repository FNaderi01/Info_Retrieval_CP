I've been saving Sir Percy Hits Back for ages - it's the last Pimpernel book chronologically, and, MORE IMPORTANTLY, it's The One Where Percy! Saves! Chauvelin's! Daughter! from the Guillotine!!!!...I've now just spoiled the whole thing for you, because the book itself plays coy with the fact that sweet little Fleurette's darling Bibi is in fact Percy's Nemesis Chauvelin for a good half the text, and then tries to convince you that Percy might let Fleurette go to the guillotine in order to get revenge, but a.) the only reason to care about this book is the fact that Fleurette is Chauvelin's daughter and b.) everyone except Chauvelin knows exactly how things are determined to play out from there. Reasons this is not a good book:- Fleurette is a virtuous innocent who believes in God, is vaguely appalled by the revolution without knowing anything about it or her father's involvement with it, and is best friends with the aristocrats down the road? I refuse to believe it's possible that any child raised by Chauvelin would turn out this way, it defies all logic except Orczy Heroine Logic - the villain is the peasant girl who was abandoned by Fleurette's nursemaid to a life of drudgery so that said nursemaid could instead look after Fleurette; the narrative has little to no sympathy for her- after a while you have to stop and wonder at the fact that Percy's favorite method of rescuing people is 'bring them to trial! incite a riot! whisk them away while everyone else is rioting, presumably causing numerous injuries and a great deal of property damage in the process!' I can believe this was the best way to rescue someone once, maybe, but every time, Percy??? - we never get any narrative follow-through on Fleurette's discovery that her father is a major revolutionary figure and has signed execution warrants for NUMEROUS people, including several of her friends;- Chauvelin doesn't even think about Percy until like 60% of the way through the bookReasons this is nonetheless an enjoyable book:- Fleurette's boyfriend is not an endangered aristocrat but in fact the perfectly nice peasant son of the grocer down the street? I'm genuinely astonished that Orczy with her deep-rooted classism lets this play out happily for Innately Noble Fleurette, daughter of Former Aristocrat Chauvelin - Fleurette and Chauvelin's father-daughter relationship is actually really genuinely cute and Orczy does a pretty solid job balancing Chauvelin the Good Dad against Chauvelin Who Is Still Perfectly Happy To Execute Literally Anybody Else - at one point Percy steals Chauvelin's carriage, and I thought it was all part of a clever scheme related to Fleurette, but no, actually at that point Percy had no idea that Fleurette and Chauvelin were related and there was no carriage-related plan whatsoever, he just couldn't resist a single opportunity to troll Chauvelin for shits and giggles- there is honestly not anywhere near as much Sexy Kate Beaton Nemesis content as I'd hoped on seeing the premise but what there is ... it's good. It's good content.( quotes under the cut )

I have a vague mission to clean out some of the drawers in my room at my parents' house. I didn't get much time to poke through things this time around, but during a cursory drawer investigation I discovered in my 9th-grade Latin notebook a horrifying treasure trove. ( Doodles, circa 2000 )As a sidenote, I found this gallery of wonders in a drawer that also contained a.) a very argumentative draft of a co-written melodrama about WWII, circa 2002, and b.) four handwritten pages of a fantasy story about four quarreling siblings who gain magical rings, at a guess written approximately circa 1998, which ends abruptly and is followed by an also handwritten poster reading 'END THE DEATH PENALTY' above a drawing of a bloody axe. I forgot to take a photo of that particular masterpiece.

So I read Diana Peterfreund's Across a Star-Swept Sea, which is the sequel to For Darkness Shows The Stars.  The pres of For Darkness Shows the Stars was that's post-apocalyptic Persuasion, and when I read it last year I really enjoyed it!I have more mixed feelings about Across a Star-Swept Sea, which is post-apocalyptic Scarlet Pimpernel retelling starring a female Percy Blakeney and which therefore should have been 110% up my alley.  Some of that is the setup, which I felt kind of weird about in For Darkness Shows the Stars, and I couldn't pinpoint or explain exactly why at the time so I ignored it; the best way I have to say it is that the design of the post-apocalyptic setup kind of flattens fairly complicated issues of neurodiversity.  And even though Across the Star-Swept Sea is in some ways actually better and less flattening about that, the way it's used and made a plot point made me feel more uncomfortable.  But that might be just me?  I don't know!  Anyway, I don't feel qualified to talk about that, although if anybody does want to talk about that I FULLY WELCOME you to, please, let's have that conversation!Anyway what I do feel qualified to talk about is SCARLET PIMPERNEL AUS, so ... let's talk about that instead!Scarlet Pimpernel AU stuff I really liked:- the fact that Lady Percy Blakeney (okay, "Persis Blake") has a circle of female schoolfriends who correspond to the Prince of Wales and the members of the League.  The Andrew Ffoulkes equivalent is named ANDRISSE.  This is actually my favorite thing.  Yes, please, leagues of women fighting evil together! - the fact that Armand St. Just almost always acts fourteen anyway, so making him a fourteen-year-old girl is both perfect and ... results in that character actually being MORE competent and effective than in the original- the fact that Dude Marguerite is just as overall useless at rescuing Percy as Original Marguerite is- the fact that Lady Chauvelin is not in love with Dude Marguerite (which I was afraid of and would have been awful) but just really mad that her fake cousin/BFF ditched her AND THE REVOLUTION- the fact that there is a scene in which Persis Blake makes up stupid rhymes.  They are not, sadly, as stupid as in the original.  Still, she makes up stupid rhymes, which I respect.- the fact that no one is white- the fact that there are a lot of descriptions of really over-the-top and elaborate fashionScarlet Pimpernel AU stuff I did not like:- PERSIS BLAKE IS NOT HAVING ENOUGH FUNOkay, here is the thing -- and, okay, a few posts back I called this type of character the Troll Hero, so let's keep going with that.  The thing about the Troll Hero, and Percy Blakeney is kind of the epitome of the Troll Hero, is that the archetype involves a level of EXTREME self-confidence that hits the point of arrogance.  Percy Blakeney can pull off his Scarlet Pimpernel masquerade because he genuinely does not care what other people think of him.  He knows he's amazing.  If everybody's laughing at him, that's even better!  The ultimate joke is always on them, because he knows he's in control, and he can manipulate other people to do what he wants (you know, for the greater good).  And he loves it.  (Until Marguerite, and angst, etc., but this is the gist.)Who writes women like that?Who writes women who are so confident in themselves, who are so aware of the fact that they're smarter than everyone around them that it literally does not matter what the rest of the world thinks?  Who writes women who are laughing at everyone else around them all the time?  Who are laughing at everyone else around them all the time, heroically?Almost nobody writes women like that.  People hate female characters like that.  A woman who's confident enough to know she's smarter than other people?  God, no!  What a bitch!  Persis Blake does not have that level of rock-solid confidence.  Persis Blake is afraid of her mask slipping; she's distressed at the lies she has to tell to the people around her; she's angry, she's frustrated, she's worried.  And these are all completely reasonable reactions to have to her situation, but -- man, most of the time it seems like she's not having ANY fun.Persis Blake is not at all a bad character, but ... guys, I just really want some more female troll heroes.  I want them to know they're smarter than everyone around them, and to be right.  I want them to be total jerks.  I want them to have SO MUCH FUN.

For December 8th, evewithanapple asked me about my least favorite playwright/composers and why!  . . . I don't actually have a lot of least favorites, because when it comes to musical theater, I really love things that are terrible . . . so I am going to seize the opportunity to do the exact opposite and talk instead about my FAVORITE terrible playwright/composer, ~*~*~Frank Wildhorn~*~*~*~.  Frank Wildhorn, y'all.  FRANK WILDHORN.  Frank Wildhorn is an extremely prolific writer of amazingly cheesy musicals.  All of his work is committed to being as spectacularly over-the-top as possible and none of it is at all committed to sounding any different from his previous work.  I have experienced nowhere near all of his oeuvre, but I am COMMITTED to expanding my knowledge whenever I get a chance.  Wildhorn musicals with which I am familiar (and which I have picspammed previously on my DW) include:The Scarlet Pimpernel, which I actually love completely unironically in all of its over-the-top glory.  This musical was my formative Scarlet Pimpernel iteration.  ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES.Jekyll and Hyde, which I watched whenever it came over PBS when I was a kid, and will still watch whenever I have the opportunity, and which is HILARIOUSLY TERRIBLE.  Or at least the version with which I am familiar with, starring DAVID HASSELHOFF, is hilariously terrible.  Jekyll's inexplicable daddy issues!  Lucy the Sexy Prostitute and Emma the Pure Fiancee and the absolute textbook virgin/whore dichotomy!  "Confrontation," in which the Hoff wears HALF A WIG and flings his hair back and forth like he just don't care before ripping open his shirt in a rage-driven frenzy!  Oh, Jekyll and Hyde.  What an amazing piece of musical theater.Wonderland, a musically derivative but visually spectacular musical in which our heroine -- having had her marriage founder because she is the sole breadwinner -- dreams about her estranged husband rescuing her from her dark side, who wants to take over the kingdom of Wonderland from her mother-in-law.  Then this saves her marriage.  THANKS, FRANK WILDHORN.  I am also a little bit familiar with The Count of Monte Cristo because of that half a kdrama I watched which was about a production of Wildhorn's Count of Monte Cristo, but seeing that show in full is absolutely on my bucket list because over-the-top Dumasian revenge is EXACTLY the kind of thing Wildhorn is best suited for.  Frank Wildhorn's current projects include a musical about Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald, which I feel confident will include a lot of really dramatically angsty power ballads and a lot of sentimental and hugely problematic tropes about mental illness, and Excalibur, which is a Frank Wildhorn musical ABOUT KING ARTHUR oh my god it's going to be so bad, I'M SO THERE.But let's be real, when it comes to Frank Wildhorn, I am always there.  It is a beautiful hatemance for the ages.  No matter how much bad his stuff gets, no matter how I may be seething with rage 3/4 of the way through the show, I SWEAR TO YOU, I WILL BE THERE!

So for Yuletide, my roommate innerbrat wrote A Complex Problem, an AU of the Scarlet Pimpernel where everything is the same except Percy Blakeney is Peggy Blakeney and EVERYONE IS LESBIANS.Obviously this is, like, the best thing ever and you should all go read it, but the other thing this meant is that we spent a lot of time in December watching various versions of The Scarlet Pimpernel, including the takarazuka production of Frank Wildhorn's Scarlet Pimpernel musical.    For those of you unfamiliar with takarazuka, takarazuka is a Japanese musical theater form in which all the roles are played by women.  Takarazuka tends to feature epic drama and super extravagant costumes and glorious musical set pieces and a million bajillion sparkles.  This means that takarazuka is basically the perfect way to convey the epic glory of Frank Wildhorn, who is ALL ABOUT staging as much of an epic extragavanza as humanly possible.The download that we used was all in Japanese with no subtitles, but fortunately Debi and I have Wildhorn's Scarlet Pimpernel basically memorized (NO SHAME) and were therefore able to follow nearly all of the story . . . we think.  ( Picspam under the cut! )

First of all, your regularly scheduled reminder: fma_ladyfest signups are closing in two days!  We have a multitude of awesome prompts already, and will continue to be ridiculously excited about this upcoming round until you are all sick of hearing about it and probably for a while after that. :DSecond, the last of moonyazu9's top five requests for me: top five musicals, ( cut for embedded video! )And now that I have talked at great length about my deep and true and slightly embarrassing love for musical theater, I find myself curious.  I know there are some of you reading this who love musicals like I do, and there are some others who find it a completely inexplicable passion and are judging me AT THIS VERY MOMENT.  Therefore: a poll!  (I promise I will not judge you whatever you answer.)Go to the LJ crosspost to vote on your feelings about MUSICALS.If you want to talk about your favorite musical, that also would be welcomed!

Yes, it is an icon post that is not entirely focused around Princess Tutu! I know you are all shocked. (And um you can probably expect one of those in a few days.) Most of these are Capital Scandal icons, which I know none of you have seen, but on the other hand I feel most of you will not blame me too much if I bring you what is basically a small picspam of very pretty people pointing guns, wielding swords, swing-dancing, crossdressing, punching each other in the FACE, and wearing ridiculous plaid suits and pink fedoras, yes? 
( I have learned that in kdrama, threatening to shoot someone means 'I love you'!  Except when it doesn't. )Spurred on by last week's babbling about old movies (and by love of fedoras), I also made some Casablanca icons! And some Scarlet Pimpernel (1983) icons, which I really have no excuse for except that I wanted a swashbuckling icon and Anthony Andrews and baby Ian McKellen make funny faces. ( To be fair, in Casablanca threatening to shoot someone also often means 'I love you', even if that is not explicitly iconed )
