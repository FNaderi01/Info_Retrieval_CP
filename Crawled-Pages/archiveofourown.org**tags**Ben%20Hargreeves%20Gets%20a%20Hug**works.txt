    Summary
      Set on episode 6 of season 2, in the family meeting. Klaus gets possessed by Ben but it turns out a little bit more dramatic than that. Nobody cared when he fell to the floor after what seemed a desperate attempt to gain attention, but they didn't expect for him to start seizing uncontrollably before their paralized gazes.I know, I suck at summaries. :D Hope you like it.

    Summary
      (made for my friend so this is. very self indulgent but if you feel like it you should read it. just for kicks)Klaus let go of Five's hand - and found himself in a whole new timeline where his powers were stronger than ever, but his family - and Dave - are farther than he can ever reach. All he can do is make a new life for himself, and hope they find him eventually. But as tensions rise among the Renegades and Anarchists, will he be able to decide who's really the good guy - and who he will stick with as things start to collapse?Nova doesn't know much about Four, but she can see that his family - wherever they are - didn't take care of him. She's going to protect him the way that she wasn't, no matter the cost to others - or herself.

    Summary
      Some days, Ben hates Klaus.(Just a little.)(Some days, Ben wants to scream and shout and destroy, and his image flickers like static, blood spreading across his clothing in long, bloody ribbons that remind him too much of tentacles emerging from his stomach that tear his hoodie into pieces, and Ben with it, even as he screams, and screams, and screams-)Some days, Ben looks at the rabid ghosts that follow Klaus around.His brother ignores them completely, high on drugs until Klaus’s words start to slur together and he stumbles around with pupils blown wide, unable to even see or hear them.Ben can’t do that. Ben’s insubstantial, a ghost, little more than a hallucination of Klaus’s mind because he can’t interact with anything, talk to anyone, and if Klaus wasn’t there, Ben doesn’t think he would know he was real-(Ben doesn’t like to think about the other ghosts. Not when it’s all too easy to imagine himself as one of them.)Or: Ben gets trapped as a ghost. This is not entirely anyone's fault, but it's hard not to assign blame.
