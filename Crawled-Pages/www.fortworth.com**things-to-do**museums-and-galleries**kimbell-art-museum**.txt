The Kimbell Art Museum is internationally renowned for both its collections and for its architecture. The Kimbell's collections range in period from antiquity to the 20th century and include European masterpieces by Fra Angelico, Michelangelo, Caravaggio, Poussin, Monet, Picasso and Matisse. You can also view important collections of Egyptian and classical antiquities, Asian, Mesoamerican and African art.
The Museum's building, designed by the American architect Louis I. Kahn, is widely regarded as one of the outstanding architectural achievements of the modern era.
A second building, designed by world-renowned Italian architect Renzo Piano opened November 2013 and provides space for special exhibitions, allowing the Kahn building to showcase the permanent collection. During your visit, enjoy the Kimbell Buffet for homemade soups, salads, sandwiches, quiche and desserts. Donâ€™t forget to stop by the Kimbell Art Museum Shop for the perfect Fort Worth souvenir.
