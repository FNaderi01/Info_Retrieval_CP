Student Athlete of the Week: Jason Bell            
				By Amanda Scurlock, Sports Writer                
	                	                Published May 30, 2019
		Sophomore Hurdler Jason Bell maintains a 3.8 GPA (Amanda Scurlock/L.A. Sentinel)
Carson Colts sophomore Jason Bell makes the Colts frosh/soft track and field team a competitive force. His talents led him to compete and excel at the City Section championships.
Bell competed in the 110m hurdles, the 300 hurdles, and the 4×400 relay during the City Championship. He put on his best performance during the 110m, running 17.23s time and taking first place.
Excelling as a hurdler was a process for Bell, learning how to jump over hurdles was once a big challenge for him.
        ADVERTISEMENT        
“When someone first told me I was doing hurdles, I was a little nervous,” Bell said. “But once I did it over and over, I got better at it.”
While finding his comfort in the event, he became a skilled competitor. During the Marine League Finals, Bell ran a 44.92s in the 300m hurdles and won first place. His only competitor during the heat was freshman Fernando Rendon, both he and Rendon run on the Frosh/Soph 4x100m and the 4x400m relay squads. Bell helped get the Marine League title in both events.
Bell has a 3.8 GPA and his favorite class is history. He likes learning about how people of the past accomplished tasks without the use of technology. He noted how he enjoys the spirit and the “Colt love” he feels at the school.
“They keep us going,” Bell said. “They help us and get us better.”
Along with track and field, Bell has experience playing baseball. He applies the lessons learned in track to help him on the baseball diamond.
“When I’m in track, I’m fast,” Bell said. “When I hit the ball in baseball, then I can take off and get to every base and keep my stamina.”
Bell’s advice to young student athletes is to persevere and put forth your best effort when competing.
“Just try your hardest, don’t give up that easy,” Bell said. “Just keep going.”
The L.A. Sentinel is looking for athletes with a strong academic background or currently volunteers to make L.A. a better place. Please contact Amanda Scurlock at amanda@lasentinel.net to nominate your Student Athlete of the Week. Cheerleaders and dance team members also qualify.
