 December 
Teacher Resource Guide
December, the last month of the year, is also the month with the shortest 
days in the northern hemisphere - and the longest ones south of the equator. 
This is the season of snow and frost in the north, chickadees and cardinals 
coming to bird feeders, and all the color and merriment of the Christmas 
season. There are probably more major holidays in this month - many of them 
newly created - than in any other month of the year. Perhaps people feel 
the need to celebrate to cast off the winter gloom and turn the season into 
something magical and pleasant.
Some creatures, however, prefer to sleep through the winter rather than 
party through it. Black bears are snoring by December, with their hearts 
beating only eight times a minute and their furry backs pressed up against 
the den entrance to keep out the cold. However, if someone starts poking 
around in their den, a bear can wake up in anywhere from several minutes 
to a second or two. This is different from other hibernating animals, who 
take longer to wake up. Read More About
