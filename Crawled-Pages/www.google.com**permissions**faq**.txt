                  Google is sponsoring my event. Do I need permission to use the Google logo?
                If you're working with us on an event, please work with your Google contact to obtain permission to use the logo.
                  I'm a Google Grants recipient. Can I publish the Google logo on my site?
                Yes, you may include Google on your in-kind donor list and you may publish our logo on your site. We also have a standard statement that you can use to acknowledge your grant:

                  I'm not a certified partner, but I provide search engine optimization (SEO) and monetization (SEM) services. I'd like to display a number of search engine logos on my site so clients understand which search engines are my expertise. Can I publish the Google logo?
                Unfortunately, since we don't have a way to evaluate your knowledge about Google, we can't allow you to use our logo. However, we encourage you to participate in one of our certification programs. Upon completion, we award you with a Partner badge to place on your site that lets potential customers know that you are in fact a pro with Google products.

                  I'm a Google Certified Partner/Trainer. Can I publish the Google logo on my site?
                If you're a Google Certified Partner of any of our Partner Programs, you may use your GCP badge on your site and other marketing material, but we cannot give you permission to use the Google logo. Please use your badge instead.
                  Can Google sponsor my event or group?
                Google receives lots of requests every day to sponsor many worthy events and initiatives. Unfortunately, Google Brand Permissions is unable to review and provide approval for any sponsorships. If you are working with someone at Google, please connect with them to review sponsorship requests.

                  I found an image on Google Image Search that I want to use. Do I need permission to use it?
                Yes, you do need permission in order to use it. However, Google doesn’t own the images found via Google Search. You must contact the owner of the image (typically whoever first posted the image on the web) and obtain his/her permission in order to use it.
                  I found a video/image/page that I want to use. I know I need permission, but I don't have the contact information for the owner of the page. Can Google look it up and share it with me?
                We can't share user information, as that would be a violation of our privacy agreements with our users. We suggest looking on the site in question for a way to contact the site's webmaster.

                  I’d like to create a tutorial on how to use a Google product. Do I need Google's permission?
                You don't need our permission to use – for instructive or illustrative purposes – a standard, unaltered Google screenshot (an image of our homepage, a main product page, or search results page) in print or digital formats.
However, you must be in compliance with our usage guidelines; and the uses must be unaltered: you can't superimpose graphics, photos, or ad copy on the screenshot or change the look of the screen-captured image in any other way.
Outside of screenshots, you do need to obtain our permission to use the Google logo.
                  I'm writing an academic book that references Google. Can I use the logo on the cover?
                You cannot use the logo on the cover of a publicly-available book or publication without our permission. Please submit a request and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.

                  I'm a developer and used Google's developer products/tools to create a new product. Can I use the Google name?
                We cannot approve any company names or application names that incorporate a Google trademark, or that are confusingly similar to Google's trademarks.
If you state that your product is compatible with a Google product, the product must actually be compatible with that Google product. Any notice that your product is compatible with a Google product should be made in a referential manner using phrases such as “for” or “compatible with” or “for use with.”
If reference is made to a Google trademark in connection with your logo, your logo must be larger than the Google trademark. The first instance of the Google trademark should contain the (™) symbol. Examples: “XYZ software for Android™” or “ABC plug-in for Google Chrome™”.
                  I found a potentially harmful website that’s pretending to be authored by Google, but I'm pretty sure it's fraud and violating your trademarks. How can I report what I saw?
                Thanks for looking out for us. You can let us know about the violation here.
