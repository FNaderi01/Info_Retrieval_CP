                                                            Are we allowed to write a short story that only has one prompt? If so, do I still have to tag every chapter even though the short story only has one prompt?
                                                        Yes, you can write a short story with only one prompt.  No you don’t have to tag every chapter of the story.Thanks for the question!

                                                            I did not know you were reblogging nsfwhump stuff this year so I was. Very shocked scrolling through blog
                                                        Thank you for your comment. We have always reblogged/allowed nsfw content during Whumptober. This year we’ve seen a huge influx in the number of participants  and therefore a big spike in nsfw content as well. This is why we tried to make it clear from the beginning how important tagging is. We don’t have the time to verify that every creation  is tagged properly and trust each participant to be as careful as they can. All non-con, r*pe, and sexually explicit content should be tagged as NSFW. We still recommend blacklisting the trigger tags as well to avoid any content you don’t want to see, nonny. We’re sorry if the some of them slipped through.Tagging System Explained

Here are some helpful hints for your best chance at getting archived:Tag with #whumptober2020, no spaceTag with the prompt number your using (ex. #no.5 if you’re using that theme or any of its alt prompts.)Properly format your trigger warnings: #trigger tw (not tw: trigger or tw trigger)Tag if it’s a #fic, #art, #gifs etc. Tag if it’s Fandom or OC (#oc or #tua, #mcu, etc.)Basically it’s all tags. If you think you’re not showing up in the Whumptober tag, mentioning this blog is fine too.

                                                            With fic, is it okay if I tag for a trigger in the fic's notes instead? There is one particular trigger in my multichap that people might want to avoid, but others would not want to be spoiled on because of how it affects the plot. I'd rather not make it a main tag, just a tag others can click through to see if they know they're particularly sensitive to stuff.
                                                        We would prefer it in the tags if you want your work reblogged here.  I totally understand the dilemma, but we’d rather be safe than sorry.

As we explained previously, the archive is random and not a complete list of every work produced for the eventWe are not affiliated with the whumptober-2020 blog that has popped up. While we totally support side competitions, using the same name as our event is not appreciated and we will not be reblogging content produced for this parallel event. We’re going to start tagging all archived posts with “archive” if you would like to continue following the blog but don’t necessarily want to see all the archived posts on your dash. To avoid confusion with the other event, we recommend using the tag #whumptober2020 without the space.Please read the FAQs before sending us an ask, especially now that the event is running and we’re swamped.All the 2020 Event Info that was pinned to the top of the page is now under the cut below so you don’t have to scroll past that big ol post when you visit.You can also visit our nifty little official Event Info page!Happy Whumping!Keep reading

                                                            How do you want to be tagged or credited if I use the prompts after Whumptober? I made an overly ambitious plan I won't be able to complete in time to be a completionist, but I still want to complete it anyway
                                                        The prompts are free to use any time. There’s no credit/tags after the event.

                                                            For the actual prompts, how do we go about tagging them? Say, for the "2020 bingo card" ideas, if we use specifically the "earthquake" prompt, is that what we tag? Or do we tag the "2020 bingo card" prompt, since that seems to be the main one? Thank you so much for your patience.

                                                        If you’re posting it all on the same day then any way you want. Just use the general order in the FAQs.
