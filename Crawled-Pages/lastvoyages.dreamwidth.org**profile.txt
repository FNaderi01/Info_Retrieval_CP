                 Mini Bio
NO WARNINGS......NO SECOND CHANCES.UNTIL NOW.You are one of two people. The Good or the Bad. On board the barge, you are the Warden, or you are the Inmate.The Barge is a great vessel, borne of the minds of merciful beings from every universe, every timeline, birthed from them all. On deck it appears very much to simply be an immense, luxurious ship, and the waters beneath it are space itself. Looking from the railing, a passenger might catch glimpses of the worlds and events they are passing.It is commanded by the mysterious Admiral -- a figure often spoken of but never seen. The silent force guiding you along your journey, delegating punishments and rewards.Inmates are those very lost souls first mentioned. Presented with the harsh reality of how very near to utter annihalation their souls have come, they are given an option: live as an inmate aboard the barge, endure the trials set before them and learn from them, and be eventually granted a second chance at life. Also among the Inmates are their Wardens, individuals of moral character (in most cases) given the task to look after them, inform them of their duties while in Port, and stand as their moral compass during their time aboard the Barge. These are the sort who have come to the Barge through trade with the Powers That Be as they know them. Perhaps they work in exchange for the return to life of a lost loved one, or an extension on their own life. Perhaps they are former Inmates, who have chosen to spend their new life helping others like them.The Ports are the regular stops the Barge comes to. It is known to stop or merely pass various worlds and times, some familiar and some very strange, some tweaked, some utterly perverted. Those that choose to leave the Barge once it stops may only return to it once they are called back. Retaining their minds, the Inmates must rely upon the information given the Wardens to survive in these worlds, for Death is still a very real thing here, something that may only be undone should their Warden choose to, and succeed at, petitioning the Admiral to have their bodies restored. Those that have the misfortune of falling overboard, however, will not have things so easy...
