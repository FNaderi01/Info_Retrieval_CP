Good news, bad newsOct. 10th, 2020 10:19 am
rachelmanijaBad news: Yesterday while lugging a stack of heavy food books from room to room, I dropped Time-Life Food of the World: America on my left pinkie toe. I am pretty sure I broke or cracked it: it's swollen up so it's as wide as it is long, and the bruising includes a ring of darker bruising around my toe where the probable break is. OW.Better news: I have broken toes before. In fact I may have broken this specific toe before. (I broke my pinkie toe a couple times but don't remember which foot it was.) So there is no need to see a plague-infested doctor who will probably tell me it's all in my head. I will buddy-tape it and/or wear supportive shoes.Good news: The reason I was hauling around those books was to do some final research on a novelette, Watercat Cafe. It was inspired by this Original Works prompt from, IIRC, Femslash Ex: Wounded Stranger/Owner of Post-Apocalyptic Cafe. The novelette is DONE and you will be able to read it shortly.Best news: The novelette is for Her Magical Pet, an anthology about women in love... and their magical pets!. Along with its companion collection, His Magical Pet, all profits will be donated to OutRight Action International. Both collections will be released on October 15. His Magical Pet features stories by Tate Hallaway (Lyda Morehouse), Aster Glenn Gray, and Liv Rider.Her Magical Pet features stories by Yoon Ha Lee, Zoe Chant, and a new Liavek novelette by Pamela Dean. All stories are original to the collections.

Many a tale...Oct. 10th, 2020 02:38 pm
selenakThe Yuletide 2020 Fandoms tagset is up, and I'm eagerly browsing, after being pleased as punch Team Fredericians scored again, our Enlightenment/Circle of Voltaire nominations were also accepted, and someone other than me brought in more Watchmen (TV)  nominations, which means more characters to request. Now due to those 18th Century Prussians I'm invested in, I checked out the RPF section first.  Since the  decade or so I've been following Yuletide, I've seen present day English politicians nominated repeatedly, but this Yuletide, someone put up four Germans. Among them Marcus Söder. Clearly Nockherberg-Fans. I doubt, though, that anything will be able to match this publicly broadcast RPF of El Marco. I'm also tickled that there's nominated Middle High German Minnesänger RPF, under the subsection "Music and Bands".  Bring on the Walther von der Vogelweide/Reinmar feud, say I.  In the tv section, I experienced nostalgia though the fandoms in question are just a few years old, to wit, The Americans and Bates Motel. I also saw a lot of fandoms where I mentally go "won't offer and likely not request, but do hope someone else writes in it!", including some I only come across recently, like Harlots. Of the novels, I hope someone will tackle The Hunchback of Notre Dame, because the book characterisation is so different from just about all film versions I've seen, and also, yay for an Oracle Glass nomination, that's probably my favourite Judith Merkle Riley novel. I see Rumpelstilzchen the fairy tale got nominated and shall be interested to find out whether it's possible to do something to rival Once Upon A Time's Cora for the Miller's daughter in my heart. In other news, via elisi: Watch on YouTubeI have mixed feelings.  I mean, I could not watch this show until the Dubya years were coming to an end because I felt then that the difference between reality and fiction was too great. Now? The difference is so big that the fiction could take place on another planet. And surely, a reality where The West Wing has taken place (where there is no Tea Party, and Republicans in Congress are largely minded to work with Democrats when it comes to creating laws), the current state of the US would not have happened.  Also, of course, The West Wing has its flaws that have nothing to do with who's currently President.  But then again: the cast is endearing, and good lord I'm in the market for idealism and calls to act on it. What's more, the trailer promises me Jed and Toby scenes. These two characters in the same room, argueing (or, rarely, just talking) were my favourite aspect of the show, and my big unwritten story in this fandom would still be an aftermath for them where Toby is so irritated about his pardon that he drives to New Hampshire to have it out with the (ex) President and they get snowed in so he really has to stay and can't storm off, and they're forced to talk it out. (Not being able to write it, I wrote this instead.) So: cautiously looking forward to it.

Poet and didn't know itOct. 10th, 2020 10:24 am
nineveh_ukAccording to the British haiku society, an organisation whose website appears to indicate that their only association with the word 'joy' is that it is one syllable, a haiku 'should derive from spontaneous, concrete, personal experience in a certain moment of heightened awareness'. In that sense, the following certainly qualifies...Holy fuck!Through the train windowThe Eiger's north face.Actually, I think I said 'Fucking hell!', and I can't be bothered to find the volume of my diary to check if I ever wrote it down, but 'Holy fuck! scans better. It is in any case one of the most extraordinary sights in nature that I have ever seen. It bursts out of the scenery in a way that the above pic, which I have not managed to re-size, bursts out of the flist.

muccamukkPosted over at heavyartillery: Potential Queer History Resources, an Incomplete List, which is basically books and documentary films I've found useful researching for BoB/TP/Marvel fandoms. So it's pretty... focused, if you're not writing about white cis dudes. Anyway.I need to do something like that but with all the random online crap I've found over the years. I have a bad habit of reading something, assimilating the information, then forgetting where I saw it or what it was called.

I did a vid!Oct. 9th, 2020 10:04 pm
nayeIt's been so long since I posted anything I've kind of forgotten how to do announcements?! Anyway - I did a TLTR vid!! Here's how I advertised it on Twitter:🎵3:12 minutes of pure silliness💖Also lots of Iron Triangle💙And of course Liu Sang🦀Starring HANDCRABS and MURDER CLAMS🔥Featuring three topless scenesCome get the party started!Note that it's got scenes from the entire show, so if you're avoiding any and all spoilers wait to watch it until you've seen every episode. (The clips go by very quickly and the vid doesn't have anything like a plot, so if visuals are fine by all means go for it.)

A few quick fandom thingsOct. 8th, 2020 08:47 pm
sholioI got to read my Marvel Trumps Hate fic from scioscribe today and it is AMAAAAAZING; it's everything I asked for and a whole lot more. I cannot WAIT 'til it's up on AO3 so I can link to it properly. I am awash in happy feelings.(And yes, I still owe two Equality Auction fics! They are next up on my list of things to write.)holly_poly is running again! Currently open for tag nominations - tag set here, and requested formatting for large fandoms here. (For this exchange, MCU movies and shows should all go under Marvel Cinematic Universe; Torchwood goes under Doctor Who.) Original nominations and crossovers are also allowed.fixedthatforyou_fest has their list of prompts up. Formal prompt claiming isn't necessary; just pick a prompt and write! AO3 collection here. (Posting opens Nov. 14.)Do you think it would be inappropriate to ask the mod if they might open the collection early but keep it unrevealed until the posting dates? I would love to see what people are writing about!trickortreatex is currently ongoing - here's the list of requests for potential treating purposes!Also, a quick reminder that recthething has a weekly open reccing post in case you just want to drop one or two recs and don't want to make a post to the entire community.

skygiantsWe have just finished all sixty episodes of the cdrama Oh My General! Would I actually recommend watching all sixty episodes of Oh My General? I think that depends on how much you require your 'plot' to be 'good' .... Okay, so the starting plot of Oh My General is essentially: "After Mulan led her armies to victory and revealed her gender, what happened next? ... a rom-com!" Triumphant general Ye Zhao, the Living God of Hell, has been living as a man for decades after the death of the rest of her warrior family; now, having saved the Empire but deceived the Emperor in the process, she's technically liable for the death penalty. Instead, the Emperor lets her keep her job and appoints her as his advisor, but also decides to marry her off to his most beautiful but useless fop of a nephew, thus rewarding her for her accomplishments and tying her to the royal family in one fell swoop. Who could possibly complain? Not Ye Zhao, actually, who is cheerfully thrilled by the prospect of being matched with some adorable arm candy with whom she may or may not have a secret childhood backstory that only she knows about. ( Cut for many more images )

muccamukk1. Check the fandom tag. There's more new fic than I can keep up with. I'll try to catch up and do recs soon, meanwhile much goodness needs comments.2. Got my HA Holiday Exchange assignment today, and it's probably doable. Don't have a firm idea yet.3. I put up a poll about a potential BoB Rewatch, if anyone's interested.

muccamukkWhat I Just Finished ReadingThis One Looks Like a Boy: My Gender Journey to Life as a Man by Lorimer ShenherMemoirs of a trans guy who grew up in a similar enough setting to my dad that I asked Dad if he knew him (no, but knew his dad), which was slightly trippy. A lot of the book is about dysphoria, shame and guilt, as one would somewhat expect growing up trans and Catholic in Alberta in the 1960s (not great, Skippy). For all that, it didn't feel like a complete downer? I liked how hard Shenher was trying, and how he kept letting himself be vulnerable, and keeping the possibility of hope open. Though admittedly is was heartwrenching to read how often he'd feel just on the verge of transitioning, and then not do it. For decades.Shenher is mostly known in Canada for being the lead detective on what turned into the worst serial killer case in Canadian history, and though the book deals with his police work, and his frustration at the failures of policing (especially in regards to marginalised communities), it doesn't deal heavily with the gory details.Out North: An Archive of Queer Activism and Kinship in Canada, edited by Craig Jennex &amp; Nisha EswaranBeautiful coffee table book full of the pictures, documents and ephemera collected by the Arquives in Toronto, which is I believe the country's largest queer archive. The layout is roughly by decade, with a text section setting up that period in Canadian history, more or less starting in WWII, and moving forward to the present day, followed by pages or page spreads on different parts of the collection relevant to that period. As a history, it's not that comprehensive, but I love the life and details, the little bits of queers like kudzu hanging in there and fighting back, rebuilding broken communities, and mixing rage and humour and disco. It's nice seeing our fingerprints all over history.The editors are keen to emphasise that this is not the history of queer Canada, but a history, and admit that it's more white, male and Toronto than they'd like, and that the story they're telling isn't one of a march towards progress, but of continual work, renegotiation, and celebration and loss. I liked it, am getting a couple things from their excellent further reading section at the back, have already read a few.An Excerpt:The Brunswick FourOn January 5, 1974, Adrienne Potts, Pat Murphy, Sue Wells, and Heather Byers took to the stage of the Brunswick tavern in downtown Toronto to perform "I Enjoy Being a Dyke" (a rendition of the classic show tune "I Enjoy Being a Girl").I've always been an uppity womanI don't run I stand and fight'Cause I'm gay and I'm proud and I'm angryI enjoy being a dyke!When I see a man who's sexistAnd he does something I don't likeI can tell him that he can fuck offI enjoy being a dyke!I don't dress up cute and frillyAnd in clothing I don't likeI just go in my jeans and stompersI enjoy being a dyke!After the inevitable arrest (the largely straight male audience responded warmly, the bar's manager called the cops, reporting a "lesbian riot"), the women reported being beaten up, and receiving verbal taunts such as, "I bet you drive a tugboat."What I'm Reading NowAudio: The Old Drift by Namwali Serpell, narrated by Adjoa Andoh, Richard E. Grant &amp; Kobna Holdbrook-Smith. I'm probably about two-thirds through this. The book follows three families, started in 1904, and is now up to 2007, and I have to admit that I'm barely holding on in regards to who is related to whom. So far, there's a lot of magical realism, and no science fiction to speak of, but the Clarke does tend to go a lot more literary fiction than my taste. The narrator is a joy and a pleasure.Library: A Reconciliation Without Recollection? An Investigation of the Foundations of Aboriginal Law in Canada by Joshua Ben David Nichols. I'm reading like three pages of this a day. He's now onto the importance of the writing of JS Mill in the formulation of the Indian Act. I'm kinda following along? About a quarter through, I think.Ebook: Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft, addressed to J.G. Lockhart, ESQ. by Sir Walter Scott. For fic research. If I skip over every time he's being racist or a blowhard or a racist blowhard, it goes pretty fast, but amount of useful information found so far is also pretty low. Probably would have helped when I was writing that fic about the fey in Bastogne, but number of actual demons so far approaches zero.What I'm Reading NextAudio: I keep meaning to read the new NK Jemisin book, so maybe that?  Library: I made the mistake of lending someone a couple incoming library books as she doesn't have a card yet, not realising that she's a very slow reader, and now I'm in the awkward manners place of having read all my other library books, but not really being able to ask for them back. I do hope to someday read the biography of Captain Goddard I saw go by. Otherwise may be forced to read something I actually own.

osprey_archerWhat I’ve Just Finished ReadingWilliam Braxton Irvine published The Stoic Challenge: A Philosopher’s Guide to Becoming Tougher, Calmer, and More Resilient in 2019, but nonetheless it seems tailor-made for 2020, the year that pulls the rug out from under your feet again and again. The book is about how to deal with unexpected setbacks: view them as a challenge, he suggests; this is of course much easier to do with smaller setbacks, although the ancient Roman stoics were famous for applying it in situations like “exile” and “being ordered to commit suicide by the Senate.” It’s also about how to appreciate what you have: imagine what it would be like not to have it, and, well, lucky us! in 2020, you don’t even need to exercise your imagination on this one. If there’s one thing Americans have all experienced this year, it’s suddenly not having things we always expected to have. Movie theaters, restaurants, food and toilet paper on the grocery shelves, being able to see people’s faces, the expectation of a peaceful transition of power after the election in November… It’s all unpleasant, of course, but I remind myself that historically speaking, we are really only paddling in the shallows of just how bad things can get, as evidenced (in this week's reading) by Alex Halberstadt’s Young Heroes of the Soviet Union, which has a whole section on his maternal grandparents’ experiences escaping the Holocaust as Lithuanian Jews. I actually got the book because I was interested in Halberstadt’s experience growing up gay in the Soviet Union. But in actual fact his family left the USSR when he was still a child, so there’s not too much for him to say about it; the most interesting tidbit is that he had his first sexual awakening looking at the illustrations in the textbook Young Heroes of the Soviet Union, a sort of Soviet martyrology of young people dying heroic, gruesome, patriotic deaths. (I imagined this sexually awakened MANY Soviet youths, of all sexual orientations.) I also learned from this book that in Russian, chanterelles are lisichki, little foxes, which would have been ADORABLE in Honeytrap, oh my God. Maybe I should stop reading about the Soviet Union for a bit. I seem to have this “that would have been AMAZING to include in Honeytrap” reaction to at least one tidbit from every book. What I’m Reading NowContinuing on in Jeannette Ng’s Under the Pendulum Sun. I’m enjoying the worldbuilding, particularly the imaginary Victorian theology of the fae (do they have souls or don’t they?), but boy, it would’ve been nice if the incest had been mentioned a little bit in the blurb. I suppose whoever wrote it must have thought comparing the book to Crimson Peak counted as due diligence?  I’m also working on Sally Belfrage’s Freedom Summer and of course Mary Renault’s The Charioteer, but I’m going to write full reviews for both of them once I’m done, so I won’t take up space talking about them here. (Oh, well, fine, for the Charioteer contingent, I will mention that I got to the part ( Spoilers ))Another quote from Nadezhda Mandelstam’s Hope against Hope: The true believers were not only sure of their own triumph, they also thought they were bringing happiness to the rest of mankind as well, and their view of the world had such a sweeping, unitary quality that it was very seductive. In the pre-revolutionary era there had already been this craving for an all-embracing idea which would explain everything in the world and bring about universal harmony in one go. That is why people so willingly closed their eyes and followed their leader, not allowing themselves to compare words to deeds, or to weigh the consequences of their action. This explained the progressive loss of a sense of reality - which had to be regained before there could be any question of discovering what had been wrong with the theory in the first place.What I Plan to Read NextI’ve had Robert Louis Stevenson’s Catriona (called David Balfour in the United States; the lesser-known sequel to Kidnapped!) lying around for weeks and I really ought to just read it.

A Declaration of the Rights of Magicians - H.G. ParryOct. 7th, 2020 08:07 am
troisoiseauxInteresting premise – an alternate history of the Enlightenment era/French and Haitian revolutions, ft. magic – and I liked the author's writing style, but unfortunately, my feelings on the book as a whole were mostly "deeply annoyed." I was charmed by the friendship dynamic of William Pitt the Younger and William Wilberforce, entirely because I had absolutely no prior knowledge about either of them other than the fact that Pitt was a person who existed. (I had to Google whether the same was true of Wilberforce.) I was not a fan of the French Revolution storyline for precisely the same (opposite?) reason— I was obsessed with that period of history in 8th-9th grade, and have a lot of prior knowledge about those events and historical figures. The Haitian revolution storyline had the benefit of being told through the POV of an original character, but I had some other issues with it I'll get into under the cut.( Spoilers )

TV habitsOct. 7th, 2020 10:00 am
nayeI am seeing so many recs for shows that look interesting, and it's bumming me out that I have such a hard time starting new shows. Not because I think I won't like them, but there's just...no time? Or something?And by that I mean: as of TLTR, I've finished half a dozen new shows this year. That's it. It's October and I've watched six new shows. (Seven, if you want to be generous and include Shahai which I watched while feverish and fastforwarding. But given my feelings on Shahai I don't really want to be generous.)I have watched more TV overall! I'm not counting documentaries in this, as they hit a completely different spot and I did binge on them when I was sick. I've also watched new seasons of shows I've been following for years as well as rewatched some old favorites. (2020 is a good year for comfort watching.) So there's been more TV time overall than if I'd only watched ~110 hours of television of anything all the way through this year. Plus I've picked up and then dropped four new shows. So I'm also really picky about my TV, despite the fact that I fall headlong for shows of dubious quality. ^^;The worst part is that I'm not even reading (books or fic) to fill the time! It's just that either I or Skuld usually want to focus on creative projects (though I haven't written in months now), so we rarely watch more than an episode a night. And it's much more fun to watch things with Skuld than alone! So I almost never start anything they're not also going to watch. But then I'm sitting here with a growing list of shows other like that I think I would like too but when to watch?? And I get the FOMO and feel like I have nothing to add to any of my friends' conversations, or I get spoiled for shows in ways that makes me give up on ever watching them (hi Untamed).And yes this entry is probably brought to you by October Blues + 2020 ganging up on me. But I feel like I owe everyone who's recommended awesome-looking shows to me an apology for expressing enthusiasm and then never watching any of them. ^^;;;(For the curious, the new shows I've watched all the way through without fastforwarding this year are: Sarazanmai, Run With The Wind, The Babysitters Club, The King's Avatar, Legend of the Condor Heroes and TLTR. And this is my total media intake.)

skygiantsMicah Nemerever's These Violent Delights is a really fantastic entry into the rich genre of homoerotic thrillers about subsuming one's identity into an intense and destructive relationship; it's also, very relevantly to me, not only an extremely queer book but an extremely Jewish book, with a deep undercurrent of diaspora culture and generational trauma running through the text.The plot: it's the 1970s in Pittsburgh, and seventeen-year-old Paul Fleischer's working-class Jewish family is still in mourning for his father -- a weight of stifling emotion that Paul desperately wants to escape. Then Paul meets college classmate Julian Fromme, brilliant and vicious and wriggling furiously on the hook of his very different family's very different expectations for him. Pretty soon, the two of them are inseparable, which is where the hard part begins, but not, of course, where it ends. Julian and Paul's mutual obsession makes both their families very uncomfortable, for some bad reasons (it is the 1970s and everyone Knows what is going on but they do NOT want to say it), but also some very good ones! These bright and disaffected kids are eventually going to do a murder and it's going to be bad; the book tells you this at the beginning. It's not a secret. The book is about how we get there, and how Paul and Julian transform each other along the way, in large part by staring deeply into each other's eyes and trying really hard to become the person they think they see in the reflection without stopping to check their perceptions against reality. And a major element of that self-idealization -- for Paul, at least, our POV character for almost all of the book -- is the struggle to be better than the world in which he finds himself: a world just one generation past the Holocaust, a world of Nietzsche and My Lai and the Milgram Experiment, in which it seems impossible to believe that any human being doesn't carry the seeds of, not just evil, but banal evil inside of them. This book has been pretty frequently compared to The Secret History, and for good reason, but the thing that sets this apart from that, for me, is the specificity of the place and time and circumstances that shape Paul and Julian into what they become. The Secret History is a brilliant book, but I absolutely could not tell you in what decade it takes place; I genuinely think it changes scene to scene. Richard's family doesn't matter, Henry's background doesn't matter, what matters is the all-consuming environment of the college and the claustrophobia of the relations among the kids. In These Violent Delights, on the other hand, it matters tremendously that Paul's grandparents were socialists, that Julian's father conceals his Jewishness, that Paul's mother and sisters are slowly working their way out of grief even as Paul is twisting further and further inwards.I don't want to say, like, 'if you like gay books with murder, give this a go,'although it is absolutely a gay book with murder, because I feel like that gives an impression of lightness that's a little misleading. But if you like thoughtful and extremely well-done character/relationship studies with some gay murder in them, and up for feeling a lingering sense of uncomfortably haunted claustrophobia long after the close of the book, I would strongly recommend.

This Morning I Got Death Threats From a TrumperOct. 6th, 2020 11:36 am
rachelmanijaWhile gardening, no less!Don't worry, he doesn't know where I live. I wasn't at home, I was doing some work elsewhere in the neighborhood in a fenced-in lot.So there I was, peacefully pulling weeds, when a white guy walked past with a kid I assume was his son, neither wearing masks. They looked like a totally normal white suburban family (which as we all know from horror movies, means I should have run for my life.) The kid looked about four years old and was on a scooter. Just as they were passing me, the kid took a tumble. I looked up and said, "Are you all right?"The kid picked himself up, the dude looked at me, and then he said in a hostile tone, "That's a Marxist organization! They're Marxists! Do you know that?!"That seemed like a total non sequitur, so I said, "What?""Black Lives Matter! They're Marxists!"It was then that I remembered that I was wearing a BLM mask. And also, taking a closer look, I saw that he was wearing a TRUMP 2020 baseball cap.I was not really prepared for a political debate, so I just said, "No, they're not.""Yes, they are!"I didn't see much point in continuing the debate, so I said, "Well, I disagree."He walked closer, I waved him back, he didn't move, so I got up and backed up. I was inside a locked lot and he was outside, with a chain-link fence between us, so I was worried about him breathing on me, not attacking me. "It's not a matter of agree or disagree!" he yelled. "It's facts! It's on the Black Lives Matter website that they're Marxists!""No, it isn't," I said."Yes, it is!""No, it isn't," I said. "That's just not correct.""Just you wait," he said. "The squatties will all get their necks squeezed."He didn't yell, but said that in a kind of gleeful tone. It was extremely creepy. His kid was just standing there with his little scooter the whole time, watching.I had no idea what a squatty was, but figured it was some Q-Anon or white supremacist derogatory term. When I'm hearing death threats I like to know specifically why I'm being threatened, so I said, "I don't know what that word means.""Squatty, squatty," he said. "You know.""No. I've never heard that before." "The bald lady, you know... they'll all be strung up, all the Marxists! It's on the Black Lives Matter website that they're Marxists!""No, it isn't," I said, belatedly realizing that he meant "the squad" in Congress. "I believe in justice and equality for all. Listen, you should join, see for yourself..."He gave a loud, maniacal laugh - seriously, it was a HA HA HA HA - and said, "When you try to take over the country, I'll be there to stop you!"I said, "Listen, I have work to do. You have a nice day.""You're Marxists! Marxists!" He stomped off with his kid, belatedly yelling, rather aggressively, "You have a nice day too."That is the first time I've ever gotten a death threat as an adult from someone who was not having an obvious psychotic episode. In broad daylight, in a public place, in front of his child. I have to say that it was pretty disturbing.(Yes, yes, technically he was threatening the Congresswomen, not me directly, but he certainly seemed to be implying that I should also be killed.)

melannenI didn't post about this at the time because I figured I was the only person who was laggard enough to have the problem, but apparently there are more of us than I thought, and not all of us were annoyed enough to figure out how to fix it?So, if cut tags on your journal have been broken since the summer, so that they no longer open in the page and you have to open in a new page, it is probably because you are still using a Core1 journal style you imported from LJ. When they made some updates to DW backend code recently, they accidentally broke javascript for Core1, which for most people mostly means the magic cut tags. (It probably also messes with expanding comment threads if you read comment pages in your style? I use site scheme there so idk.)This is not something I will blame DW for, because Core1 styles were obsolete ten years ago when DW was founded and mostly have never met basic web accessibility standards, and it is frankly impressive they still support them at all. (Why are you still using Core1 on your journal, you deadbeat*?? Has "update journal style" really been on your todo list for MORE THAN TEN YEARS???)Anyway, they are hopefully going to fix it in the next code push eventually. Meanwhile, there are two options: you can go to Change Style and pick a style that was coded this millennium. This fixes it for everyone, and also means you are using a style that follows at least some web standards.Or you can do what I did, stick stubbornly to your horrible ancient style that you've been using more than half your life, and go to the beta page and select "Turn ON beta testing" for "Temporarily revert updated journal page components" (I know it's counterintuitive to turn ON beta testing in order to turn OFF new features, but it's a workaround.) This will only fix it for you while you are logged in - other visitors to your journal in your style will still have broken cut tags. Then add dw_maintenance to your reading list, so you'll know when it's fixed and you can turn it back off.*also why is your style still Homestuck themed, what is wrong with you

The Personal History of David Copperfield (Film Review)Oct. 6th, 2020 05:05 pm
selenakThis was the first movie I saw in the cinema since February, and I've been curious about it for a year now. It's, as advertised, a breathless, fast paced, wildly inventive version of David Copperfield, directed by Armado Ianucci, with a great cast multiethnic cast (colourblind in the British stage sense, hence, for example, Nikki Amuka-Bird as Mrs. Steerforth - who in this version is an amalgan of herself and Rosa Dartle -  and Aneurin Barnard as her son).  ( The hero of his own life? )
