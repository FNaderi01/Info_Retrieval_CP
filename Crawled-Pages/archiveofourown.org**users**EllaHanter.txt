    Summary
  Once upon a time there was four very sad boys who gained joy in helping others and each other.
   First to join was the powerless knight, he was tie that binded them.   Next came the prince of a kingdom he did not want to inherit, he made the foundation of what they were.   Then came the mage shunned by society, he built the grounds of who they should be to others.   Finally was the palidain that no one saw use in, he was the one to give them their ideals.   The four forged a guild of renegades that saved those who needed it.   They became The Lost Boys.  Aizawa had finally cornered the vigilantes that had been giving him and the police so much trouble... He just didn't expect it to be a bunch of homeless eleven year olds. Vigilante Midoriya, Todoroki, Shinsou, and Kirishima!

    Summary
    The group faced each other as they formed a circle, fists held out in the center. Midoriya's eyes lit up as he spoke. “The future is…?”
    “Looking pretty damn bleak.” Everyone replied, simultaneously completing the group fist bump as they answered.
Midoriya Izuku laid dying, the mutilated corpses of his fellow survivors-turned-family scattered around him. This was an inevitable outcome really. Yet, that didn’t stop Midoriya from forming one last wish.... A wish that left him and several others awakening within the past, years before the tragedy. And that’s not the only thing that’s changed... Regardless, they were going to prevent the future they perished in and they’ll do it together. Even if that means they’ll stir up some chaos in the process…—In which Midoriya and his survivor family lived within an apocalyptic future. When they finally met their inevitable ends, they find themselves being gifted a chance to go back and change it all. Now, a reset society has eight people with new mysterious abilities who are meant to save the world. 
  … Uh, oh.

    Summary
      Midoriya Izuku lets secrets dangle like threads from his throat, clinging the edges in tired hands. He's lived like this for years. Protecting himself. Keeping himself safe. Never letting the words he wants to say come out. He's tired. He's so, so tired. He lets his secrets-Slip. (They crack against the floor, just a broken reflection of somebody he might have once been.)

    Summary
      Izuku faked his quirk, his past, and his (lack of) criminal activity. He has a little sister he stole, a skeletal mentor who believes in him, and friends he lies to every day.(Izuku has several identities. He isn't sure which one will win out.)
