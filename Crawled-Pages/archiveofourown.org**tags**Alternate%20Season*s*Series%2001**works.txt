    Summary
      Zuko was not a firebending prodigy like Azula, but he was a prodigy nonetheless. After Ursa left, Zuko embraced his skill at alchemy and was all but raised by wise men and women who taught him what years in the palace had not. Critical thinking.When this newly developed skill leaves him burned, banished, and sent to capture the Avatar, Zuko took it as an opportunity to advance his studies. Then everything changed when the Avatar returned. And a stupidly handsome, or maybe just stupid, water tribe boy was left behind when the Avatar escaped.

    Summary
      Though he doesn’t particularly like the beta, for many reasons, sleeping with Dr. Hannibal Lecter had seemed like a good idea to Will at the time - not least of all that doing so prevented Lecter from ethically providing analysis of him to the FBI.But then, somehow, it seems that Hannibal can actually understand the way Will thinks, and that, in a world of madness, gore and shockingly beautiful murder, Will might have actually found a true friend. Whom he is still painfully attracted to despite all their differences, despite society and everyone telling them they’re unsuited for each other, and who still seems to be deeply attracted to him.Discovering he’s pregnant just complicates matters, because that’s just what Will needs when he’s already got murderers to catch, a demanding boss to appease, a surrogate daughter to defend and a brain on fire. Complications.[A Season 1 AU: loosely follows events after Apéritif, with a large omegaverse jump to the left.]

    Summary
      It was completely fine that Jon was following up on this very normal, non-supernatural statement at midnight on a Friday. He was going to find nothing at all, and then he was going to go home and sleep for fourteen straight hours and feel absolutely no qualms about moving case #0150409 directly into the filing cabinet marked "discredited". Or; Jon and Martin end up investigating Carlos Vittery's basement and finding the entity formerly known as Jane Prentiss together.

    Summary
      Stiles thinks about what he learnt.Derek arrived the morning after Laura had been partly found, Stiles and Scott had just ran into him on his first day back, so unless there is some other werewolf in town then the only other werewolf in Beacon Hills at the time of Laura's death was Peter.Stiles thinks part of Derek knows the only suspect is his uncle, but he can't face it and really Stiles doesn't blame him.But someone has to face it, someone has to confront him because people are dying, the Argent's are hunting, and his dad is in the middle of it all.It's that that makes Stiles speed over to where Peter's being kept instead of the ruin that Derek calls home and beg the older and scary man for forgiveness.It's stupid, it's reckless, but Stiles has to do this now.

    Summary
      It took him a second to realise what had happened; what had felt like hours while travelling through the rift shrunk itself in his head to a mere instant of searing gold. That’s when the flicker of the fire in front of him finally registered through his confused daze. In his haste to get away from the flames around him, he slipped and fell, scrambling back until he was a safe distance away from the smoke and the heat. It was only then that he took notice of the voices behind him. He turned towards the noise of a deep, northern voice spluttering and saying, confused and almost angry:“Who the hell are you?”The man rolled over onto his knees and stood up, looking around like he’d never seen a street before. “Jones.” He sounded uncertain but then spoke again with more confidence. “Ianto Jones.”

    Summary
      It’s the most excited he’s been in ages.Peeking behind the curtain which hangs between the FBI and the general public alone would have been the highlight of his time in the States. Even before taking into account the fascinating alpha he had the pleasure to know, and everything that had followed and led up to the climactic finish at the Hobbs home.The mother: splayed out on the front porch and drowned in her own blood; a mere preview of the bloodbath within. The father: slumped against the kitchen cabinets in the corner, his body riddled with far more bullet holes than was strictly necessary to end his reign of terror. The daughter: a loving imitation of her mother, kept alive only by the unsteady hand on her throat. And finally, the owner of that hand: Will Graham himself, drenched in blood spatter and trembling like a leaf as he fumbles to keep the daughter’s neck wound closed.It's like a living, breathing painting; one Hannibal intends on preserving in the foyer of his mind palace for years to come.

    Summary
      Kady’s eyes are hard, cold, and sad. They’re darting around from Julia to anywhere else, almost as if it hurts to look at her. Julia’s heart clenches—is this where they’re at now? Unable to even make eye contact?“What else could you possibly have to say to me?” Kady asks, each word razor sharp, with edges to cut.Julia stands in front of Kady, moonlight streaming down on them as the party rages in the cottage behind them. It was almost exactly here, Julia thinks, that they had first met each other. The first time Kady had amazed her with her with magic that was as powerful and dynamic as she was, and knocked Julia completely off the garden path. Julia had just been too stupid to realize that she was never meant to follow the road most traveled.Julia takes one more step closer to Kady. She’s beautiful like this—wielding a ferocious devastation like a weapon. Even though it’s all directed at Julia, she takes Julia’s breath away.Determination and love swelling up inside her, Julia breathes out, “So much.”

    Summary
      "You need to go off the garden path." - Jane Chatwin"The bridge between your past self and your present self is delicate. If you break it…" - Alice QuinnAfter forty timeloops, one little shift caused by Quentin's timeshare spell was enough to create a splinter timeline - Timeline 41. In Timeline 41, Martin's undercover plan gets a little delayed, and relationships of all kinds shift and change. As for Quentin? That garden path is diverging under his feet, even before he gets a little help from elsewhere.Part of a series but can be mostly read as a standalone.

    Summary
      There are so many ways they’ve gotten lucky within these twenty-four hours (probably less) or so. There’s finding Keith, escaping the Garrison, finding the Lion-spaceship, having the materials to make the Lion-spaceship-finder, amputating Shiro in time for him not to be affected by the virus (they think), have they mentioned finding the Lion-spaceship yet? Because that definitely should count-What’s one more thing? Also, quick question, asking for a friend: What are the odds that the random planet you land on has a breathable-by-humans atmosphere and also houses a giant, clearly alien castle that seems to be your newly found Lion-spaceship’s home?(aka, zombie apocalypse au part 4: this is where it becomes less zombie-apocalypse-y because they kinda. aren’t on earth anymore. also it is taking an incredibly long amount of time to even get past s1e1, why is it taking so long-)

    Summary
      Riverdale came from Greendale. That's something everyone learns in seventh grade civics. After the Trials in 1692, the Order of Innocents—the Brotherhood of Hunters—settled across the Sweetwater to keep watch on the town of Greendale. There they stayed, centuries before Riverdale was ever founded, to wait for the witches to re-emerge. It's an old legend, now. A story. All stories come from something real.  And Betty Cooper's almost sixteen.--XX: A Waste of Wicked Life. Betty and Hilda talk. Jughead and Zelda snipe. Things are happening at Thornhill, though perhaps no one is sure what they mean.--   7th Bughead Fanfiction Awards -- WINNER -- MULTI OVERALL WIP / MULTI FANTASY/SCI-FI7th Bughead Fanfiction Awards -- NOMINEE -- NEWBIE AUTHOR / CREATIVE AUTHOR
