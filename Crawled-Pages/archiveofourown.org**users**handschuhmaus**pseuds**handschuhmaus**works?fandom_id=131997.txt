    Summary
      "bruh, there was this woman. this hardcore gangster woman. she fuckin wronged me, man. like, just totally destroyed me as a person. this fuckin heartless woman. i used to be a good person but now i’m bad and it’s all a woman’s fault." -Palpatine in Ellen's rephrasing of a description of Star Wars: Underworld  But the heartless, uninterested woman here might as well be Nastasya Filipovna, and the callow redhead straight from the reannual vineyards of the hills of Switzerland Naboo cannot help but see her fate plainly. Sadly he cannot see his own...(a fusion of Darth Plagueis, The Idiot, and Mort because Darth Plagueis IS the Reaper Man, if you ask Ellen)

    Creator Chose Not To Use Archive WarningsSheev Palpatine | Darth Sidious Hego Damask | Darth Plagueis Dooku | Darth Tyranus Grievous | Qymaen jai SheelalCrack complete and utter crack strange and random combination of ttrpg and a MUD or that sort of old heavily text based game anyway contemplating idiotic and frivolous actions the hot tub is filled with 300 gallons of dark chocolate liqueur Virtual Reality the Cone of Silence Sith D&amp;D that is Sith playing a ttrpg not Sith as done by the GoT showrunners Role-Playing Game but it's also virtual reality via holonet not ala holodeck though my experience with DMing is largely limited to listening to Griffin McElroy do it
    Summary
      Anakin tries to... well, the closest thing is DM for his friend's online group. It is rather more chaotic than anyone would expect...

    Summary
      Esme Weatherwax (and Mustrum Ridcully) takes on the fundamental functioning of the universe. And the silly prejudices of the other people trying to learn about it.

      Plagueis and Sideous do it with a bit of blood and some pieces of wood. It's about the most fun you can have with those particular items, really. Some other people, though...
