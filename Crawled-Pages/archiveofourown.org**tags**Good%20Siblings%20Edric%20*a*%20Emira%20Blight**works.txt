    Summary
      Luz doesn't always have the best luck when it comes to getting caught up in things on the Boiling Isles or even back on Earth. Thankfully she has an array of family and friends to fall back on when her luck keeps running out.Basically 31 days of primarily Luz based whump.Tags will be updated as I go. Warnings may or may not change. I haven't written all prompts yet so that's unclear.

    Summary
      In another world, in another life, Luz was born in the Isles. In that world, Luz was adopted by Eda, and taken in. In that world, she became quickly became a powerful witch under her adopted mom’s guidance and teaching.In that world, in that life, Amity Blight was born under two twins, under the family name, under the pressure of being the heiress to her father’s company, molded into a machine from her mother, and suffered under expectations created from the feats of her siblings. In that world, she would have to leave the world of fantasies of childlike wonder of her childhood behind, barely fourteen, and grow up into an independent woman of stature and grace. She was supposed to go and study abroad, live up north in the snows for 3 months to a year, depending on how soon Odalia Blight wanted her pawn back. She would go with her two siblings, already their third year attending, and use that time there to make friends and establish relations with children around her same age with the same status.She wasn’t suppose to enter a world known as the Boiling isles, where witches were born and raised.She wasn’t suppose to meet Luz.(Swap AU)

      Being the top student was not easy, and Amity Blight was no exception. Being the daughter her parents ask for was harder, especially when they expected that she relates to witches as powerful as her. Especially when she's falling not for a wizard, but a magicless, human girl.
