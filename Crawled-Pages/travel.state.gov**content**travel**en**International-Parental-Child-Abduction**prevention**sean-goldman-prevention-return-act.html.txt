                Information about the Sean and David Goldman International Child Abduction Prevention and Return Act
    As required by Title III of the International Child Abduction Prevention and Return Act 6 U.S.C. 241, the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), in coordination with the U.S. Department of State and other federal agencies, has established a program that seeks to prevent the departure of a child from the United States when presented with an order from a court of competent jurisdiction which prohibits the child’s removal from the United States.
Parents who are concerned their child will be abducted, or who have questions about the International Child Abduction Prevention and Return Act and other abduction prevention measures, may contact the Department of State Office of Children’s Issues Prevention Branch at 1-888-407-4747 or via email at preventabduction1@state.gov.
