    Summary
      Sherlock found his life perfectly suitable. He had his work, Mrs. Hudson, a morbidly obese brother, and His Mind Palace. Perfectly suitable but perfectly dull. However, when he meets a down in his luck med student on a gap year, he also meets perhaps the most intriguing mystery of all. The mystery of John Watson.  Inspired by "Your Lie in April"

    Summary
      Another typical day, and case for one Sherlock Holmes, and faithful lackey John Watson, but what happens when they find a half starved child while investigating a murder, and which will take precedence?  Told in the form of John's Blog, this is subject to change, but so far I'm enjoying it too much. (Also, I know John is breaking HIPPA, just roll with it for the Plot.) Also, I'm from the US and will use what British slang/ dialect I know, but I will fall short. I am also not personally Trans, so if my depictions are off, please just let me know. Have fun! Also if you have a problem with Trans characters/ people, DON'T READ

    Summary
      John Watson knew quite a lot about the inner workings of Sherlock Holmes, and the same could be said of Sherlock's knowledge of John. However things are about to change for the doctor and the detective. Both in a figurative AND a literal sense. Thank you so much to MsScarlet for betareading and Britpicking my story! You are wonderful in so many ways! New chapters to appear weekly unless otherwise noted. Gifted to the amazing and super talented CarmillaCarmine. Your stories were made to inspire other writers like myself! &lt;3

    Summary
      大英政府偶然间克隆出了一个Sherlock Holmes，从此，贝克街221B就多了一个宝宝出来°( ´▽` )°  ‖#医生和侦探因为带娃感情极速升温，最后过上了美满的幸福生活~温馨日常文~高甜预警~结局大团圆~\(≧▽≦)/~在这个玻璃碴满天飞的世界~你还等什么！不要犹豫了快跟我进坑吃糖~# 作者的话呃…好吧，这样看起来，我大概是疯了。故事是这样的，hobbitts在微博客上发表的短篇连环漫画让我心碎了一地。但是我又已经开始写一篇关于年轻Sherlock的小说了，所以我觉得我需要重新检查一下那篇小说。“太糟糕了，”我这样想，“因为我不能让他是Sherlock的儿子，我真的不能接受Sherlock有孩子。”但是，这个想法一直没有消失，在我写下这篇小说第一句话之后，一个想法猛然进入我的脑海：【如果这个孩子是克隆版的Sherlock呢！】好吧，这可能是世界上最疯狂的想法之一了，但是我有点对它着迷，我承认。不管怎么说，我都完全不知道这个故事接下来会发生什么，我甚至有点放任它自由发展。但是考虑到这个故事写了一万五千字，才刚刚写到宝宝的第一次沐浴，我开始觉得它完全向着一篇冗长琐碎的记事小说发展了。我想，是时候一点一点的发表它了，让你们和我一起走完这段旅程。这篇与我的其它小说相比可能更趋向于交谈化，但是希望这会很有趣？感谢...（此处省略一段）译者的话（2016.10.1）呃...好吧，这样看起来，我大概是疯了。刚刚开学太闲决定翻译N&amp;N，之后学校一直有各种杂事，用半个多月再刷了一遍，今天开始，哦不，是昨天开始动笔，...我困了，动wps，然后有点停不下来，Sherlock好高冷好萌~\(≧▽≦)/~John人妻属性爆表~\(≧▽≦)/~宝宝有点小腹黑~\(≧▽≦)/~oh，God我有点欲罢不能了，好吧睡觉〒_〒困了也没有什么效率...啊！最后~祖国母亲生快*\^O^/*

    Summary
      There were many ways, countless moments and ample opportunities for the multi-headed hydra, which was sentimentality, to rear its ugly head in the space between Sherlock and John’s undefined relationship. It was only a matter of time before Sherlock was able to name this previously indefinable emotion. Love.  
The five times Sherlock might have fallen in love with John and the one time John realised.
