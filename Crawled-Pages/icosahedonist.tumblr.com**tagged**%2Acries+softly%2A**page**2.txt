You will always have a spot at our dinner table, and extra sticks in our hockey room. I’ll miss seeing you at the rink every day. Never forget how good you guys are. Thank you again, Leafs nation.

They’re barely in their 30s. It’s amazing.” https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/03/04/Evgeni-Malkin-milestone-1-000-points-teammates-Crosby-Letang-Fleury/stories/201903030197Career milestone — 'huge point' — within reach for Evgeni Malkin
                    Evgeni Malkin should pick up his 1,000th NHL point this week. “I know it’s coming,” Malkin said. “Huge point, in my opinion.”
