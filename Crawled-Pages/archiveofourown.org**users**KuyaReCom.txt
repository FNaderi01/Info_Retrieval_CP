    Summary
      There are three things Flamebringer don't expect for him to be a part of or have some sort of connection to:1) A polaroid picture (At least the quality is good, he doesn't know much about photography)2) Magallan's precious penguin blanket (The one which she brings with every time they have a movie night. Which is often)3) Executor's furnace/body heater/hug pillow (He's still trying to figure this one out)Or; to simplify things, Executor thinks that Flamebringer is a great person (demon) to crash into. And oh, if you ask him, he'll tell you that Flamebringer's so warm.

    Summary
      Of course Sakusa Kiyoomi's most memorable features are his moles, it's either that or his permanent scowl which rivals even Kageyama from SA, who is a legend among scowls out of scowls. Your choice, really, he doesn't care what his fanatics think as long as they're not starting to worship him. (He is currently staring at your soul, because you won't be here if you at least don't think he's lowkey hot)Of course Miya Atsumu has a mole on his hip bone, and rather than connecting it to his twin brother, Sakusa thinks about how pretty Atsumu is in a surprisingly - positive way.

    Summary
      They say you must enjoy your last year of high school, but this is Korea, where fun means late-night study cramps so you can achieve minimum terms to apply for any college available.Fun also means when Eduan needs to pretend-date Jahad so he can prove not-so-little innocent Aguero that he's a great model example of a brother.Includes: Siblings blackmailing each other, the school's golden couple, death threats from Enryu, V literally kicking everyone's asses and finding out how cute Jahad is when he smiles. (The last part, maybe he noticed it since they first met 5 years ago. Maybe not.)

    Summary
      He wakes up with numbness at every inch of his fingertips, ice flurrying with each twirl, and a fizzling memory of blue and gold. And the given name of Khun.
Otherwise; I embark on a journey to find my family and someone who represents the night, while trying to not let fear seep out with the coldness from my heart.

    Summary
      To Flamebringer, Executor is Angel, a beautiful escort given to him for a fun night. To Executor, Flamebringer is another thug playing boss in the wrong place. They should have only crossed path once before becoming a distant memory. It should be all there is to it.
Of course, it is never that simple.

    Summary
      The worst was when he learnt that they were assigned a two-nights mission, which meant sleeping outside Rhodes Island with that freaking robot. Did you expect Flamebringer to react well? No, and he was immediately pinned under W’s knee. And who would Flamebringer be to hurt W? Nobody, he was a dumbass but not a piece of crap.
