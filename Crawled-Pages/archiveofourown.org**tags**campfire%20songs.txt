    Summary
      A mute young man lights out for the Colorado territory to cure his ills but gets mobbed by a gang of outlaw rustlers. Stranded in the desert, he finds a family of outcast cattlemen plus true love along his journey to personal freedom.
This is like BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN or GOD'S OWN COUNTRY if those stories were more upbeat, more diverse, and set in 1895!
(Screenplay format, but give it a shot anyway!)

    Summary
      “It’s hard not to be constantly talked about around here. Everyone has a name in something. But everyone knows Bokuto. It’s the same with Kuroo and it’s getting to be the same with Koganegawa, but Bokuto is the king of getting people to like him.” Iwaizumi let out a small, weak chuckle, strolling down the row a little more, touching a white appaloosa on the muzzle. Such an aesthetically pleasing horse. “He annoyed the shit out of me at first, but I’d give my life for the son of a bitch now. He’s a good guy. Got a heart of gold.”-When Keiji visits his father's ranch for the first time in six years, he plans to keep to himself. Too bad most of the people inhabiting the ranch have a different plan. Most notably, a certain ranch hand with wicked hair and nearly golden eyes.

    Summary
      Island existence, a concept that should be oh so simple. Until you have no service, monsters attacking at night, a lack of food, a child who is now your pseudo sibling, an angry boyfriend who's probably going to kill you and a policeman who wants to know way more than he should about your love life then he should be.At least Shin doesn't have to deal with all them right... right?!
