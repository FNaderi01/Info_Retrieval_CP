        Archive of Our Own"Let's see the world, Mr. Stark!"By Organization for Transformative WorksHey everyone.So, seeing as I usually get approximately 3 to 4 hours of sleep on a nightly basis due to my insomnia, I decided to be productive and write today since I got 11.It never happens, so I can’t promise consistent updates, but this is my first published work so I’m pretty curious to see where it goes.I’d love some kudos, comments, constructive criticism, and frequent readers would be beyond appreciated.I also tend to lose friends quickly so I’d love to make some new ones :)Later.-Lina

                                                That's because Y/n is very good at hiding how they feel about me.                    Scott:
