    Summary
      I don't write fanfics very often, but Lumity is so cute and my little queer heart loves these gaybies. This will probably terrible cause I don't outline anything -_-

    Summary
      “I just can’t get it right,” Amity says desperately, feeling bitter tears well up in her eyes. She is quick to wipe them away. “No matter what I do, it comes out wrong!”
“Hey, hey,” Edric is on his feet instantly, and she feels his hands rest gently, awkwardly, on her shoulders. “What’s up? You know you’ll nail any essay they give you, rig-” he cuts himself off, and she knows he’s seen the notes. The notes that prove that she’s more than the cold, top student she so desperately wants to be. The notes that prove people can get to her.
Well. Maybe just one person in general.

    Summary
      “The best track at Hexside is the Abomination track,” says Father. “That will be the track you will attend,” says Mother.Amity doesn’t want to. She is good at making Abominations already; some would even say she’s naturally talented, but. She’s always enjoyed other studies more so. She’s always been interested in Beast Keeping, or perhaps Potions, and maybe even Healing would be intriguing, but Abomination? The same thing she’s been doing for years already?She takes too long to answer. Father says, “Amity,” in his voice that means, answer when we speak to you. Amity swallows; says, “okay.”

    Summary
      “Y’know, because-” Willow begins, fixing her with a confused stare, “because you two are together. Right?”Amity feels like the entire world has just ground to a complete and utter halt. “WHAT?!”
Or
Five times someone thinks Amity and Luz are dating plus the one time Amity finally Figures It Out (and maybe works through some of her own issues along the way)

    Summary
      Ed and Em decide to play a mean prank on Amity at school. Luckily Amity has people on her side.The continuation to There’s a Luz loose in my garden! I recommend reading all the previous parts in this series (in order: Own your narrative, Amity’s calamity, Boiling drain and There’s a Luz loose in my garden) for context.Caution/TW/CW: ANGST, periods, blood mention, bullying, problematic family dynamics.
