    Summary
      Title's from the Iron and Wine song used in the show. 
Soulmates AU - in this case, you're born with a tattoo of the first words your soulmate says to you. Used a bit of artistic licence – technically Nathan's would be 'I’m not a pantysniffer', but that’s too cruel to be tattooed on someone, even Nathan; plus I feel like even he might guess. Maybe.  
It's a WIP, I'm guessing it'll be about ten chapters in full.

      “Are you all right?” Simon mutters, reaching up and hesitantly brushing his fingers against Nathan’s shoulder where it rests on his chest.“All right?!” Nathan sits up suddenly, eyes wide. “I’m brilliant! You saved my life, Barry!” He grins ear to ear, and Simon exhales nervously with a small smile as Nathan laughs almost hysterically.

    Summary
      The war was over. Sasuke was still an idiot, but they were mostly getting over that. Everyone else was just trying to get back to some semblance of normalcy in the era after facing the Juubi and losing so much. Hatake Kakashi never wanted to be Hokage but that's what he became. With that comes enemies. During an ambush, Naruto jumps in front of a Jutsu that would tear his former Sensei's soul from his body. The Jutsu begins to tear Kurama away instead. In a desperate bid to save both his and Naruto's life, Kurama does something almost as unpredictable as his host. He tries to send them back in time a day. This would have worked just fine, except Kurama might have...overshot things a bit. Oh, wow is that a chibi Naruto running around? What year is it again?  Jiraiya begins hearing rumors of a man called the "Lost Uzumaki" that has made a seismic debut on the shinobi world stage. The only thing is that S-class nin don't just pop out of nowhere...usually. Jiraiya is sent to track down the nin and determine his loyalties. His new life depends on a good impression. The good thing is that Uzumaki Naruto's true superpower is his ability to talk even the most unwilling into submission.

    Summary
      "So this is what Stiles does. He lies in Scott’s bed and waits for Melissa to say she’s found someone to get it out of him, to cure him of the wrongness and the bad, and he dreams. God, he dreams.He dreams of fire and swollen bellies and that scene in Alien, of giving birth to jackals through his urethra, the whole horrific nine yards. His head is a terrible place to be, he can’t imagine his stomach is much better, why anyone would want to put a thing inside of it."

    Summary
      While in New York City to visit his aspiring and success-hungry friend Scott, who left for an internship he fought for over several years ago, Stiles runs into an alpha with a devilish reputation and a dark, tantalizing look that precedes him. Couple that with horny loneliness and failed suppressants, and you’ve got the perfect recipe for a one-night stand that will set the bar forever.But what if forever isn’t something that the one person you’ve given yourself to wants? What if a forever is somehow growing inside of you after a few months pass and a planned heat is missed? What if you don’t know what to do and there’s only so much chocolate that can soothe an aching heart before you feel like you've got morning sickness all over again?This is a story about how Stiles loses his virginity alongside himself, and somehow, he manages to find something he never thought he’d ever have along the way.

    Summary
      In the aftermath of their final bout with Gerard, things kinda went to shit. Yeah, they won. But Scott had violated some major boundaries. Jackson was still an emotionally constipated douche. Erica and Boyd were missing. In general, everyone was left missing a piece of themselves in one form or another. There was also the fact that there was a literal pack of alphas bearing down on them. Stiles was really getting sick of this shit.

    Summary
      “Okay.” Stiles glanced at his phone, wincing at the battery being close to ten percent. It was probably time to call Scott. Turning off the flashlight, mostly to save battery and kind of freaking out over how dark it was—though the half-moon reflecting off the snow helped a bit—he opened his contacts with shaking hands and scrolled through to Scott’s name. Once he hit it, he put the phone to his ear, looking around, and froze. The phone rang in his ear, but his eyes were locked on something big and moving through the trees. Oh no. Oh no, no, no.If that was a fucking bear, Stiles was fucked! The line kept ringing and ringing, but Scott didn’t answer. Eventually his voicemail picked up and Stiles very slowly lowered the phone and hung up without looking, eyes still on the dark shape in the trees. He glanced down for only a second to turn on the flashlight function again, then lifted it ever so slowly upwards, and felt his breath freeze in his lungs. It was a wolf. It was a motherfucking wolf.
