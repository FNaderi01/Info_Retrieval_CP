Are the dates set in stone?  Doesn't the Senate still have to vote on the bill?  Doesn't President Bush still have to sign it into law? Juppiter 00:27, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
What about the tuna clause? —Preceding unsigned comment added by 68.75.44.213 (talk • contribs) 
That's a figment of some people's imagination...people that didn't bother to read the text of the legislation, or read it, and made stuff up anyway. Settler 00:19, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
Tuna clause? Juppiter 01:19, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
Myths are being used to support a conspiracy theory. One is that the act that was initially passed by the House creates, for the first time, a specific exemption for American Samoa from the minimum wage or minimum wage increases. American Samoa has actually been exempt from the mainland minimum wage for a long time, under existing law (the existing Fair Labor Standards Act). This is sometimes combined with the fact that Del Monte, a company whose subsidiary makes use of fishing for tuna in the territory of American Samoa, is headquartered in Speaker Pelosi's district. Hence the mythical "tuna clause." Settler 07:08, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
It was still kind of sloppy to propose transisting the Northern Mariana Islands to the Federal Minimum Wage without doing the same for nearby  American Samoa. Jon 21:05, 20 April 2007 (UTC)
North Mariana references need updated throughout the article[edit]
Did the final version include it or not? While we're at it, ensure the summary matches the final version and signficant changes compared to previous versions placed in some sort of history section. Jon 15:03, 29 May 2007 (UTC)
Both the Northern Marianas and American Samoa were included in the final bill, with different timetables for each for increases in their minimum wage. Settler 15:52, 29 May 2007 (UTC)
