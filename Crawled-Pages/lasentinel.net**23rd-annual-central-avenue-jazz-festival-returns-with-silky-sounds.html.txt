23rd Annual Central Avenue Jazz Festival Returns with Silky Sounds            
				By Sentinel News Service                
	                	                Published July 26, 2018
For more than two decades, the free Central Avenue Jazz Festival has been a staple for the South Los Angeles community. The revered summer event honors the historic rich cultural past of Central Avenue—once considered the epicenter of Jazz music— and returns July 28-29 from 11 a.m.-7 p.m.
        ADVERTISEMENT        
The citywide signature event features dozens of performances from Jazz greats and rising stars across four stages along Central Avenue between King Boulevard and Vernon Avenue. However, the festival offers so much more, including interactive pavilions, providing everything from free medical screenings to leads on job opportunities, and even soccer matches for the kids.
Betty Bryant Alex
Patrons visiting the pavilions will be treated to:
– GRoW @ Annenberg Health &amp; Wellness Pavilion will provide free and confidential medical services for everyone in the family including health, vision and dental screenings. Healthy eating tips will be provided, along with cooking demonstrations.
– Arts Pavilion curated by LA Mancha Gallery, featuring cutting-edge artwork from top artists in Los Angeles, as well as live art demonstrations from local muralists and graffiti artists.
– The NEW 9th Business &amp; Jobs Pavilion inviting emerging and established business owners, entrepreneurs and job seekers to obtain important information that will guide them down the path to success.
– Balfour Beatty Youth Pavilion where children can enjoy fun soccer games presented by Street Soccer USA, learn the basics of traditional Cuban Rumba provided by Latin Percussion and a chance to create your own acrylic painting led by the non-profit organization Art Active. There will also be carnival games and arts &amp; crafts.
Pete Escovedo
The two-day celebration will have an array of food trucks and vendors that will provide a variety of multicultural dishes, such as Mexican barbeque, Jamaican cuisine, vegan options and Soul food for purchase.
“We want people to come for the music but stay for the unique experience!” said Councilman Curren D. Price, Jr., who hosts the fan-favorite event in the 9th District. “Where else can you get a free summer concert complete with medical screenings, enjoyable physical activities and art classes? This festival truly has something for everybody.”
Each year, the Central Avenue Jazz Festival draws tens of thousands of people to enjoy live entertainment from legends and up-and-coming artists. This year’s all-star lineup features performances by Myron McKinley Trio, Pete Escovedo Orchestra, Boogaloo Assassins, Kátia Moraes and Brazilian Hearts, Betty Bryant, TC Carson, Ernie Andrews, Tierney Sutton Band, Andrae Alexander, Connie Han Trio, Gretchen Parlato and Roy Gaines &amp; The Blues for Life Band.
Festival parking is extremely limited and public transit and ride sharing is highly recommended. For more information on the 23rd Annual Central Avenue Jazz Festival, including artists’ bios, vendor information and shuttle service, please visit www.centralavejazzfest.com.
