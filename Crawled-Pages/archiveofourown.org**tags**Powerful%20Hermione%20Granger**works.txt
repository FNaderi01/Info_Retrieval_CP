    Summary
      She was like a worm delving deeper into his brain, squiggling around behind his eyes, forcing her way into the darkest recesses of his moral being. The more he was around her, the less control he had over himself. Insidious, that's what this was. These feelings had snuck up on him and rendered him almost a complete fool, making him feel invalidated, making his feelings seem worthless and unwanted. But he wouldn't stop. No! He couldn't.That damned Granger girl would be his, even if he had to kill to get her. Please read the tags. This isn't a happy, smutty, fluffy fanfic. There will be no happy ending.

    Summary
      For a moment, the only sound that can be heard is harsh breathing. Then she draws out her wand. He can’t stop her, nor would he. He had lost too much to give up his pride now. He stays mute as she tears his sleeve open to reveal skin where the the dark mark had been when the Dark Lord lived. With slow, deliberate flicks, a word appears over the newly healed skin. Coward, it says. Red and angry against his alabaster skin. “Look at it” she says viciously. “Look at it, and remember how you couldn’t save your father. He died, just like your mother will. You burn everything you touch, Malfoy. You’re incapable of creating any other outcome. You’re weak and cowardly and worthless and small. Where’s your precious pureblood ideals now? They’re dead. I fought for the right to be here, while you were hiding behind your daddy’s skirts. Fuck you, Malfoy. To think I felt guilty for refusing to help you”

    Summary
      Tom was now standing straight, looking right at her. He was supposed to be horrified by what he just witnessed. He was supposed to feel sick from the images still flashing through his mind. Tom knew she was manipulative and cunning, always a step ahead of everyone and sometimes even himself. 
Still, he felt like meeting her for the first time on this night for she was not a flame as he thought at the beginning but an entire wildfire. And he was basking in her blazing heat. 
He looked at the scar on her neck. He must have looked at it hundreds of times yet he truly saw it for the first time. The scar he knew she bore below her coat, the one the purple spell carved, the one he felt and bled through his shirt was right there. And he felt the sudden urge to touch it. 
She was standing in front of him in all of her glory and she was magnificent.

    Summary
      All magical children get soul marks, Hermione has two.In the years before Hogwarts they are a lifeline to Hermione, but once she realises there is a whole new world at her fingertips love doesn't seem like a priority. With her home life getting worse and worse she will do anything to cling onto her place in the magical world, even if it means occasionally having to battle a Dark Lord.Fred and George have always wished to have the same soul mate but it seems to good to be true. So why are they so invested in their little brother's new friend?There hasn't been a triad bond since the time of Merlin himself but change is coming. Hermione is the smartest witch of her age for a reason and with her two twins behind her she will be unstoppable. When Voldemort discovers the existence of this ancient bond, Harry Potter may no longer be his priority...This story will follow the triad from their pre-Hogwarts years all the way through to the bitter end (any maybe beyond). Also, bit of Draco and Harry that I might make into their own accompaniment story.

STolen from her resting place, watch the world burns as people deal with the consequences of their actions and what happens when lesser men and women attempt to take what is rightfully theirs.

    Summary
      Updated: Aug 24, 2019. I edited some of the early chapters (there might still be some errors with grammar and spellings, just ignore them pls ^_^) After being betrayed by her love on the day she thought her dreams will come true, she was saved by the most unexpected person. Reuniting with past friends, strengthening bonds with her family, discovering more about magic and meeting the people behind their masks helped Hermione survive and live.   Disclaimer: All characters from the book are owned by J.K. Rowling. Only the OCs are mine.#Dramione#Some characters may (WILL) have some bashing and some character changes ^^#I have also uploaded the story in Wattpad (I actually uploaded it there first: https://www.wattpad.com/story/90017424-in-my-enemy's-arms

    Summary
      Non-canon compliant, sort-of retelling, of Half-Blood Prince. But with Hermione Granger as the main character.Hermione Granger seeks to navigate her 6th year after sending her parents to Australia with new memories. Minerva McGonagall is finding recovering from "the stunner incident" a difficult and long-winded task. Hermione helps her heal and finds a new book, filled with comments about Transfiguration and after one too many nasty remarks nearly kills another student with one of the spells within. With Professor McGonagall in charge of her punishment, will things sour? Or will they discover that family is what you make of it and perhaps they just might come through this war in one piece. Together.
