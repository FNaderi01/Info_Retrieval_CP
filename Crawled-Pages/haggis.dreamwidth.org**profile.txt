                 Mini Bio
                The word "Mamihlapinatapai" means "To look at each other, each hoping the other will offer to do something which both parties much desire done but which neither is willing to do".  In other words, I fancy a cup of tea.I'm a sexy, happy, confused, curious, sarcastic, tactless-but-caring, open-minded, loyal, fat, feminist, optimistic, sometimes-shy-sometimes-shameless bisexual engineering geek-chick who tends to witter a lot.Edit 2007I wrote that bio in about 2001 but it's still basically true.  Since then, I've graduated from uni, moved away from Manchester and came running back at high speed, found a job that pays the bills, exercises my brain and makes the world better in a small way and married my beloved fluffyarmadillo.I am incredibly, wonderfully lucky in my husband and also in my lovely friends.
