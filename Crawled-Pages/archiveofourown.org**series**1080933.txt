      Description:
      Lexa Heda has fallen.They had said so, when a bullet had broke her spine. And she had thought so as well. Her era was over, her time as Commander was done; she thought she could rest. Her fight was over, her people had said. She was no longer Commander; no longer a leader; unbefitting for the role, and befit for a sombre end. She dies a hero; it would be how history remembers her, even if it were a lie. Never had they envisioned a rise.
      Notes:
      ...Previously titled Broken Chairs.- TL;DR: Lexa is paralysed from Titus' bullet. Follows a Canon-Divergence S3 onwards.- Inconsequential and Forgotten is in Lexa's First-Person POV, and Negligible is in Third-Person.Update Schedules:- Negligible Update Schedule: Updates once or twice a month.

    Summary
  I was once the Commander. I was once Heda. The Commander of the Twelve Clans. Their Savior; their leader; their Heda.
  But all that ended when Titus' bullet shattered my spine.
 Or, Lexa survives the bullet, but not the damage that's done along with it.

    Summary
  They had come in, like the clock-hand that tracked time with its ticks, one entering after the other every time the arm had struck twelve.
 Or, Lexa's five visitors after the bullet. Missing scenes from Inconsequential.

    Summary
  Lexa never really thought she would see another human being other than Clarke after the apocalypse. Not that she was complaining. By all means, she and Clarke were the last people standing on the face of Earth, save for those floating in the sky and thriving underground.
But there was a child. A Natblida child, gawking at her like she couldn't believe she was the last true Commander. Or, Lexa and Clarke both survive Praimfaya, and meet a small but ferocious Natblida in Shallow Valley.
