    Summary
      He had witnessed the murder of his parents. The heroes had promised to protect them. They promised to save him and and his family from the evil that awaited them. When the time came, they were never there. Kaminari has learned to despise heroes and everything they stand for. He is a villain working in the league and has infiltrated the UA, disguised as the one thing he vowed to never become: a hero. He had made friends with his pathetic classmates and was not what they thought. His lies would be forever weaved in a tangled web. It was only a matter of time before everything feel apart.

“For as long as I could remember, I knew I could never be a hero.”
“. . . Being a villain is the only way I know how to survive.”

Things that are part of the same story will be marked now, for example, [Gone Rogue AU] or [Delinquent AU] in the chapter notes.

    Summary
      Denki, Ochako, and Izuku are omegas who give into their omegan desires. At a young age they all decided to become prostitution. Shouto watches over them to keep them out of trouble, although he doesn't agree with what they're doing. What he hates most is that he feels like he's putting his pack in something that could end in trouble. The three have lost so much, and have been through so much, and yet they insist on doing this. Even after they fall in love and find mates, they insist on keeping their jobs. What can convince them to stop?

    Summary
      The love Ochako gives and receives from her friends. Where they meet and where they end.
Consider this a self-satisfying ochabowl with vaguely platonic and romantic undertones. Relationship tags will be updated as I discover more repairs that got me in love.

    Summary
      Despite the growth in society thanks to quirks, with the positives came discrimination. Some professions required specific quirks and cost, financially. To become a hero, a quirked person needed to have the appropriate funds to do so. To become a hero, you had to know someone or have recognition to your name. Uraraka was going to change that.♤♡◇♧Uraraka never thought she'd become a hero like she'd always dreamed of being, until one fateful day she's given the chance to prove herself at UA Academy. She won't let anyone throw away her chance, and that includes the bullies known as the F4.NOTE: This is an Ocha-Bowl, Uraraka-centered fic with no confirmed endgame ship.

    Summary
      His stomach felt like it’d been put into a blender and ground until it was nothing but blood, acid and clumps of intestines. He took a few more steps, wobbly and slow, until he collapsed. Eyes heavily lidded, acid and upchuck began to crawl up his esophagus until blood began to leak from his mouth. His eyes slowly widened at the site, fatigue wearing off immediately and causing him to dart up from his position on his side. He’d done this so fast that his stomach couldn’t handle it...
