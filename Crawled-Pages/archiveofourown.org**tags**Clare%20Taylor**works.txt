    Summary
      This is a sequel to - You've Got To Hide Your Love Away.  This new story picks up in early 1975 and continues the love story of two aspiring musicians who found love together under unusual circumstances.  I encourage you to read the first story to fully enjoy this sequel due to original characters, character development and existing plotlines.   Brian and Roger fell in love and have stayed together against all odds.  They struggled through the hardships of forming their band and seeing it rise to success.  1975 holds the promise of real fame and fortune.  It has been hard to hide their love away from the public.  Can they keep it private or will the pressures of fame and fortune drive them apart?  They are preparing to return to America in hopes of completing a tour. Everything is looking up for the band and these two as a new year begins.  Their professional career is taking off and the world is at their feet but their personal lives soon get hit by something completely unexpected.  Brian and Roger try to cope with a surprising addition to their lives.  Roger can't deal with the changes in his life and Brian finds himself questioning everything he thought about who they are together.  Can their relationship survive?

Freddie hadn’t brought anyone home, or stayed the night with anyone- how could he, when the world took one look at the mark on his neck and thought he was taken? There was, by all logic, only one person he could have slept with.Brian and Deacy had both been away a month ago…Roger."OR: one drunken, impulsive night changes everything, leaving Roger and Freddie with a lot of feelings to sort out.

    Summary
      Roger's fighting mad. Well, he gets dramatic on work done after a show and Freddie storms off to a place Rog has never before been, but decides to go. After all, he may be miffed but that's no reason not to watch out for his friend. Besides, he's game for just about anything. Nothing wrong with new experiences, hey?(Or, whilst on tour in the late seventies, Roger goes after Freddie to a leather bar and experiences some hitherto un-encountered aspects of urban nightlife)

      Roger Taylor works at Jim's Records. His best friend Freddie works there too, with his boyfriend John. His twin sister comes in to annoy them after school. It's the same routine, but Roger doesn't seem to mind, especially when he has his manager, Brian Harold May, to stare at all day long.
