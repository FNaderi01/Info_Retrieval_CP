    Summary
      I am so excited about this year's Whumptober Challenge! I am taking my prompt list from Wildmage. They released an  amazing  prompt list for a whump x kink 'tober which can be found on their twitter. I will only be doing the Whump portion, as writing kink is still super scary to me! Anyways.... This month is going to hurt a lot and I am ready to release my angst into the universe!

He's so close to starving, in so much danger of fading to oblivion...he can't face that. He's not ready. And maybe he doesn't have to be, because the moving people have set up his room as a bedroom...but he shouldn't get his hopes up.If there's a permanent resident on whom he can prey, everything will be fine...but he shouldn't get his hopes up...Footsteps approach his room, and stop outside the door...but he shouldn't get his hopes up..."Wangji, here's your room," says an unfamiliar voice...but he shouldn't get his hopes up......and the door opens...and it's a kid.Fuck.He knew he shouldn't have gotten his hopes up.Or: the one where Wei Wuxian is the horrible amorphous tentacle monster that lives under the bed...and Lan Wangji might just be worth starving to protect...(See author's notes for more explanation of the major archive warnings)Kinktober Day 7: rimming or breeding or Tentacles

    Summary
      Island existence, a concept that should be oh so simple. Until you have no service, monsters attacking at night, a lack of food, a child who is now your pseudo sibling, an angry boyfriend who's probably going to kill you and a policeman who wants to know way more than he should about your love life then he should be.At least Shin doesn't have to deal with all them right... right?!

    Summary
      “Infinite sadness,” Obi-Wan says into the dark. “When Satine and I were on the run for that year oh so long ago, we stopped at the tent of a fortune teller. And when the teller read mine, she said that I was made for infinite sadness.”Or, a mission gone wrong leads to Anakin and Obi-Wan trapped in a cell, unable to escape for weeks on end with too few rations and too much time. They talk, and it changes everything.

    Summary
      Barricade did not have a happy childhood. He still decided to go on to be an Enforcer, to help people. But there's so much temptation out there, and some bribes for looking the other way are far too easy to justify as "helping people." Internal affairs get involved, and then it goes steadily downhill. After all, who on Cybertron would hire an ex-Enforcer, convicted for corruption, possession, and public indecency?
