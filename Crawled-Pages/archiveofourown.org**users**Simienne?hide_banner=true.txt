    Summary
      Agatha decides that even if she's not planning to back down about driving Castle Wulfenbach out of Mechanicsburg airspace, it might be worth letting the Baron know she doesn't really want anybody hurt. Klaus wouldn't be impressed with this as a gesture of reconciliation, but he can't resist the puzzle of why "Lucrezia" is writing to him.
