I have recently discovered Roberto Ferri, an artist working in oils whose body of work answers the question "What if Caravaggio's work had both more nudity and more body horror :D".Also, it's making me want to do oils again.

I have spent roughly 75% of this weekend asleep and I don't even know WHY. I'm not kidding, I could barely manage to be awake 6h/day and even then even awake all I wanted was to sleep more. WTFI had plans (boardgames with friends, check out the pool, go see a shelter for a cat...) but I couldn't do any of them because I was just fucking sleeping all the goddamn time. I also couldn't do things like get the groceries. No life. Only sleep.

I met up with an artist friend today to do some socially distanced drawing in a nearby park.We spent so much time catching up that we never got around to the actual drawing part and I have zero regrets. She's a semi-pro artist and has self-published multiple comics so she always has a lot of genuinely good advice when I ask related questions.Also, I know this sounds a bit silly, she's had good things happen lately. And tbh it was really nice to talk to someone and have them have good news.

1. I have come across fundraiser / charity to move the  Quileute Tribal School outside of a tsunami zone.2. I was looking for an epub version of Le Roman de Renart (possibly best known around these parts as the story that changed the French word for fox) and found this page which has not only Le Roman de Renart but also a bunch of other books such as Baudelaire's translation of some Poe's short stories and Flaubert's Salammbô. It is 10+% Victor Hugo by volume3. Speaking of Salammbô, I wanted to use the incipit, "C’était à Mégara, faubourg de Carthage, dans les jardins d’Hamilcar.", in something I am currently writing. But then I realised (a) I am writing the thing in English, (b) while relatively famous in French, the chance of it being a known phrase in English are pretty low and (c) I don't like "It was at Megara, a suburb of Carthage, in the gardens of Hamilcar" idk mate it's just not the same *whine*This is a pretty silly problem on my end but at least it's not as silly as the time I structured a story around the vous -&gt; tu shift in the conversation between two people despite, again, writing in English. /too French for their own good

I have become a parody of myselfSep. 3rd, 2020 01:22 am
... I just spend a not insignificant amount of time being mad at Cicero for being Wrong On The Internet and writing my fave OOCOk more seriously his characterisation of Scipio in Somnium Scipionis is BadBasically I refuse to believe Scipio would talk about the razing of Carthage like it's a good thing ("Within these two years you will destroy it as Consul; and that title, which so far you bear as an inheritance from me, shall be won for you by your own achievement." MY LEFT FOOT in this house we do not respect genocidaires) If Scipio had wanted to delenda himself a Carthago he could have! But he didn't! And even if he had he wouldn't have done it by comitting fucking genocideAlso I hate Cicero's overly long-winded writing style.I cannot believe this needs saying but: I like verbs, ok.( I also like memes )What could possibly make it worse? Why to have two characters with THE EXACT SAME NAME, of course! He chose to refer to Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus Africanus Minor and Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus Maior both as Scipio Africanus which is technically not inaccurate I GUESS but a maddeningly confusing way to go (and yes if you were wondering it is also confusing and The Worst in French)Why, Cicero? WHY?!

The Magnus Archives s1 &amp; s2Sep. 1st, 2020 01:04 am
Have a bunch of my thoughts about The Magnus Archives (TMA) seasons 1 and 2. Fair warning it is a bit...( Cut to spare you my nonsense )While listening to episode 42 I was going GOSH JONNY DRAG YOUR BAND HARDER WHY DON'T YOU. Though I later realised it is a compliment in context, actually, hahaha. If you're not getting murdered by music did you ever truly live?Usually I don't really care about spoilers but in this case I am enjoying coming up with bullshit theoris way too much so please no spoilers.

So I just found out that some US jerkass vandalised the Scots language version of Wikipedia by writing articles in English with a phonetic accent which WOW FUCK YOU.As a speaker of a minority language (brezhoneg) I am kind of righteously mad? It's hard enough finding resources about/in small languages without people deliberately pissing in the pot, ffs.Thankfully brezhoneg looks nothing like French, so whenever I visit the bzh wiki in peace, but that doesn't help Scots speakers, does it?(Yes. I sometimes visit the brezhoneg wiki. I am trying to improve my literacy, ok.)(Most recently I was looking at the page for Kartada (Carthage), because I was looking for thie bit of info "Dont a ra hec'h anv eus ar Fenikianeg Qart-ḥadašt (diskrivadenn vrezhonekaet: Kart C'hadacht)" ie "Its name comes from the Phoenician Qart-ḥadašt (transliterated in breton as Kart C'hadacht)" (bolding mine). Just needed to make sure I was pronouncing it right in my head. Which I was, having assumed the ḥ to be be equal to c'h on absolutely no basis at all. /end tangent)

Do it for the vampiresAug. 27th, 2020 12:30 am
Earlier today I was listening to a podcast about Dracula* and it reminded me that I never talked about the three things I think are really important about Dracula and yet are left out of almost all adaptations.( (\(*vv*)/) )*Dracula ou les Dents du désir which was quite good and interesting although it did contain the boiling hot take of "protestants write vampires more than catholics because their church does not provide enough blood and drama". I really want to see the research on that, no lie.

"I sure hope you like coconut" cookiesAug. 27th, 2020 12:24 am
By popular demand! (Where popular = yuuago  + schneefink )Ingredients125g shredded coconut/coconut powder80g melted butter80g sugar100g flour5g yeast1 whole egg( Notes )RecipePre-heat oven at 180°C.Mix all ingredients. It is a very dense dough, so I recommend not using a whisk.Make dough blobs. Remember to practice physical distancing.Cook for 10mn.Eat! They keep for at least a week. I've always eaten them before then.I also call these my "blood donation cookies" because I make them to eat a few days before giving blood and eat them daily until and after I do give blood. Coconut is high in iron! And it is a good excuse for cookies.

No internet. Only sleep.Aug. 7th, 2020 12:53 am
My internet access currently works on a "if the wind is right and the tide is high" basis. So I have been napping more than usual and also reading. On occasions I get to pet the neighbourhood cat.Anyway. I thought I could use the time to figure out how the middle third of this story is supposed to go but as always I am stuck on the middle-y bits. Does anyone have any advice? Like in general.

I've recently come across Photoreal Roman Emperor Project: 54 Machine-learning assisted portraits. In particular, I liked seeing, in the detailed posts, what sources the artist used as his bases for each portrait.  I will admit that three things I find odd:  - The difference in lightsources in the composite end-portraits. Some are lit softly, some harshly/with higher contrast and some even look washed out/over exposed. - Hair textures. Okay, wtf? Pretty much everyone's hair is straighter in the end-portraits than in the busts. It's most aparent in say Lucius Verus but it's pretty obvius in most of them. Starting with Augustus! Does this not look like two different hair textures to other people?! He went from having wavy/wide curl hair to having straight hair. Maybe I'm just used to mediterranean hair mad because OG Augustus has hair v similar to mine and the composite does not.  - Ulpia Severina appears to have been composited entirely from gendershifting her husband Aurelian.Whici is certainly A Choice but ok! I am more mad that zero effort appears to have been made to recteate the hairstyle shown in the coins. I know recreating numismatic hairstyles is a pain and a half -- having myself tried to recreate Carthaginian female hairstyles based on coins depicting Dido etc -- and it's not like I expct everyone o know who Janet Stephens is, but it took me less than five minutes, starting onthe wikipedia page for Roman hairstyles, to find this video of her recreating a similar, though earlier, hairstyle.On an only vaguely related note, I wonder when Elagabalus became known as Héliogabale in French. The Ela -&gt; Helio shift likely happened because sun cult but when?

SO. Let's do this again, yes.Sometime ago I made a decision to read one (1) chapter of something "serious" before I would go read mush because for a while now I have been frustrated with my inability to read just about anything. During lockdown I bribed myself to go on doctor-ordered walks by saying I would get to read something brain candy esque.Finished readingShow Your Work, by Austin Kleon: The first success of the 'dhampyresa bribes self to read things' initiative. Picked this up from a rec by yhlee some mumblemumble months ago. It's a book about how to use social media to promote your art/work. It's quite interesting! Though I did notice the quotes/examples are almost all male and I wish it had not been that way. Would reccomend.Currently readingCoping Skills, by Faith G Harper: Have only read the introduction so far.How to think when you draw book 1, by Lorenzo Etherington: It's not really a "reading" book, it's more of a "viewing one tutorial a day and chewing on it for a while" book. At least for me! I am a bit saddened that it falls into the "male characters can be as monstrous/ugly/exaggerated as possible while female characters have to be pretty" trap. The other tutorials I have read so far are really good though! I especially like the advice on pattern breaks and the composition breakdown is a+.A survival guide for the stranded timetravelers, by Ryan North: A comedic non-fiction book that takes the lens of "helping timetraveler to recreated civilisation" to look at how human civilisation developped across the globe. It's really quite interesting! I had never considered how rare the idea of writing was or how calorie surplus is a necessary condition to civilisation, for example.Tranny, by Laura Jane Grace: The autobiography of the (trans woman) lead singer of Against Me! Am not very far into it but it is very interesting so far. Grace does refer do her younger, male-presenting self using male terms, fyi.Axiom's End, by Lindsay Ellis: I am enjoying this but not as much as I thought I would? Maybe once the alien shows up properly I'll like it more.AND A BAJILLION COMICS ON WEBTOON. Not sure if anyone wants to hear about that?

I have things to doJul. 23rd, 2020 02:27 am
Earlier today I was reading ‘Knowing it could kill you isn’t a deterrent’: the deadly trade in diet pills. The article centers around DNP, a chemical not meant for human consumption. It also contains quotes from survivors and sufferers of anorexia nevrosa -- suoting two those under the cut.( Cut for graphic )But then. BUT THEN. I thought, clear as anything, "I don't want to die. I have things to do."I don't know if it's because I was at a (different) friend's funeral less than a week ago and/or I am dtruggling to finish some drawings before my train tomorrow, but it's true. I don't want to die and I do have things to do.I feel like it's the first time in my life I've ever consciously thought this. It seemed worth writing down.

Just back from a funeral. At least there was a funeral this time? Silver linings feel so thin, these days.
