    Summary
      Seokjin is your average pizza delivery guy, he gets sent to a house on a dirt road on a foggy night. His car breaks down and encounters some strange phenomenons. "The road was old and unkempt. A multitude of potholes littered the dirt street, mud clinging to the car's tires. The car bobs up and down from hitting the potholes straight on, it doesn’t matter if this god awful car gets ruined. It’s simply a pizza delivery car anyway. It’s headlights flicker through the dense fog. The car continues, then stops altogether. The headlights go out and suddenly darkness surrounds me. I sigh and slam my head against the steering wheel, then grab the flashlight and phone sitting in the car seat next to me. Opening the door I step into the night."

    Summary
      As she sat at her desk, she felt her own eyes boring into her back, the feeling of right but wrong rising in her chest once again. It was like finding a toy after losing it for months, but there being something off about it. The stitching was out of place just so slightly, the color just a tad darker or lighter. Wrong.
