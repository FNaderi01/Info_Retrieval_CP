    Summary
      The couples nearby had all stopped talking to stare at them, and Isabelle barely held back an eyeroll. If they thought their gawking was subtle, they had another thing coming for them. “Although I’ve noticed quite a few pretty girls are in attendance tonight.”
“Oh? And you’re interested because…?” Isabelle asked innocently, although her eyes were already flitting from woman to woman in search of a potentially attractive individual.
“I’m not interested and you know it,” Alec chuckled, nudging her slightly when the music started and Isabelle failed to start leading. “However, I know a certain sister of mine has a thing for gorgeous girls with just enough confidence and a good amount of charm.”
Or: Isabelle meets Clary at a Winter's Ball.

    Summary
      “We should have dinner,” he blurted out, regretting the words as soon as they left his mouth. If the alarmed look on Alec’s face was anything to go by, he was just as enchanted by that idea as Magnus was. Which was to say, not a lot. “Oh come on, it could be nice! You could invite all your siblings, I could invite all of mine, and we would all spend a wonderful evening together. I have a feeling you would get along well with Ragnor, and you seem to think Isabelle and I would hit it off immediately. What could possibly go wrong?”Alec snorted derisively, and Magnus grimaced. Alright, so a lot of things could go wrong, but now that the idea – however distasteful – had popped up in his mind, he wasn’t going to let it go until his boyfriend agreed to hosting the family dinner of the decade.Or: Magnus and Alec meet their partner's families.

    Summary
      When Isabelle and Lydia had told Clary that she would finally get to meet the mysterious Alec, brother and boss to the two women she loved, Clary hadn’t been sure what to expect.The man was a crime lord, the leader of a dangerous organisation that killed people and did all sorts of illegal things. He was probably the deadliest person Clary would meet in her life, and she had no idea how to handle that. However, he was also Isabelle’s brother, a man who was apparently caring and attentive and always ready to save his siblings from whatever disaster they had caused. That, she knew how to handle.Or: Clary finally meets the infamous Alec Lightwood and tries her best not to screw things up.

    Summary
      The shower washed the soot off in dark streams. Watching the dirty water flow into the drain, Alec thought of the bottom of Rafael’s feet. Stained black from dirt. He had a feeling that Rafe would not like bathtime. And though he had yet to be bitten by the boy, (Who had a reputation of doing so) that might all change tomorrow morning during bathtime.

      “However, there are still plenty of people out there who would think your siblings are worth less than them purely because of who they date. I think they’re incredibly strong for dating the people they love despite it all. However, I think your actions are also admirable in their own way. Shadowhunters aren’t raised to accept difference.”
“No, they’re not,” Jace agreed under his breath.
Or: Jace doesn't always understand his siblings' relationships, but he'll always support them.

    Summary
      They’re sitting together peacefully when something occurs to Clary.
Alec is lounging against the tree, eyes closed and a small smile twitching at his lips. The redhead’s head is resting against her brother-in-law’s shoulder, feeling more comfortable with him than she does with almost anyone else.
“When did you start liking me?”

    Summary
      In 2035, a violent storm forces NASA's Ares III Mission to Mars to be aborted but during the evacuation, Isabelle Lightwood is hit by debris and lost in the storm. The last telemetry from her suit indicates no signs of life. Believing she is dead and in imminent peril themselves, her crew take off to return to their orbiting vessel, Hermes. But Isabelle survived and has just made contact with NASA. Now the race is on for Alec, one of NASA's astrodynamicists and Izzy's brother, to find a way to rescue her. With everything stacked against them, including their own mother (NASA's Administrator) refusing to authorise a rescue mission, there's only one company, one person with a rocket that could launch in time - and it’s owned by Magnus Bane.Can Alec convince him it’s worth the risk? And what will he have to give him in return if Izzy is brought home safely? For shaumonday's week 2: space au.
