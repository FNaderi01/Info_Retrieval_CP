    Summary
      Arago after the final fight is just a body laying in the sand, letting wave after wave crash over him, drag him, push him.
He's alive, though, at the very least.

    Summary
      This boy needed more warmth in his life, and by the gods she was going to give it to him. And if her kids ended up with a loyal older brother who would do anything to protect them? Then it was an unexpected and wholly unnecessary bonus.
Rating &amp; tags will be updated as story progresses (when it finally progresses)

    Summary
  "You ever just wake up one day," Harry said in the most conversational tone his Aunt Petunia had ever heard come out of that mouth of his. "And say to yourself," he continued as he looked up from the flowerbed he was weeding for her. "Why the hell should I even bother?"
  And Petunia frowned at him. "Now you see here boy-" she started but he interrupted her.
  "I mean, what's the point of it all?"

    Summary
      Kakashi came back from death seemingly unscathed.  Kakashi is also extremely good at hiding physical, mental, and emotional injuries.  Every man has their breaking point, though.  Maybe he didn't want to come back after all.
