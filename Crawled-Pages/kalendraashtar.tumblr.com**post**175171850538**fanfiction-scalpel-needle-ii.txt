                            Fanfiction - Scalpel &amp; Needle II
                            Scalpel &amp; Needle(Arc I: Incision), Previously
Scalpel &amp; Needle IIPart II - RibcageThe fact that Claire was standing in the middle of the living room,
half-dressed and tousled - cursing and hissing in search of a pair of missing
sneakers, bloody hell - when the key
turned on the lock of the front door, was nothing but a fortunate coincidence. She stood there, with her mouth half-open in perfect surprise,
paralyzed by the unforeseen sound. At first Claire almost didn’t recognize him,
and for a brief moment her brain contemplated the frightening - and most
certainly shameful - hypothesis of being robbed while not wearing any pants. His face was gaunt, as if the earth that was his body had quickened
and shifted, building valleys and lines - rivers really, for there must had
been water running down aplenty over those high cheekbones - to reshape his
features. His body used to talk of physicality and strength, but those generous
lines had turned into whispers of malnutrition and exhaustion, even hidden as
they were underneath a battered black t-shirt. 
For once he didn’t seem larger than life, instead thoroughly consumed by
it. Fragile. Helpless. That mere thought broke her.Jamie.The inventory continued, flooding her brain within the next two
heartbeats. As Claire’s blood hummed through her aortic valve, she realized he
had clipped his hair very short, probably for practical reasons, and even his
usual vivid red was dulled.  Tap, her tricuspid valve closed,
preventing reverse influx – oh, to go back
back back, not in the chambers of the heart, but in time – and his blue eyes seemed almost the same, not quite, just enough.Her throat had become uncapable of forming sounds, Claire could have
sworn, such a complex mechanism forgotten just from the sight of this stranger,
that was also the man she loved. “What are you doing here?” She managed to ask, stupidly. All other
things running inside the fast tracks of her mind seemed to be too overwhelming
to be put into words, so there was security in trivialities. In a second,
Claire might comment on the weather. Slightly
chilly for the season, and the rain they are predicting for the weekend, such a
bummer.“I live here.” Jamie answered softly. He sounded hesitant, almost
fearful, as if there was a chance that he might have the wrong address after
all. “I didna ken ye’d be here.”“I stay here…sometimes.”
Claire gulped down, her fingers squeezing the solid fabric of her shirt against
her thigh. This time she suspected he was real, because not even her
imagination could conjure up such a change in his demeanour. “You cut your
hair.” She offered, perhaps her lips even arched on a timid smile, cutting away
any harshness. “I had to.” He brushed it with his fingers, that coppery grass, a
gesture akin to the way he used to muss it up when he was nervous. “Lice, ye
ken?”“It suits you.” Was that a lie? Or something that became truthful in
the act of saying it, dreams made flesh, words made actual opinions after
uttered? “Why didn’t you call, telling me ye were coming?” Claire asked,
seeking his cobalt eyes with her own.Why didn’t you call to tell
me you were alive? Why didn’t you call to tell me you loved me again? Why
didn’t you call, damn you? Jamie licked his lips – chapped from too much heat and exposure –
and slowly placed his backpack on the floor next to his feet. It was thorn and
slightly dusty, from sand blown half a world away. He swallowed hard, lightly
tapping his fingers against his leg.“I thought –“ He started, but his reasoning was spectacularly
interrupted by a lightning bolt of gray fur, running into the hallway like the
miniature of a raging bull, tail armed like a feather duster. The small cat
looked at Jamie with ghostly green eyes and meowed unpleasantly, admonishing
the intruder. “What is this?”“Adso.” Claire kneeled and
tried to grab the fluffy feline to greet his host, but he amiably – and quite
regally – pawed at her hand, avoiding capture. She clicked her tongue in
frustration, but the kitten glanced at her with amused condescension. “I got
him as a gift to you – happy belated birthday, by the way.” She explained
haphazardly, as the domestic cat sprawled on the floor, his front legs crossed
in a graceful manner, like a lenient king about to hold court. “You’ll get
along just fine.” The female surgeon finished chirpily and Adso seemed to
almost smile under his whiskers, silently promising they would not. “Ah, well – thank ye.”
Jamie looked suspiciously at the new alpha-male of his dominions, detachedly
licking his right paw, leaving the two peasants to their conversation. “Claire.” He breathed out and his voice
reached out to her like an open hand, the yearning stretching as five open
fingers, ready to touch her. Claire. He sounded just as he did on that missed call. Absolutely lost and absolutely in love with her. With a whimper, Claire startled and moved to him. She doubted her
ability to kiss him without crying, her tongue trapped inside the cell of her
teeth in sobs that would wreck her body, so instead she placed her palms open
against his chest. Real, real, real,
his heart chanted brokenly with each systole and diastole. “I missed you, Jamie.” She sighed, her
voice unhinged.Jamie’s arms came around her then, with painful urgency, and he
squeezed her into the body that was now his; the softness of her breasts, free
under her sleeping shirt, pressed against the hollow spaces of his ribcage;
they felt like a fence, one she might invade by jumping over a plank, in order
to reach the paddock where his heart rested. His waist felt bony, his iliac
crests like rising mountains against her own, the strangeness of their sameness
striking. His fingers dove into her hair, pulling delicately, her curls
travelling on his fingers like riotous waves on grainy sand. Claire wasn’t sure
which one of them sobbed in bliss, both too eager and afraid to give away even
an inch.While anger was present in her mind - yelling demanding questions
that started with “why”, “when”, “how could you” -, it seemed to pale in comparison to the joy and
longing that assaulted her like a gut punch. For the moment, he was enough. With a decided hand, Claire started to undress Jamie, biting her
bottom lip at the sight of his changed body. Every softness filled by good
meals, lazy mornings of lovemaking and dawns of working out had been erased,
mercilessly replaced by bone, tendon and a fine layer of hardened muscle. Jamie
had become a scalpel in more than name, sharpened to a point where it hurt to
touch him.Her lips searched his skin, tracing the bold lettering of his tattoo
with the tip of her tongue, reassuring herself that some things might yet remain
the same. Jamie was opening her shirt, his thumbs grazing her hardened nipples,
touching her necklace again and again, as if he couldn’t quite believe she had
kept it in his absence.When their lips finally found each other, they were desperate and
reckless with each other, almost brutal; pain was good, pain was a relief, as they were only able to feel it because
they existed again in the same place, at the same time. That pain meant they
were together and no painkiller could
take it away.The tips of Claire’s fingers felt small new scars all over his body;
a map of stories he hadn’t shared with her. Maybe the tip of a blade just above
his left kidney; maybe a lost shrapnel just underneath his shoulder blade. Were
there any names carved there, in the slightly golden and sunburnt skin? Would
she find people living there too, more real to him than her?“Ye’re beautiful.” Jamie
said in a husky voice, fondling the curve of her buttock. She growled in
response and bit the curve of his neck, wishing to insert herself into his
bloodstream. They slid to the floor together - scaring Adso, who threw them an
annoyed look as he waddled towards the kitchen. Limbs groping and securing,
half-finished touches like half-finished conversations, until they were almost
joined.  “I dinna have a condom.” Jamie was breathing fast and superficially,
tracing the outline of her face.“Your bedroom.” Claire tasted his upper lip, sucking until he
hissed. With a demonstration of residual power in spite of his slimness, he
lifted her and carried her to his old room, now made into her den. There were
surgical notes on the nightstand, a ring with a blue stone on top of his
dresser and two white sneakers peeked from underneath the bed. Jamie laid her down on her stomach, her arms outstretched above her
head until her shoulders threatened to escape their joint, as her hands were
trapped inside his calloused fingers. He was covering her with his body,
perhaps shielding her away from things she couldn’t yet see, that he had
brought with him from his mission; but the fact that he had chosen to take her
without looking into her eyes wasn’t lost on her either. As he entered her, his
breathing came hot and moist against the back of her neck, and Claire almost
dissolved into the mattress. He didn’t last very long, only enough to make her come with such
intensity that his name seemed to be carved behind her eyelids, made of red ink
that blotted a little. Then he yielded too, Gaelic
streaming of his mouth like he had forgotten all other words, reduced to
the simplicity of his first years. Jamie’s cheek was against her spine, bone
calling to bone, and the moistness she felt could have been sweat, but maybe
also tears.Eventually he rolled his body off of her and Claire could glimpse at
his face, where his eyes remained lively and tender. His hands sought each
other, fingers playing and battling like little creatures. It seemed unbearable not to touch.  “Will you tell me?” Claire asked him, her voice hoarse. “About your
time in Syria?”“I’ll try.” Jamie answered, nodding slightly. “Some things – might
take some time. I dinna have words yet to describe what I saw – and did – there.”“I know you told me not to,” The female surgeon said haltingly,
caressing the curve of his shoulder. “But I saw the news. It must have been
incredibly hard.”“At first I thought – well.”
He smiled weakly, as if he was somewhat embarrassed. “I thought I was ready for it and that I would make a real difference.
That was verra presumptuous and naïve of me. The first few weeks after I went
to Raqqa were so terrible it all felt
– unreal. Like watching a movie
without the ability to press pause.”“I understand.” Claire touched his short hair, which prickled her
palm. She had ghosts of her own, of course – her parents, Uncle Lamb, Frank, Ewan and Firouz, only to name the most
notable ones. But she was also beginning to think that the ghosts following
Jamie had turned into an endless crowd during his time away, able to block away
his vision of the ones still living. “But Jamie, are you back now? Are you – home?”“In the early days I did what I could to survive and help others.”
Jamie explained in a hushed voice, kissing her temple. “And one day I reached a
point where it all seemed…natural. It
became the everyday life, as watching rugby or going to the Royal Infirmary used to be.” He looked
away for a moment, his face distant, flying over continents. “And now I’m here
and this doesn’t seem real at all. I want verra badly to be
back, but I don’t know how, yet.”Claire swallowed hard, fighting back tears. “That’s alright. We have
time.” Thank God, time together was
still a possibility. With the gift of time all could be restored. “I love ye.” He whispered fervently. “That is the only certainty I
have left. The only thing that never changed.”And she believed him. But as Jamie drifted off to slumber in her arms,
Claire wondered about the secrets weighing so heavily on his heart, preventing him
from smiling in his sleep when she touched him.
