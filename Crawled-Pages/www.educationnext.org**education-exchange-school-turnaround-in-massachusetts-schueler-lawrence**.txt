            State interventions to improve struggling local school districts have a mixed record, but in Lawrence, Massachusetts, a state takeover seems to be turning things around.
Paul E. Peterson talks with Beth Schueler about her new report, “School District Turnaround: Learning from Leadership in Lawrence, Massachusetts.”
Jeff Riley, the state-appointed superintendent who led the turnaround in Lawrence, will be Massachusetts’s next education commissioner, the state board has announced.
