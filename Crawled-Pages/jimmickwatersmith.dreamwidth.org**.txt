Flavored Seltzer WaterJan. 28th, 2016 03:00 am
I got a call from a wrong number today.  Usually I don't pick up unattested digits, but I gave it a chance because it was a 516 and because of reasons to follow.  Although I usually ignore calls from strange numbers, there was the knowledge all day, given what's been going on in my life right now, that I'd answer my phone even if the caller ID showed 8======D.Bad example, I would never decline a call from 8======D.Any way, I picked up and it was a doctor, or at least a man who gave himself that title.  I couldn't make out his surname at all but the conversation went like this, pretty much :Me: Hello?Doc: Hi, this is Dr. [Pasqual]Me: I'm sorry?Doc: Hi, this is Dr. [Pasqual]Me: Who are you looking for?Doc: Todd Cincinnati.Me: I'm sorry, you've got the wrong number.I should have oh so yes-anded that shit. I could have pretended to King Cobra snake-bite victim and area code 516 resident Todd Cincinnati.I got a voicemail once from an older Jewish lady trying to reorganize a bridge game, and if she couldn't get people together, her chances of playing were over, and of course it was just a run-on sentence like this of her talking, the way it would be for anyone, but some people take longer and she was one of those, so at least four times she mentioned that they need to get together or else there's no tournament.  And it broke me heart.

I picked up, off the street a few minutes ago, what is, literally, the biggest clue I've ever found: http://www.flickr.com/photos/27854613@N03/sets/72157623634589283/It's like a classroom roll-down transparency of Africa and southern Europe, but just the borders and country names.  So I guess teacher would pull down a geographic map and then pull down this transparency over it to reveal the politics.  This is a great find.  I'm really excited.  I've just got to clean it up some and I've got myself something.For the first time in so long, I didn't close by myself at work.  So me and my coworker and his girlfriend went to a Mexican restaurant after work.  There were actually two Mexican restaurants side-by-side, at the intersection of Roscoe and Clark.  One is  pretty authentically Mexican, and I've always wanted to eat there because it looks nice. The other one is lit like a nightclub and was blasting "Party Like a Rock Star" by Shop Boyz when we walked by.  But it has a huge, gigantic sombrero protruding from above the storefront.  Giant things, esp. sombreros, are fucking awesome.  But there isn't a sombrero large enough to convince me to eat at a Mexican restaurant that plays music in the key of Shop Boyz. http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=roscoe+and+clark&amp;sll=41.973431,-87.667744&amp;sspn=0.007115,0.01266&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=N+Clark+St+%26+W+Roscoe+St,+Chicago,+Cook,+Illinois+60657&amp;ll=41.943743,-87.653748&amp;spn=0.000222,0.000396&amp;t=h&amp;z=21&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=41.943743,-87.653748&amp;panoid=2qiDysm7KcGZkT9tWSp9Cg&amp;cbp=12,45.49,,0,-6.75Fiesta Cantina on the left vs. El Jardin on the right.  Guess which one yells shitty music at you while you enjoy tacos and margaritas?  We went to the other one.   I had the salad and Christie and Ryan shared fajitas.  Though we heard, loud and clear from next door, what we were missing while we ate, at least we were missing it.Christie and Ryan couldn't finish all the fajitas and didn't want to take the leftovers home.  So I said I would.  But now I feel, like, guilty about not asking them again if they didn't for sure want to take them.  I agreed, almost too hastily, not mainly for the free food, but because I didn't want the food to go to waste, you know?  I should have asked them if they were sure.  Plus I forgot to thank them for letting me take their table scraps.  I don't know why the fuck I get so bothered about things like this.  There they were, ready to discard a good portion of untouched and reportedly delicious food, with the billions of people in the world starving, and I swooped down from a rooftop of good deeds on wings of altruism and say "yes, I'll take that."  Yet I still feel guilt.I should be rewarded for taking that free food.Then walking home from the bus, I found the transparency.Hello LiveJournal.

I realized I love movies when I was at David "Lars" Lieberman's house watching Boogie Nights with Lars, David Miljoner, Brooke Dairman, et al.These were the smart people. Well, these were the achievers. They were in the honors classes. Yeah, they were smart. I was not especially smart, nor did I achieve much.And I was there with them, watching Boogie Nights... a movie we were watching who knows why, which we wouldn't be able to fully enjoy until we learned more in life. But we were watching it.Up until the climactic "bell scene" we chuckled at the pornographic parts and giggled when reference was made to Dirk Diggler's big penis.  We watched the brilliantly choreographed opening shot without regard for its precision.  We watched Mark Wahlberg sob and drool as he divorced himself from his mother and father without acknowledging how we'd feel in a similar situation.  Somehow we made it through Alfred Molina's dynamite unaffected.Then came the scene. Where the frayed plot lines get tied back together by the repeated striking of a single tone on a bell.Ding ding. Jack Horner lures a stud into his limo, a man on the street who will make film history on video tape with Rollergirl; and they end up beat the shit of him. Ding ding. Dirk gets jumped by a dude in a baja sweater and his gay bashing buddies. Ding ding. Don Cheadle is the last man standing in a shoot out at a donut shop, where all he wanted was to buy bear claws for his woman. My eyes are wide open. My jaw is dropped. I've never seen anything like this before in a movie. I want to cry. I want to turn to the people with whom I'm sharing this beautiful moment and concur that this is a beautiful moment.And they're somewhere else. They're nowhere near.  And it'll be years until I join Nonsense and find film compadres.It might have been Awakenings or Searching for Bobby Fischer or The Rocketeer, but might also have been Boogie Nights that made me love movies. I dunno.

Sometimes when I get like this, I'll look back at my old entries.  I like the way I used to write; it was a kind of funny way to write.  Seems like times were bad at the time, but I envy those days.  Who knows why.  I was smarter back then, I think.  I'm pretty stupid now and getting only stupider.This was my entry for Thursday, September 13, 2008:"I got promoted at Best Buy to Media Senior. I do exactly whatever I did before, except now I make $13.50 and work full-time hours. Also I have the authority to tell my coworkers what to do and they come to me for executive decisions when the supervisor's not around. If you ask me, it's a pretty sweet deal. I just can't show up late or still drunk from the night before.I've been at BBuy for two years now. That's some time. I'm well-liked and respected there. But I have no intention of staying there or in this very state much longer.My plan is to move to Chicago and get a job doing something. I need a big change. I need out of this house.I need something else to write about."So there I was and here I am.  With nothing else to write about.I'm not doing too good for myself.  My favorite time is when I'm asleep.It snows here and it's cold and I spend too much time alone.

Egg cartons have a "best by" date printed on them. What I'd appreciate more is a "worst on" or "inedible after" date. Because you can't tell with eggs until they're cracked.I miss my mom's cooking so so much.

I feel lonely. It's never a great way to feel. It's such a boring feeling. I want it to be the future, where things have already happened and things are different. It'll probably be better then because I'll have snapped out of this mess. I'll be smarter then. I'm so dumb now. Look at these sentences. Look at how short and dumb they are. Dumb, dumb, dumb. And fucking boring.I can't believe I was ever confident in myself. I had a dream of two sky-writing planes crash landing into Lake Michigan; it was spectacular. And a few nights later, I had a dream about a lobster-sized scorpion that was equal parts terrifying and annoying.Anyway, how's everyone else doing?

Spending money on you makes me want to cum.May. 30th, 2008 04:38 am
When we were young, Russell Bailyn and I were good friends. Russell was a hoot; nobody made me laugh more than he did. He was the youngest of three brothers; Evan a year older and Bradley two or more. His parents were divorced and he and Evan lived with Lisa, short for Melissa, Bailyn in Oceanside not too far from me. We both went to School #8, but weren't friends until 6th grade with Mrs. Krasnoff, nee Sontag. Russell gave Mrs. Krasnoff such a hard time. She would raise her voice at him to a point that scared the rest of us, but he was still a pain in the ass. It was great.I wasn't always ready to admit to others that I was friends with Russell. He was nuts. He sat in the front row, his desk covered in Barney stickers with the inset of Janet Jackson's self-titled CD (the one where she's topless except for a pair of hands covering her breasts from behind, a hot one) propped up around the perimeter. He ogled the picture right in front of Mrs. Krasnoff and drew his own version with unconcealed breasts and an extra hairy bush instead of pants. One day he pushed Stacy Brecher across the room and into a metal cabinet. He got in a mess of trouble for that. Instead of apologizing to her, he said he'd put a jumping jack in her vagina and light it. He pushed Josh Kurot so far that Josh brought a knife to school and threatened Russell. Josh got suspended because of it. That's hilarious.His father, Arthur Bailyn DDS, and Bradley lived in Great Neck. His father made a lot of money being a dentist, and shopped wholesale even though it was just him and Bradley in an apartment. Huge jugs of Hawaiian Punch and big things of peanut butter. For Russell's birthday one year, Dr. Bailyn treated me, David Miljoner, Lee Bergstein, and Russell to a night of fun in New York City. This included dinner at Jekyll and Hyde--a sort of PG-rated Chuck E. Cheese--and a helicopter tour of Manhattan. Dr. Bailyn's girlfriend came with us, appropriately aged and wearing a fur coat.I don't think Lisa Bailyn dated much. She wasn't unattractive, but I think the stress of raising Russell took its toll on her morale. They didn't get along. Sometimes it was uncomfortable being over his house because of the screaming matches they had. But Lisa liked me, I reckon. I was polite.Russell had a tent in his backyard where he had a stash of porno magazines that taught me as much as they confused me. I didn't understand why all the women spread apart their vaginas; it looked like that would hurt. We used his Zippo to make marshmallows taste like burnt paper and lighter fluid, set one end of a small length of twine and tried to smoke it. I didn't bother to ask how he got the Zippo and porn and stuff. I suspect he either stole these things or used his charm to persuade crooked Oceanside Flea Market merchants. One day he had cigars for us. We walked around the neighborhood smoking them while Russell fired rocks into the air with his slingshot and off in the distance something would break. Lee Bergstein's dad drove by and saw us with the cigars, and for the next couple of days I had that dizzying childhood fear in my gut that my mom would discover the horrible thing I'd done.In middle school, Russell and I only shared Mrs. Fazio's orchestra class. I played violin, not poorly but without virtue. But Russell was a talented cellist, second only to the effeminate and overweight Jeffrey Brous whom Russell relentlessly tormented. He really let Jeff have it. He loved the cello. While I played whatever they put in front of me, Russell bought his own sheet music and practiced stuff he didn't even have to know. Once he showed me a composition he wrote, hundreds of notes written in pen on looseleaf paper. Then he played it for me. An hour later I finally stopped laughing.Somewhere during high school he moved in with his father and finished school in Great Neck. We're friends on Facebook, and apparently he's a sort of financier now. I hope he's making at least one person's life difficult. That would be funny.

I went home this past weekend to turn 26. It's been just about three months since I moved to Chicago. I liked home, but not entirely, which is just about how I feel here. Long Island is a familiar place for me, and familiar places are comfortable. But if I wanted to live there, I'd be there right now.Chicago is still, for the most part, unknown to me. So is living by myself and not having close friends close by. There's still a lot I have to get used to. I have to work on getting comfortable.My new Best Buy is fun. It's smaller. I have friends at work, which is great. I got promoted last week, over people who have been at this store for years longer than I have. It's flattering, really.  And as much as I hate missing what I might be missing, I've got this job in the mean time to give me money and health benefits and people to know. I'm here now.Want to hear something cool? At my new Best Buy there are two new things: a place for customers to leave CDs and DVDs they've picked up but don't want to buy, and an endcap for employee picks. This morning I was going to add the album "Visiter" by The Dodos to my employee picks, but couldn't find it in the music section and so figured we don't carry it. Hours later, I happened to glance at the "Don't want it? Leave it here" rack, and there was "Visiter" all by itself. So I gave it a new home on my endcap, next to the movies There Will Be Blood and Idiocracy and The Friends EP by WEEN. It was such a coincidence, that CD being there. One that matters most to me and none to anyone else.It was so long ago that I made this, about two and a half years, but I finally got it on youtube thanks to a handsome gentleman named Clay Byers who shall remain unnamed.It's called Going Nowhere and becomes more and more flawed upon repeated watching, so just give it the once over. I'm almost kind of sure that making movies is probably what I might want to do with my life, maybe. But who even knows. There's always Best Buy...I'll try to get my other one up too. But after that, there's nothing else until I make something.

ONE FLAT SHEETApr. 21st, 2008 11:17 pm
My hair, after a certain length, can not be tamed by any means I've tried.  It defies gels, sprays, and pomades, can't be combed or brushed to any end but mess of hair atop a misshapen, abnormally small skull.  That's where my hair is right now and it makes me awfully self conscious.  If I were more of a man, I wouldn't care about it at all.  If I were less of a man, I would spend more time doing something about it.  I just want to look good, is all.  Organized hair translates to clean hair.  There are heads of hair that always look unkept and unclean.  Mine is one of those.  People notice and respect a sharp head of hair.  I know there's more to my going unnoticed than a sloppy coif, but it wouldn't hurt to have sweet do.It's somewhere between wavy and curly.  Thick is what it is, real thick.  My sideburns curl upwards at the arms of my glasses into fruity wings.  There's a rebellious flock of strands front and center that wants nothing to do with the rest. And it grows unevenly, fastest on the sides and slowest in the back.  After about an inch in length, it does whatever it wants.It was straight until puberty started, and since then I've wanted a normal head of hair.  On the late bus after Biology in 8th grade, somehow the focus of conversation was directed toward my hair and how it could be puffed into an afro.  Whichever girl was in charge, I want to say Melanie Werner but I'm not sure, wanted to see how big my hair could get, so she started asking around for a hairbrush.  I didn't object.  It would be good publicity, I thought.  Of all the insecurities I carried with me at the time, many of which I still have, my hair was by far the least and I was willing to exploit it for a good laugh.Anyway, Melanie or whoever asked around for a hairbrush; she really wanted to see my hair in an afro.  And she asked Jenny DiOrio.  Jenny had a brush, it was obvious in the way she looked when asked.  What was obvious only to me was that she really didn't want that brush to touch my nasty hair.  She warily gave it up, and as Melanie or whoever prompted me tease my hair out with Jenny's brush, I could see the look on Jenny's face get more and more distant.  It's more harsh when you can simply sense another person's disgust for you than if they express it verbally.  And in this case, it was loud and clear to me that Jenny didn't want her hairbrush running through my hair.  I bet she threw it out when she got home.Jenny was so pretty too.  She's the girl who turned me on to wide hips and plump asses.  She had big, sleepy-looking sexy eyes and a pleasant smile between thickish lips.  I bet she's still a knockout.  And I was the shortest kid in middle school.She really didn't want me using that hairbrush.

Best Buy Core PhilosophiesTreat customers uniquely and honor their differences--as segment and individuals.Invite employees to contribute their unique ideas and experiences in service of the customer.Meet customers' unique needs, end to end.I've lived here for a month now. From time to time, especially in bed trying fall asleep, I miss being in my familiar place. It's cold here. I wish it warms up soon; I'll be so much more comfortable then. It gets really cold in my apartment; the radiators are on a timer, I guess. And when they finally turn on, they give off an awful hiss that taunts me when I'm awake and wakes me when I'm asleep. So I turn them off and it gets cold again. But it'll warm up soon and I'll be better because of it.I just hate going for days without seeing someone I'm used to, if not good friends with. It's going to take some work getting familiar with the people I see every day.And the Russians that live above me are up to something, I know it. I just know it.

This is my desktop wallpaper:I've had it up there ever since I had a bad dream about the terrifying Megalodon months and months back. It's the wallpaper I had up when the Comcast guy set up my cable and configured my Internet a few days ago. I wonder what he thought of it. He's the only other person besides me who's seen it on my desktop. Until now, he and I were the only people who knew I even had it as my wallpaper.I forgot to tip him and I've felt really bad about it ever since. He did a lot of work too. I wish I had tipped him.To make up for it, I tipped the guys who delivered my couch way too much, which was stupid of me.Sometimes I mess things like that up quite often. It's stupid.

( I wrote this about a month ago.. )All told, I made around $300 in MYSTERY BOX sales. I think some people still owe me money.I live in Chicago now, for as long as I can. I haven't gotten a job yet. But I've only been here one week, so I guess there's time. Except for I'm starting already to feel the hurt. I'm supposed to have a job lined up at the Best Buy here. I've called them twice with no response.  I don't particularly feel like trying to find a job elsewhere, unless this Best Buy pays me shit. I guess they have the same position available at the one I want to work at. I was Senior of the Media department, that's right. I reckon I can get by on what I made at the store in NY. I just need to get employed here in order to make money, obviously.But other than that, what a smooth transition it's been. My place is really nice and I'll probably take pictures of it soon. Today I took great strides in making it look nice because I assembled the furniture I got from Ikea yesterday. I finally got all my DVDs out of the boxes and onto a shelf, which makes me feel at home. I don't have a DVD player, go figure, but I can watch them anyhow on my computer.Today I ate a hamburger at a place called Kuma's Corner. The waitress looked like Juno and she had the same spunk. I think she liked me.  Kuma's Corner is really good for burgers. All in all, the food is great here.My neighborhood where I live is called Andersonville. There's plenty to do here, see for yourself. It's probably about 40 minutes by train north of the Chicago Loop, where all the buildings are. But that's the way it is here. I like it a lot so far.My friend Gena has been helping me a lot. I don't think I'd be able to handle this without her.I drove here, from NY, with all my stuff in my car, and it was fucking hell. Pennsylvania had snow all over it, to the point where you couldn't see anything, including the lines and dividers, for about 10 hours. There was a plow whose claw was sparking up something terrible, and I was stoned too, so it living nightmare. At one point there was a car facing traffic, having spun out, righting itself with a u-turn at like three o'clock in the morning for god's sake. I'm glad that's over. I really am.I've only got two more boxes of stuff to unpack. It's my books and my other stuff. I've got to get more furniture, including a computer desk; I'm sitting on the floor as I type this. A laptop would be cool, but hey.Wish me luck. If you need me, I'll be in Chicago.

Lotion pour le CorpsJan. 23rd, 2008 04:04 am
( Here are a few of the album covers I like )My lower lip is slightly swollen and hurts.  Last week I bit into a bagel with chapped lips and my lip cracked and bled a little. Since then, there remains a fissure which tastes like blood. And when I squeezed my lip with my fingers moments ago, some white stuff came out, almost like a pimple. Can you get pimples on or in the lip? I don't know.So that's something gross about me. I found a 50 dollar bill on the ground at Best Buy on Sunday. I spent half of it on 5 movies on sale this week for $4.99. They are Sliding Doors, Clue, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, and Amistad, which I've never seen but brings me closer to owning all of Steven Spielberg's features (though I can't see myself purchasing either War of the Worlds or The Terminal). So now I have 396 titles, including television shows, in my DVD collection.I'm proud of my collection. Of course, I owe its size to the fact that I work at Best Buy. But especially to the fact that I work Sunday mornings, preparing the department for each week's ad. For the most part, sales on movies are kind of lame. But there are a few good ones, which I usually go overboard with. Seasons of Seinfeld for $16.99. Simpsons for $19.99. BOGO on two-disc Oscar winners. $6.99 Horror and Christmas movies during Halloween and Christmas, respectively.I'll admit there's some junk in my collection, a few bad apples which, after what will probably be hours of deliberation, I will part with whenever I move. Something tells me I don't need Garden State gaying up my shit anymore. And that something is good taste.I've got work in one hour and forty-five minutes. Should I try to get 45 minutes of sleep, or should I masturbate to Gwyneth Paltrow's fake British accent in Sliding Doors? We all know what I should do. No one, not even me, knows what I will do.

My friend Phil who works in the Computers department at Best Buy once said he gets happy whenever we work the same shift because he knows he'll laugh at least once that day. I mean, it doesn't take too much to make Phil laugh. But it was one of the better compliments I've gotten at work or anywhere.I've bought more presents for myself than for anyone else this Christmas, including this. I don't feel bad about it either.
