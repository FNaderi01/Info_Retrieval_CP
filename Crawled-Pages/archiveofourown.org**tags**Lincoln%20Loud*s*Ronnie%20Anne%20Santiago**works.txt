    Summary
      A collection of bite-sized stories for fandoms I consider myself to be in or to have been in. Expect a wide variety of fandoms, including ones I haven’t written for before! (P.S. I’ll add fandoms into the tags as I post chapters containing them. Also, I will put the rating for each story in its summary, so check that. The rating for the overall post will only get as high as the ratings for the individual stories end up getting, so if one of the stories gets an M rating-not that I'm saying that's very likely-then the whole post will be rated M. We good on that? OK, then.)

    Summary
      Loan wasn't sure exactly what drove her to seek out her Uncle. She needed to get away, yes... but she'd only met the man twice before. And yet, for reasons she couldn't understand... she trusted him. And for reasons HE couldn't understand, he felt an instant bond with the girl. Neither could have imagined the horrible truth that had remained buried for twenty-one years.

    Summary
      Lincoln Loud was always known to be the 'ladies man', but he also has a secret that he never revealed to anyone. He also has a weird obsession over male fluids. Having an uncontrollable urge to pleasure himself is one thing, but having a crush on both his best friends Ronnie Anne and Clyde is surprising to the Loud boy. Rated "M" for mature and sexual themes for adults.
