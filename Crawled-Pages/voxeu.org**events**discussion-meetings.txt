The global economy is climbing out from the depths to which it had plummeted during the Great Lockdown in April. But with the COVID-19 pandemic continuing to spread, many countries have slowed reopening and some are reinstating partial lockdowns to protect susceptible populations. While recovery in China has been faster than expected, the global economy?s long ascent back to pre-pandemic levels of activity remains prone to setbacks.
Join Francesco Grigoli, Florence Jaumotte, Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti, Damiano Sandri, and Beatrice Weder di Mauro in this joint seminar on the IMF's latest World Economic Outlook.
