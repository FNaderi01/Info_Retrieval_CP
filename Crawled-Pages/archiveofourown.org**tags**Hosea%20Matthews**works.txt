    Summary
      Tessa Evangeline "Evie" Locke is a wealthy woman, with a wealthy father, with a strong passion for adventure, and a strong disliking of waiting around and being bored to death by the suitors her father introduces to her. Sure, she loves needlepoint, but just like her mother, she wants more than a life of domesticity -- and a life that's more than domesticity is exactly what she's going to get.

    Summary
      Kinktober 2020, #10: "Accidental Knotting"
The tension between you and John had been driving the entire gang up a wall.
Granted, at the time the ‘entire gang’ had consisted only of you, John, Arthur, Hosea and Dutch. But the sentiment remained the same.
Ever since you’d presented Omega he’d been sniffing at your heels - well, even before then, if you were being honest. Arthur had pulled him aside, threatened his hide if he were only after you because you were an Omega, and he’d avoided you for a few weeks, then there he’d been again following you like some love-struck pup.
Dutch and Hosea had made bets as to when the two of you would get together - and Arthur had been furious when he found out he’d been left out of the pool. Though they’d always dragged you out to a cabin or hotel for your Heats, threatening his manhood if he so much as looked your way during it - they were in no position to be tending to a pregnant Omega or caring for pups.

    Summary
      Arthur Morgan was many things... a sharp shot, a con man, an expert thief, rotten to the core. However, he had also been a father that could not provide or protect... a lover that didn't meet expectations. Love never seemed to go the right way for him. But maybe, just maybe... it was because he hadn't yet met the woman destined for him. She is just as ferocious as she is beautiful, and will love him so deeply, that he'll question everything he'd ever known. God will not allow the golden-hearted to walk the Earth alone.

    Summary
      Sheyanne was rescued long ago by a man she now knows as her closest friend, John Marston himself.  But that love soon turns to something else while she's in a relationship with none other than notorious gang-leader Dutch Van Der Linde. The relationships take turns over and over again, fighting for different reasons. She's soon caught up in a love-triangle that turns to shit over time. She may just be on the wildest ride she could only dream about, except its real. Realer than you can get.

    Summary
      You never expected to live past your next birthday, let alone get magically sent to the 1890's. Nevertheless, here you are, stuck a hundred and twenty-ish years in the past... and in the care of a group of outlaws, at that. But as you slowly learn to make a life for yourself, you realize that maybe--just maybe--it isn't all bad. Maybe you can finally start living, not just surviving... something you never thought you'd have.Oh, and then there's Arthur. He makes things a bit more complicated. Feelings and all that.Arthur Morgan x Modern!Reader. Heavily based off my Modern!Reader shenanigans on Tumblr.
