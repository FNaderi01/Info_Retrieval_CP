Compton Unified’s Regis Inge Wins CA League of Middle Schools’ Educator of the Year Award            
				By Sentinel News Service                
	                	                Published December 10, 2015

In his more than 20 years teaching Compton students Regis Inge has positively impacted countless lives, and for him that is more than enough reward for his work.
Because of his dedication to supporting young minds, Regis is the recipient of the California League of Middle (CLMS) Schools’ Educator of the Year Award.
“One thing I’ve learned about Compton students is that they need someone who will tap into their gifts. Underneath whatever they might be going through, they are talented,” he said. “My top three things are that they know how to write, read, and speak well. From there they can do anything.”

Regis, who currently teaches social studies, world history, and English Language Arts at Willowbrook Middle School, accepted the award, Thursday, November 19, at CLMS’ Educator of the Year awards ceremony in Woodland Hills.
He has a Bachelor’s degree in Elementary Education from Tuskegee University and a Master’s degree in Special Education from National University. His mother Janice Inge taught in Compton schools for 24 years.
Throughout his time in the Compton Unified School District (CUSD) Regis has committed himself to helping students discover their potential to succeed academically and even professionally.
“I remain connected to many of my former students. I’m grateful to know many of them have gone on to college, to careers, and became somebody,” Regis said.

Former students include a chef working in a Paris restaurant, business owners, health care professionals, educators, professional athletes, and one of the biggest artists in today’s music landscape — rapper Kendrick Lamar, whom he introduced to poetry.
However, Regis said his main goal is to guide students towards their academic and professional goals.
“One of my objectives with my kids is to teach them to be independent and prepare them for college or career tech. I’m prepping them for the next level,” he said. “I don’t just lecture or tell them what they need to learn. I guide them so they learn through research, critical thinking, and analysis.”
“I don’t believe college is the only path towards success. There’s career tech too. Some of our kids might want to cook, so we’ll research Le Cordon Bleu. Some might love drawing, so we’ll explore graphic design,” he said. “You don’t have to go to college but you should be certified in something you want to do.”
Regis also challenges students to present what they’ve learned and discuss it with the class.
“In the real world, as professionals they will have to share their ideas. They must learn how to communicate effectively in a professional and academic setting,” he said.
“Some of these kids might go on to become doctors. They’re going to need to properly explain what is wrong with their patient. Or if they become mechanics — what is wrong with their customer’s car.
