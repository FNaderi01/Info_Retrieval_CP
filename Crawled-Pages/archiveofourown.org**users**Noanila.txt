    Summary
      Many years had passed since the sun rose again. Ignis, Gladio and Prompto were reborn with vague memories and met up in every life. The only gift the gods granted them with. Except Noctis. He hadn’t been reborn at all. His soul was the price they had to pay to make the sun rise again, after all. So it was lost. The three made peace with it after a long period of grief and held their dear prince in their memories. Until this century. Something was different. They could all feel it when they first met up in this life. Noctis was out there too. His old magic hums in their veins, inaccessible yet comforting. It felt more intense the closer they were to him. That’s how they ended up here, in Insomnia once again to find their missing piece.

    Summary
      “Hello,” Shuuichi says carefully, because despite the depths of spiritual energy, he can’t help but be reminded of a scared deer in the way the youkai is standing so perfectly still. “I didn’t mean to startle you.” When the spirit doesn’t make a sound, Shuuichi presses onward, feigning ignorance. “What’s your name? I’m Natori Shuuichi.” “...Natsume Takashi.”
