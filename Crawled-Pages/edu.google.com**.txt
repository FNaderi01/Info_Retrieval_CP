    Students deserve every opportunity to succeed in computer science
    Learning skills in computer science helps students thrive in a rapidly changing world. That's why it's our goal to make sure everyone has access to the collaborative, coding, creativity, and technical skills that can unlock opportunities in the classroom and beyond.
      Code with Google
          “By involving students in creative lessons that allow them to express their ideas, coding becomes much less intimidating.”
              Tim Hilborn, Technology Teacher, Abbott and Borel Middle Schools
          “Technology alone will not improve education, but it can be a powerful part of the solution.”
              Sundar Pichai, CEO, Google
    Projects to help close global equity gaps in education
    Technology is transforming teaching and learning. It’s helping kids learn at their own pace, become creative problem solvers, and effective collaborators. But for those without access, existing learning gaps are only widening. That's why we’ll continue directing our products, people, programs, and philanthropy toward a future where every student has access to the quality education they deserve.
