when i woke up this morning, my first thought was ‘no one visits my grave anymore’ and i was really sad for a few minutes so i lay on my bed with my eyes shut and then all of a sudden i opened my eyes and was like ‘wait i don’t have a grave what the fuck’

3YOI Future!Verse ABO AU - Clothing Set#01 - Yasha Katsuki-NikiforovI think sometimes you can learn a lot about a person from their clothing choices, and I’ve always sorta wanted to make some fashion sets ^ ^ So I’m making one for the OC kids, starting with the eldest as usual, Yasha! (He’s probably pre-teen-ish around here, maybe, idk)Yasha still more or less thinks of himself as a boy (when he can be bothered to think about it at all) but loves flowers, pastels, and anything soft and gentle (in harsh contrast to his blunt as a bludgeon personality). And most importantly, he kinda just really hates wearing pants and underwear, when he can get away with full nudity… He takes the young!Victor flower fairy aesthetic to the next level. He can be very picky about what he wears, and usually prefers expensive but relatively unknown specialty brands. His parents, especially Victor, are more than happy to indulge his tastes.~~IF YOU ARE NEW TO THIS AU: It’s a Yuri!!! on Ice AU, Yuuri-centric with end-game polyamory in an ABO 
setting, Yuuri gets married to four mates (Victor, Yurio, Phichit, Minami) 
and they have OC kids.This post features the Victor x Yuuri kid, Yasha.BASICS and timeline of this AUINTRO to how ABO works in this AUA SUPER DETAILED world-building headcanons post on ABO+ in this AUOTHER POSTS (comics + illustrations) in the Future!Verse ABO section of my YOI Masterpost.~~Please keep ship bashing out of the comments/tags.

in retrospect the only musical group that has the potential to be more iconic and critically acclaimed than ABBA is Big Time Rush
