    Summary
      In practice, love is a curiosity that must be approached with caution. For you may find yourself fully embracing it only to be betrayed by it a moment later. If, after a time, you allow it back into your life you may discover it has changed it’s nature entirely. So much so that you might not even recognize it at all. But perhaps the strangest thing of all is the power it has over you. Like the power to lead you down a path you would never have explored on your own.

    Summary
      Jung Hoseok is forced to move back in with his parents after he loses his job due to cut backs. Whilst on his way to an interview, the strange cab driver drops him off at the wrong place, some old Laundromat. He ends up with a night shift there at a fantastic rate. The old woman warns him to not accept any gifts and to not climb in the dryers… He really should have listened to her. When lights start flickering and the same dryer door repeatedly opens on it’s own, he calls Jungkook, terrified the place is haunted. Which is ridiculous… right? One day he finds a strange carved cat after falling asleep at work. He takes home the wooden cat and begins having bizarre, erotic dreams. Then, whilst working in the creepy Laundromat, a primitive creature slithers out from dryer 6, dragging the horrified Hoseok into an unknown, strange land through a dimensional portal in dryer six. Everything is strange and new, but nothing is more baffling than Jungkook showing up!Statuses(Breeds): Alphas: Hoseok(Human/Canine), Jungkook(Hare/Canine) – Omegas: Yoongi(Pure Bred Feline), Jimin(Feline)Other characters: Namjoon(Feline), Taehyung(Merman), -rarely mentioned- Seokjin (Primate)

    Summary
      Once again, I'm back with a debatable writing decision! :D I've fallen headfirst into yet another fandom, and if I don't get it out of my system, I'm probably going to lose it. This fic is for all kinds of reader-insert requests for the Hypmic boys. If you have an idea for me, leave it in the comments! The meaner, the better. &gt;:Dc I have a variety of fun Aus for the picking from, and I hope everyone enjoys my extremely specific brand of torturing pretty boys. Expect pain, angst, fluff, and most likely smut as well~

    Summary
      If My Hero Academia and Hollow Knight was a single AU, what would that look like? Bug and human societies merged many years ago, the Pale King ruling over bugs, but then another rival, the Radiance rose up, wanting to rule in a different way. Radiance and All for One would have teamed up, the Hollow Knight, along with All Might and many others, seal away The Radiance in Hollow Knight and kill All for One. Or did they? By the time Izuku and a new, younger vessel named Hollow )after its predecessor), are ready to become heroes, infection begins to spread, and the chant to free the source of the infection begins. It's up to them to stop the spread and save humanity and bugkind, and become true heros!Will put warnings on graphic chapters! Because of these scenes I've changed the rating from T to M.Please note: After some heavy consideration the parts heavily based on the Anime itself won't go past season 3, and diving into the "original" Hollownest will begin after the "last" episode of season 3, so to speak. I wanna finish this fanfiction, after all, and a lot of people will die.A crossover based on My Hero Academia (the anime) and the Hollow Knight Video game.
