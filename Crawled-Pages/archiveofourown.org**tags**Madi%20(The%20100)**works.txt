    Summary
      Clarke was told that Lexa had died in combat 5 years ago. What happens when Lexa came back to save her? How is she alive? Where has she been? What really did happen to Lexa during the 5 years when she was thought to be dead? 
I sucked at summary. So if that little summary intrigues you, please be sure to try and read to find out. :)

    Summary
  Lexa never really thought she would see another human being other than Clarke after the apocalypse. Not that she was complaining. By all means, she and Clarke were the last people standing on the face of Earth, save for those floating in the sky and thriving underground.
But there was a child. A Natblida child, gawking at her like she couldn't believe she was the last true Commander. Or, Lexa and Clarke both survive Praimfaya, and meet a small but ferocious Natblida in Shallow Valley.

    Summary
      Takes place after the series finale. Same universe as "Transcendence is Boring" and "Memories." Don't have to read the others to follow along, but you may enjoy them.It was ironic, really, to think about how their little group was the last bit of humanity the universe would ever see. There would be no future generations to prepare for – no legacy to leave behind. Well, there was a next generation. They would truly be the last of their kind. A generation that consisted of one 12-year-old girl and two teenage boys. It was almost funny if you think about it.

    Summary
      First chapter is a prologue on how Lexa survives 3x07.Season 3B happens the same and Becca helps Clarke in the CoL not Lexa in the Season 3 finale.Season 4 happens exactly the same.Lexa and Clarke find each other in 5x01 at Shallow Valley.Each chapter is an episode of the show from then on. Im trying to write this to be as close to canon as possible. The endgame will be the same (except we get Clexa happily together on that beach)

    Summary
      This series is an Alternative Story, where Lexa didn't die. She was "only" shot into the shoulder. It's going to start when Clarke is climbing on the transmission tower to activate the ring of the ark. Just imagine in all the things that happend between Lexas's death and the ending of season 4, Lexa was standing in the background and being Clarke's moral compass. I will try to update it at least every two weeks.

    Summary
      What if the commanders were able to transcend? The flame may have been destroyed but the information on it never was. This is a rewrite of the 100 finale (mostly the clexa scenes) because I think they missed a lot of opportunities with the finale. It will have the same ideas (characters still transcend), but some aspects will change as well as showing what their newfound peace will look like. Disclaimer: I do not own any of these characters this is my adaptation on an alternate ending for the 100.
