    Summary
      At the rate this year was going then Regulus was going to become an alcoholic by the time summer came. And it was all Sirius' fault.But that still didn't solve the mystery of how he got into Hogwarts in the first place. But he knew someone who probably did have the answer.Or: how Regulus addresses a plot hole that I found in POA and inadvertently proves his brother's innocence far earlier than in canon as a result.

    Summary
      There’s a man gazing intently at one entry in the potion catalog—inquire for custom orders. And Loras just knows he’s come in to ask for a love potion of some sort. A shame, really; he was just Loras’s type. “We don’t do love potions or any other magical aphrodisiacs here,” Loras firmly explained. “No need to be putting another date rape drug on the market, y’know? Not really the kind of image we want to build for ourselves.”
