    Summary
      Oikawa Hayami thinks she's all set for her third year at Nekoma High School. Fleeing to Tokyo from Miyagi in order to escape her past, she succeeded for two years without batting an eyelash.
But when her basketball club gets shut down and she's forced to become the manager of the boys volleyball team, she realizes that not everything (and everyone) in her life is bad... and that she can slowly learn how to trust people again without hurting others all the while.
And its all thanks to Kuroo Tetsurou.

    Summary
      "Matsun got his legs to move, because these ‘things’ had spotted him. He ran past the fallen and crying people on the floor, ignoring the grieving mother crying while holding her child, only to be attacked and bitten in the neck a few seconds later. Issei corrected himself: these things were definitely zombies, and from now on, he would refer to them as such. Man-eating zombies. He shouldn’t have gotten out of bed today. He regretted it already."

    Summary
      Daichi had thought college would be simple, or at least easier than high school. He wasn’t pursuing volleyball, and it’d never occurred to him that he could end up meeting old rivals outside of the sport.That was, until he found out his roommates were all former rivals, and the captains of their own high school teams.It was /supposed/ to be simple.Or, Ushijima keeps bringing home plants, Oikawa’s spa days and Bokuto’s movies are a weekly thing now, Kuroo keeps leaving his experiments out and Daichi just wishes they’d stop messing with the thermostat.

      The day the annual Tokyo training camp ends, Bokuto Koutarou is kidnapped. With no way of getting home, his chances lower when he's sold and transported to a different country where he knows nothing and nobody in this new place which is supposed to be his jail until he's sold again or dies. But it looks like even with the light in his eyes becoming dimmer and dimmer, lady luck still feels like pulling a few favors for him. Whumptober 2020 | Day 2 | Kidnapping

    Summary
      Akaashi Keiji had nowhere to go.Kuroo Tetsurou had extra space.Bokuto Koutarou was flexible.Kozume Kenma should’ve chosen better roommates.When Kuroo found something unexpected on a patrol, he volunteered without telling his roommates. So you could imagine their reaction when he came home with a child unannounced. Kuroo thought it'd be okay. Bokuto wanted to be friends. Kenma wanted to know how to take care of a child, because if he didn’t do it, who would? They started from nowhere, but they’ll grow from there.

      After graduation, Sawamura Daichi doesn't really know what to do. Out of all the Karasuno Volleyball Club third-years, he's the only one to leave the area for college, and that to Tokyo of all places. Having accepted that his life is probably be pretty lonely from now onward, he doesn't expect to have not one, not two, but four roommates who just so happen to be the captains of formal rival volleyball teams. And it turns out that besides helping each other with their loneliness, volleyball, and school, there are more things that bring the five unlikely friends closer together.
