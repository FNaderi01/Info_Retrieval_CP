    Summary
      A different take on the MHA universe. What if Izuku Midoriya actually had a quirk? What if that quirk was similar to OFA, only it didn't leave his body broken to the point where it couldn't be healed? More importantly, what if his quirk was similar to All Might, because of one reason........If he was related to All Might? Join Izuku Midoriya as he starts his journey to become a great pro hero, with the help of friends, family, and a beautiful round faced girl. Armed with a quirk known as Power Stack, Izuku Midoriya trains hard to become the next symbol of peace! This story is co-written with Ragnark517 on Wattpad

Now she's struggling with the internal guilt and weight of her mother's death and absolutely no where to go. Kirea Todoroki isn't a quitter and she will keep going until she sees the stars.

    Summary
      "It's safe to say that your son isn't going to develop a quirk."Thise words changed Midoriya Izuku's life completely.Abandoned by his father, ignored by his mother, bullied by his childhood friend and everyone else, he refuses to give up his dream to become a hero.However, as time passes by, he becomes more and more secluded and falls into a dark abyss of depression.Even after he miraculously gets a quirk at the age of eleven- he's already too broken and afraid to use it.Then life changes for the better.Attending U.A. with a quirk passed on to him by All Might himself, Izuku couldn't be more happy- on the outside.The truth is that his mind is shattered and his quirk is draining him both physically and emotionally. When he snaps and looses control over his quirk in the worst situation possible, what will he do?

    Summary
      “Stop it Kacchan, you’re hurting him!”When Midoriya stepped in to defend that kid, he’d been expecting the inevitable beat down. Expecting to be bruised and battered and crying, but he still stepped in.What he didn’t expect was for six little girls to jump to his defence. He definitely didn’t expect them to stick around longer than that.But they did, and now Izuku had six guardian angels. Six girls he wouldn't trade for the world itself.

    Summary
      He didn’t want to die.Oh no, Izuku definitely didn’t want to die. He was far too scared for that. He had no clue what came after death.———————————————————Alternatively: The only reason Izuku might still be alive is spite, and sometimes he runs dangerously low on that.
