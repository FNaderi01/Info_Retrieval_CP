It's only been two months since I was last here, I'm improving!Anyway, books!Mostly I am back to reading the Foreigner series. after a long gap over the summer. I'm up to book eight now, Pretender, and they continue to be excellent. Cherryh's worldbuilding is amazing, to the point where I actually gasped over one character calling a different character by a certain honorific, because the implications of that were a) big, and b) something that I understood because her world and her societies and her characters are so complete. I am constantly delighted by these books, they are so good. ( Spoileriness )I do have several library ebooks that have just come in, including Jeannette Ng's Under the Pendulum Sun, so it's probably time for a shift in gears for a bit.

 The two books I've finished recently inspired very different reactions in me. The first is The Feather Thief by Kirk Wallace Johnson, which inspired a lot of anger. So much so, in fact, that I remembered I could go be grumpy here about it a good six months after I last made an entry (so far I have also raged about this to my parents, my partner, and three friends, and I am probably not done yet).The book is an investigative journalism/true crime look at the theft of 299 birds (including a whole bunch of birds collected by Alfred Russel Wallace when he was wandering around ruminating about natural selection) from The Natural History Museum at Tring, stolen by Edwin Rist, a flautist, who steals them to a) make stupid salmon flies out of (not to actually fish for salmon with, oh no! This book reveals this whole world of people tying Victorian Salmon Flies, which are idiotic salmon flies made with feathers from incredibly rare birds, basically for the aesthetic, because there sure isn't any actual advantage to making your fishing flies out of Bird of Paradise feathers as opposed to chicken feathers, and also none of these people are actually fishing with these flies anyway, they're just making them and showing them off), and b) to sell them to other people so they can make these stupid flies and so he can buy a gold flute.( Spoilers and also anger and capslockiness )And the second book I read was - luckily - not about true crime, fly tying, or people gutting natural history collections, but it did involve crime! Murder, in fact. What Angels Fear by CS Harris is a Regency England murder mystery that gleefully embraces all tropes of the Regency England murder mystery genre (this is a very specific genre, I grant, and admittedly I have only read three series in it, but so far all of them have hit most of these tropes, so I'm reasonably confident calling them tropes). I also spent the entire book trying to work out if it was going to do a genre switch from 'historical murder mystery' to 'fantasy historical murder mystery' by introducing vampires. ( Spoilers on the vampire front follow )

...let's pretend it's still Wednesday, shall we?I am now onto the third Blood Ties book, The One With The Mummy. The titles of this series are kind of hilarious: Blood Price, Blood Trail, and Blood Lines, so far. I understand sticking with a theme, but while the first title made sense (blood sacrifices were involved!), the second one (which is The One With The Werewolves) wasn't particularly relevant at all. I'm not far enough into Blood Lines to tell you if it's a good title or not, but I think these titles might be a case of sounding out which words sound suitably dramatic when paired with 'blood'. Anyway, they're still good fun, I'm enjoying them a lot. I'm not wild about the love triangle that's being set up, but my grumpiness about it is slightly ameliorated by the fact that everyone involved is also incredibly grumpy about ending up in a love triangle. They're surprisingly queer for books published in the 90s that aren't specifically &lt;i&gt;about&lt;/i&gt; being LGBTQ; lots of one-off characters are casually in same-sex relationships, and both our vampire hero and our ex-cop heroine are bi, which is cool. (I went and looked up Tanya Huff and it turns out she's married to a woman, so I guess that explains that, but it's still really pleasing, and I'm glad she was able to publish them!)I'm also excited to drop by the library tonight and pick up Let's Talk About Love by Claire Kann and Love Medicine by Louise Erdrich! New books! Me remembering that the library system exists and I can use it to get books! The first is a YA ace romance with a black main character, and the second is... I'm not actually entirely sure, but it was recommended by a good friend, so I am looking forward to them both.I have still been woefully neglecting Precursor, which I'm about four pages into, oops.

ReadingI actually haven't finished anything since last week, or proceeded very far in Precursor (the fourth Foreigner book) which I'm going to choose to blame on a five day fieldwork trip. But I did start the Blood Ties series by Tanya Huff while in the field, as I was far too tired to have the brain for Precursor, and it is delightful. She is obviously having the best time ever writing it, so I am having a fantastic time reading it: there are vampires! crime! Toronto! The vampire in question is the Henry Fitzroy, illegitimate son of Henry VIII, because why not? Grand idea! He keeps having entertainingly Highlander like dramatic flashbacks and I am so on board for this. Vicki the human ex-cop wants to fight everything and I want her to get to because she's awesome. Celluci the human cop is torn between being tired of everything and wanting to fight it. Tony the human guy-on-the-street is clearly going to become more involved over time. Almost every character we meet is both hilarious and great (and most of them seem to be bisexual, so that's really refreshing). It's a lot of fun. WatchingStill Highlander! Still less beheadings than I was anticipating, but Who Wants To Live Forever was used during a Sad Angsty Moment and I was delighted. Duncan continues to embody a romance novel and it's still the tropiest thing ever. I do want more flashbacks than the show is giving us, though, because I love dramatic flashbacks, and also because I enjoy Adrian Paul doing terrible accents and sporting various quantities of facial hair. I'm looking forward to when they go to Paris for the second half of the season, where I hope things continue to be just as ridiculous. (Look, I am a very easily pleased individual, it doesn't take much to entertain me.)ListeningStill on The History of Rome! I'm now in the Late Republic, so maybe I'll hit the year 0 sometime before the summer. Also I've been listening to a lot of Camille Saint-Saens, who did delightful things like The Carnival of Animals, which includes a glass harmonica, a truly bizarre instrument (the trouble with me listening to things is that I get distracted and start looking things up, so I had a happy twenty minute detour into the history of the glass harmonica, which was not what I was supposed to be doing at all).

I have seen a bunch of people doing Reading Wednesday, so on that note I am going to test out using Dreamwidth to help my goldfish brain remember what media I am consuming! Also I like to think this might help me read more, which is a goal I have decided I am going to achieve this year.( So: )
