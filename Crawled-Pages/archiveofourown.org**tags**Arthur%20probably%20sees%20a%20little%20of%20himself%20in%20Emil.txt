    Summary
      Emil didn't want to be here, not in this country, not in this house, and not in this school. but here is his and he cant change it. but maybe that cute blonde kid that sits in front of him will change his mind. follow Emil as he tries to get through school, a crush(because that's what it is) and meeting up with old ex? uh oh.
