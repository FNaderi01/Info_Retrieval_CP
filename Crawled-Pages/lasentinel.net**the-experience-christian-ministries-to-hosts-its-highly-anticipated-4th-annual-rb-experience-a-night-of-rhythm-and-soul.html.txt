The Experience Christian Ministries to Hosts its Highly Anticipated 4th Annual R&amp;B Experience – A Night of Rhythm and Soul            
				By Sentinel News Service                
	                	                Published September 13, 2018
		Members of the Faith Community Come Together to Celebrate a Night of Love Songs.
Coining the phrase “Out of the Box, but in the Word,” The Experience Christian Ministries (ECM) in Los Angeles, under the leadership of multi-Grammy award winning R&amp;B and Gospel songwriter and producer, turned Pastor, Shep Crawford, continues to live up to it’s reputation. On Saturday, September 29, 2018, the progressive church will host its 4th Annual R&amp;B Experience at 5:07p.m. at ECM located at 326 E. 47th Place, Los Angeles, CA. Admission is $15 in advance and $20 at the door.
“This is one of our biggest and most anticipated events of the year!  We spend a lot of time in production and putting things together to make it a memorable experience for all. We selected songs that we feel speaks of the love God intended to be enjoyed by man and wife. We also selected songs with great, positive and powerful messages that will encourage everyone,” says ECM’s Minister of Music, Aireah McClain.

The standing room only event showcases some of the most talented individuals and groups in the faith community and attracts music lovers of all ages, walks of life, ethnicities, denominations and religious beliefs. While it entertains it also ministers and challenges the myth and traditions taught throughout generation after generation that say R&amp;B Music is the “Devils Music.”
“For so long we have heard that R&amp;B music is the “devil’s music” particularly from the Black church. The first love song was written and recorded in the Bible by a man named Solomon between 971 &amp; 931 BC. With his wife responding to his love Solomon wrote these lyrics in Songs of Songs 3:4  (The Woman) “I threw my arms around him and held him tight, wouldn’t let him go until I had him home again, safe at home beside the fire” and Songs of Songs 4: 5-7 (The Man)  “The lines on your smooth neck command notice—all heads turn in awe and admiration! Your breasts are like fawns, twins of a gazelle, grazing among the first spring flowers,” and it goes on throughout the entire book of Song of Songs, says Pastor Shep.
He goes on to say, “These lyrics are in the Holy Bible because God is the author of romantic love between man and woman. Now, if God inspired these songs and allowed it in his personal book written to us, why then would it be forbidden to sing in his house if its in his book?”
Some of the songs that will be performed by Pastors, Ministers and other Christians will include: “Through The Fire” by Chaka Khan,  “Love Is Stronger Than Pride” by Sade, “Outstanding” by The Gap Band,” Love Like This Before” by Faith Evans, to name a few. Performers include: Pastor Michael Saunders – Beacon Light Baptist Church, Sr. Pastor Stanley Richard, Alex Arowora, Praise &amp; Worship Leader at Antioch Church of Long Beach, Sr. Pastor Wayne Chaney, LC &amp; Heirfore Laweta Crawford directress of Greater Los Angeles Cathedral Choir, Connected, Various praise &amp; worship leaders, Pastor Shep Crawford &amp; Dr. Crawford, Sr. Pastor &amp; First Lady of The Experience Christian Ministries and more
In conclusion Pastor Shep says “I believe that if Christians were the ones writing R&amp;B music, we would have more “Ribbons In The Sky” and encourage couples to “Stay Together” while knowing “Nothing Can Come Between Us” letting our spouses know that even1000 kisses from them is “Never Too Much” because “I Will Always Love You,” and “Your Love Is My Love” which makes our love timeless and an “Endless Love.” These songs, along with the rest of God’s Word, can help couples make it through The Rhythm (Good Times) &amp; Blues (Bad Times) of life, whether times are good or bad, happy or sad.
My prayer is that Christians read the entire Song of Solomon (aka The Song of Songs) and realize that it is Christians who should be writing, recording, and celebrating LOVE SONGS, and not leaving it to the world to bastardize it.”
