                                                    Hello Tumblr people, My birthday is on Thursday, October 08. Everyone had been so kind to me this past weeks because of you I was able to fixed my brother’s tablet and I was able to buy a touchscreen phone for my part time job. I’m so greatful that I want to share this blessing on my special day. I’m here to ask donation not for beer money but for food money. I want to make a pack lunch - spaghetti and bread, and share it to my neighbors kids, people who works hard and those people who cant afford to buy a meal.If anyone can donate, your $1 is big enough to make 1 kid or an adult to be happy on my birthday. I’m a kid at heart and I really love making kids happy. Please help me be the happiest on my special day. Thank you all so much! ❤paypal.me/marieklaar

I need some help, any kind of help. I know this is not a nice timing to ask help because I know everyone right now is suffering because of the pandemic but I really need help for my family, specially my youngest brother and not-so-healthy father. My brother is just 8 yrs old and our parents separated when he was just 5. When they separate, my other siblings stays in our relatives house because my father can’t support their education. Im the one supporting my father and brother but I cant afford it anymore because its very difficult to find a new job right now and I just do part time cooking job. Can someone help us get food supply and help me pay some of our bills nuntil I get another job please? And when it rains it really pours, my phone was broken as I do part time cooking, as of now the phone I’m using is my cousin’s to post this. My phone is the only way I can communicate with my costumers, can someone help me fix my phone or help me buy the cheapest touch screen phone so I can upload the food I sell please. (I tried charging my phone and it still works but the screen is nor working anymore.)This is the sample pics of what I sell and send to my costumer. P.s. I was funded for my for my brother’s tablet in my post weeks ago, he is happy he have a device to use for his online class on October 5. ❤

As we dont have any tablet or laptop available for him, He once had a tablet but the LCD was broken and if anyone who is willing to sponsor its repair I will be glad to accept it. I am the one supporting my brother as our parents are separated when he was just 5. He is now 8 years old and an incoming Grade 2 student. I dont want him to miss this school year just because I cant provide for his educational tools. Please help me fulfill my duty as a sister to my brother, as our parents is no longer supporting us. 😢 I will owe everyone who will reblog, comment and donate to my post..

I know this not a nice timing to ask help because I know everyone right now is suffering because of the pandemic but I really need help for my family, specially my youngest brother and not-so-healthy father. My brother is just 8 yrs old and our parents separated when he was just 5. Im the one supporting him and my father but I cant afford it anymore because its very difficult to find a new job right now and I just do part time cooking job. Can someone help us get food supply that will last till the lockdown end?Im a suicide survivor trying to live a new life and Im trying to fill the responsibility my mom left when she leaves us for another man, I just want to provide for my brother, his needs, his education but this pandemic happens.I dont want him to feel the sadness, I always felt for him. I pity him a lot. I love my brother so much that he is one of the reason Im still alive. Of course, Without God I am nothing but God gave me reasons to live and that includes my family and my brother.Please if you cant donate can you please reblog for me please and my direct message is open to have a chat with someone who is a survivor and has the same situation as mine.paypal.me/marieklaar

                                                                OKAY but like the woman is a super famous sculptor herself. Two major players in their own respective industries and they don’t know it! What are the chances? Life is amazing!
                                                                sheldrakus
                                                                Ok, so I flipped back through the notes to find the name of the artist who isn’t Jay Z - she’s Ellen Grossman and it turns out her work is massively cool! She makes drawings and sculptures that look like delicate lace or something, but are actually based on topographic maps and scientific data - ‘the sensuous aspects of water currents, land masses and the wind made visible’. I THINK SHE MAY BE A WIZARD. Anyway, check it out - ellengrossman.com
                                                                soulofasub
                                                                It’s amazing that this woman is famous in her own right, but just for a moment I wanna point out that when she didn’t know the man next to her from a hole in the ground, she was still so immediately all about his success.  “I’m proud of you.”What a great person.
                                                                durnesque-esque
                                                                Some of Ellen’s work. 
                                                                audrey-hepbae
                                                                I think she’s proud of him for taking the train despite being wealthy enough to never use public transportation again. So it was a real recognize real moment.
