    Summary
      They’ve both always taken it a little too seriously, being in charge. Yeah, it’s a frat, but to Percy it’s acceptance and to Jason it’s proving to his dad that he can be a leader even if he doesn’t want to go into some soulless accounting position.(or, Jason and Percy are president and VP, respectively, and they're just friends, no matter what the rest of the e-board keeps muttering behind their backs)
