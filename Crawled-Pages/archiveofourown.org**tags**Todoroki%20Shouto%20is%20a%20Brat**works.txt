Very recently, this secret has cost him his relationship and his job. Finding himself in a new apartment with a new job, he is bound and determined to get it right this time around. However, all of this is quickly thrown into question when he finds that an old childhood friend, Izuku Midoriya, works for the company he's joined - in the same department, even.

    Summary
      "We're going to be together for a very long time, you know." Izumi murmurs, and Shouto blinks, startled out of his reverie. When he looks at her again, he finds the most alluring smile on her face, and his breath catches."Are you happy with that?" Shouto asks despite himself, voice small."Of course, Shouto." Izumi says, cupping his cheeks. "Oh." Shouto says, smiling widely despite himself.(or)After nine years of friendship, and two years of love, two pining idiots finally tie the knot.

    Summary
      It starts with Keigo having a bad day, segues into Kacchan blowing his top, and features a cameo of Izuku trying his best to help, and failing. It ends with a worried parent coming home to a tangled mess he can barely make sense of, and trying his best to fix it. Shouto didn’t set out to hurt anyone, but all actions have consequences, and no punishment is more effective than having others suffer for your mistakes.

    Summary
      “In the time since they’d done away with the truce, things had been easy. They’d been living together, killing together, and fucking whenever they could get the chance. Things were simple, they still had their moments—tiny arguments and bickering, mostly over how they should do jobs, but they couldn’t exactly expect everything to be picture perfect. And that was just fine with Katsuki.”Three months after the events of Sabbatical , Katsuki and Shouto have settled into their post-truce life as boyfriends. But when the two villains uncover the secret Deku has been hiding, they’re left to team up with an unlikely ally to stop him. How will Katsuki fare against the quirk that almost killed him, and what could he lose along the way?

      After having been injured in battle, King Enji decides that it is time for his youngest son to succeed him, but first he must find a suitable omega to wed in accordance with the kingdom’s laws. However, what should be a simple union is made vastly more complex when Shouto chooses Inasa—the person who hates him most in the realm. Loyalties are questioned and tensions run high as Shouto and Inasa travel to aid the Northern Kingdom against unseen foes, navigating their forced relationship and unveiling a sinister plot along the way. What sacrifices must Shouto make to deserve the title of king? And when the battle comes... will he be able to survive it?

    Summary
      The reason he'd taken Shouto under his wing was for the sole purpose of pissing their father off, but it isn't long before he starts to question if he'd made the biggest mistake of his life, he has no idea how to help anyone but himself nor does he expect to grow any kind of attachment to Endeavor's favorite child, until he does, and that just makes things ten-times harder than they need to be especially with someone like Shouto who could be as dense as a brick from time to time.

    Summary
      When she died at 27 years old, Sasagawa Kyōko thought that was the end; but the Multiverse wasn't done with her.Midoriya Izuku didn't understand why she was a "creepy" &amp; "strange" toddler; her understanding of everything kept getting contradicted by what she experienced in her daily life.1 thing was certain, though; this adult reborn as a child would do all she could to become a Pro-Hero...

    Summary
      Todoroki Touya spent the majority of his life questioning: who was Todoroki Enji? His father never said anything past him going to U.A. and deciding to not become a hero, yet Touya was still left wondering. Nevertheless, Touya created two missions for himself: (1)become a hero no matter what and (2)find out what his dad was hiding.Along the way, he was met with a spoiled, bratty baby brother, two other siblings who teased him every chance they got, typical strict parents, teenage rebellion, and a trail of red feathers leading him to a pretty bird. Let's just hope he doesn't keep getting grounded(spoiler: doesn't work out).orHappy Todorokis AU with Tik Tok references[Slow updates because I'm a slow writer lol]

    Summary
      Five years into Pro-Hero life for Class 1 A has had its ups and downs.When Deku, the new Symbol of Peace, approaches him with his newest pipe dream of opening his own Hero Agency to honour the legacy of the fallen All Might, Bakugo is all for it.  But when he finds out Todoroki has gone AWOL and has been MIA for some time now following a major fallout between him and his father, Endeavour, Bakugo is left wondering why he can't get the guy out of his head. Especially considering the terrible circumstances in which the two heroes had parted ways after U.A graduation, that he would really rather forget about.After a chance encounter during a villain attack, however, does Bakugo get a glimpse at just how not okay the ice and fire user is......and that just leads to a chain of events that neither hero was prepared for.

    Summary
  "Do you know, for example, what 'yeet' means?"
  A pause.
  "I don't think that's a real word."
  "I don't think you are qualified to determine that."
  "You are one goddamn annoying little shit, you know that?"
  "You hired me," the little shit throws the ugly truth in his face, lifting one perfectly sculpted eyebrow. The red one, just as stupid as its white counterpart. 
By the age of 28, Bakugou Katsuki is the CEO of the most important haute couture company in Japan. Alas, age and experience did not to prepare him for the human shaped disaster known as Todoroki Shouto; his youngest employee, the new Social Media Specialist that seems set on pushing all of Katsuki's buttons at once. Multiple times a day. With dynamite sticks.Who will cave in first – the pompous brat or the aggravated senior citizen?

    Summary
      “They’d had this arrangement for over a year now, been fucking out their mutual frustration once a week, every week and not any old vanilla fucking either—the raw, animalistic sex that always left one or both of them bloody and begging for it to end.”Katsuki and Shouto are villains who want each other dead and spend each week actively trying to kill one another—well 6/7th of the week. On Sundays they take a sabbatical, a 24-hour truce where they devote their energy to other forms of stress relief.

    Summary
      TdDk, ABO, Fake Relationship, Quirkless AU. Sugar baby-daddy vibes, lots of Fluff, drama, and shenanigans. Shouto is forced to find a mate or lose everything. Izuku has to somehow come up with the money to pay for his tuition or risk being kicked out of his medical program. The solution to these problems? Pretend to be engaged long enough to get what they want. But what happens when feelings start to get in the way and these two realize their fake relationship is a little too real?
