    Summary
      The Galar Gym Leaders have always been a close-knit group, becoming more like a family once they got to know each other.Piers, however, had always been an enigma. They already knew he's a kind-hearted individual (despite his moody exterior) that prefers to take care of Pokémon and his little sister as well as writing songs over attending flashy events Rose would made them go to. However, other than being the Gym Leader of Spikemuth as well as the boss of Team Yell, none of them knew much about him.To think that a hacker that made his way to Raihan's group chat was what lead them to find out more about Piers.

    Summary
      A... different telling of Pokémon Shield.  When a dragon, a literal dragon, shows up in the Galar region stuck in his alternate form and with no explanation, he starts a journey to discover how he ended up here and if there is a reason for it.  Along the way, he may learn that the ones around him might know more about his presence than they reveal.

This journey of self-reflection not only serves as a turning point for herself, but for the lives of others that weave and intersect with each other.Latest Chapter: Chapter 14 - Target (Raihan convinces Juliet to infiltrate the Power Plant to get answers, but she discovers more than she bargained for.)

    Summary
      I’ve been writing this to myself, I never planned on publishing it since it’s not meant to be a “serious”project. I work on it in my off time. It’s the Pokemon sword and shield storyline, but the reader is the protagonist, they are really shy and when they are endorsed they don't believe they can do the challenge at all. Until they put on a mask and choose a fake name. They have to hide from everyone they trust and go through the highs and the lows alone, while keeping everything hidden. Anyways, I hope you enjoy reading.TW: Anxiety, Low self esteem, child neglect, su*cidal implications

    Summary
      Five rookie trainers enter the Gym Challenge, each with their own goal in mind. Only one will fight their way to the top of the League and earn a chance to become Champion!Of course, we've still got a long way to go until that happens. Let's see what they get up to along the way, shall we?A partial rewrite of Sword and Shield with Victor and Gloria both existing and not being silent protags, Slice of Life hijinks, and Marnie not being criminally underused in the story. There may be relationships at some point, but not as the central focus.
