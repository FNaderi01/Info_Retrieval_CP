what i love about ace attorney is how natural the character development can be, because the games are played out over such a long in-game time period. in a normal story the character development happens because someone has an epiphany and is forced to change, but in ace attorney the development can happen because you‚Äôre just getting older! maya‚Äôs not a kid anymore! phoenix isn‚Äôt the optimistic, naive art student, miles softens over time because sometimes we do that as we grow older. they‚Äôre all adjusting to the real world from who they used to be and they‚Äôre growing!! babe that‚Äôs real, actual, growth, and growth doesn‚Äôt always happen through epiphanies, sometimes it happens through facing the hard truth and sometimes it happens from letting people love you.
