    Summary
      It's a world where your blood changes most everything. We are told that the lighter your blood the purer you are, the good. But as human nature foretells, we sin, and most live life with their blood forever muddied. The worst of the worse- the despicable, bleed the darkest black. This is the fact that L will use to his advantage, the winning factor that must prove that Light Yagami is indeed Kira. It has to. But things don't exactly go as planned, and fate has much in store for the pair than simply being rivals.
