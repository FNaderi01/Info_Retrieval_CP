    Summary
      Katsuki was never into conspiracy theories, but as he sat inside his designated holding cell, with charges of abusing his authority, aggressive behavior/assault charges towards civilians and co-workers, among three other charges. He had a suspicious feeling, something was going on behind the scenes.
