You just open it, video chat with up to five friends, and watch stuff together.Hey, neat. Anything else I should know?Nah, itâ€™s pretty simple. It looks like thatðŸ‘‡ . Weâ€™ve got some ideas about where to go with it, but hey, all in good time.Â &lt;3 TumblrOh, p.s., the Android version should be out in a few weeks. Enjoy.Â p.p.s., as promised, Cabana is now on Android. Have fun, Tumblr. #blog3 years agoFandometrics: The Week in Reviewthefandometrics:Some brand new babies, and those who have returned(Movies) To the surprise of approximately zero people, Wonder Woman earned the Â No. 1 spot. To the surprise of maybe a few more than zero people, Baywatch made it to No. 16. (Celebrities) Thanks to Wonder Woman, director Patty Jenkins makes her wonderful debut at No. 9 and Chris Pine (No. 2) returns to the list for the first time since August 2016. (Video Games) The Walking Dead (No. 16) is an old favorite on our Television list, but this is the first time the video game has ranked. (Television) Sense8 (No. 4) returns, only because itâ€™s leaving. The news of its cancellation was a bad way to kick off June. (Ships) Paperhat (Villainousâ€™ Black Hat and Dr. Flug) debuts at No. 12.Originally posted by diana-princeÂ Who knows CPR? These things need to be revived:(Music) Lana Del Rey (No. 17) fell eight spots while Katy Perry (No. 19) fell seven. Swish, swish. (Celebrities) It pains us to say it, but Misha Collins has stumbled eight spots to No. 15. What will it take to get him back up? Weâ€™ve already had so many Mishapocalypses. (Television) With all the hubbub about Wonder Woman, no one is paying attention to Supergirl (No. 13). She fell eight spots in one week. Thatâ€™s not nearly as bad as The 100, a show that fell a record fourteen spots in a mere seven days.(Ships) Bellarke (The 100â€™s Bellamy Blake and Clarke Griffin) fell eight spots, but lands at a still impressive No. 11. The same canâ€™t be said for Evak (Skamâ€™s Even Bech NÃ¦sheim and Isak Valtersen), who is barely there at No. 20.Originally posted by nevener#blog(Source: fandom, via staff)3 years agothefandometrics:You did it.
