The Good Place. AgainOct. 10th, 2020 10:02 pm
I spent the last week-ish binge watching the entirety of the good place. (second run through of the series). I'm not quite sure how I managed it but I did.Now it's over again and I'm actually quite melancholy. It's such a wild ride.

Now what?Sep. 2nd, 2020 02:57 pm
Well bbtp_challenge ran yesterday and has a lovely big masterlist hereAnd now there's a sudden lack of things I'm interested in doing.For the first time since,  oh 2011 I think? When I wrote one of my all time favourite fics. That I won't be taking part in Smutty Claus, because it finished last year.I can't say I was the best at reading what was posting there, or that I regularly got my entry in on time. But it was still probably the fest that got my longest highest quality work done for it. And I think I'm really going to miss it.

BootsAug. 9th, 2020 05:16 pm
 It'a bit cooler today and I'm feeling a lot better. Started out feeling a bit rough but the walk and lunch did me good  i think.I wore new walking boots today. They are a couple of sizes bigger than the last pair and slightly loose but i laced them tight and they didn't rub on my ankles on the way I feared. The left one did rub on the side of my big toe a little so one of us is going to wear out there soon or later.Mostly posting this for myself, when they inevitably fall apart, I can figure out how long they've lasted.I buy cheap boots and it always reminds me of The Samuel Vimes Boots Theory of Socio-Economic Unfairness

This is the cleaned up version, I've fixed the typos as much as possible and removed any authorial notes, (it's more edited than my usual fic!) but otherwise I've left it as unaltered as possible. It is a little tongue in cheek and has a throw everything against the wall approach. So most of those tags only occur quite briefly.If you'd like to read the original drunk creation it is located on the comm:here As usual  sdk created fantastic banners for all participants:( Banner )-( Wild Oats And The Spreading Thereof )

As you all jolly well know by now: harrypotter_birthdayparty  is open for business and we've already had some great entries. And there's plenty of time still to get something (more ;) ) in!It is... boiling hot here and I'm trying to round out my smut for it.Have a great day and great weekend all!ps. weasleyjumpers and hp_nextgen_fest  are also prompting as well but are less important. Also firewhiskeyfic 's entries are up for reading and viewing.But mostly it's Harry at the moment!

Sunshine Challenge: BlueJul. 17th, 2020 09:36 am
So these challenges haven't clicked with me so far but this one did:If you’d like a more specific idea to kick things off: share with us some songs or albums that remind you of the color blue or its theme.And it reminds me the time of Batman showed off his singing voice in Justice League Unlimited which was done by his regular voice actor Kevin Conroy:( I AM... BATMAN! (embedded videos under the cut) )That's all from me. Real blast from the past for me though! :)
