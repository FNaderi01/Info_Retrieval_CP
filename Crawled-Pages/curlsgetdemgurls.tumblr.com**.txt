     | source | vialiteratigifs -->Brick by Brick- I’ve had a lot of feelings and emotions this past week, and I didn’t know how to get them out. I haven’t written in quite some time, but it’s always been an outlet for me, so I’ve written this little piece to express those feelings I don’t know what to do with. I don’t even care if no one reads this, I needed to write it. Enjoy if you do xx. —————–She loved him. She hadn’t spoken to him in six years. But she loved him.

Walking the Tightrope - Jamie and Claire AUThe year is 1919, and a 13 year old Claire Beauchamp has just lost both her parents to the Spanish Influenza. Alone in the world, and out of options, Claire runs away, stumbling across train tracks. When she wipes away her tears, she discovers a train, and is welcomed aboard.  What happens when Claire finds out that the train is home to the Ringling Brothers &amp; Barnum and Bailey Circus? Luckily, she meets a family – The Fraser’s, who help her learn the circus life. But, will she always want to stay? Or will she eventually grow up and realize it’s time to leave the circus and her best friend, Jamie… behind? This is the first 3(ish) and only chapters of this fic. I will also add the outline for what this story was going to be at the end. I hope you enjoy it and I was excited to get into the twists of this story. Moodboard by @beaauchamp xxChapter One Boston, Massachusetts 1919Claire Elizabeth Beauchamp was 13 years old when she ran away to the circus. Normally, young girls don’t run away to join circuses — especially not young British girls who had just moved to America.

Long time no see…HelloooooooooSo, I have 3 unfinished Outlander fics that I want to post here, would anyone be interested? When I say unfinished, I do mean that I won’t be continuing them, no matter if someone sent me cookies or a dog lol. They are 3 separate stories with one, two, or three chapters. I have the outline all done and I was really excited to write these fics, but alas, shit hit the fan and I will no longer be writing for the OL fandom. Let me know if anyone wants to read unfinished fics. I know it’s kind of a tease to only give you a little bit, but I feel it’s a waste for them to never be seen. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy! 26 Apr 20 4:11PM | 56 notes› unfinished fics

“It helped that we 
do have a very natural rapport with each other…. These two characters 
physically need to be very comfortable with one another. They’re 
literally intertwined for half the film.” Ronan says.Chalamet adds: “In the least 
clichéd way possible, it really doesn’t feel like [I’m] acting sometimes
 [with her].”

     | source | viachailame -->sirxusblack:                     My Dearest Allie. I couldn’t sleep last night because I know that it’s over between us. I’m not bitter anymore, because I know that what we had was real. And if in some distant place in the future we see each other in our new lives, I’ll smile at you with joy and remember how we spent the summer beneath the trees, learning from each other and growing in love. The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more, that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds, and that’s what you’ve given me. That’s what I hope to give to you forever. I love you. I’ll be seeing you.                                                                                                              ‒ Noah3 Feb 20 3:46PM | 1,058 notes
