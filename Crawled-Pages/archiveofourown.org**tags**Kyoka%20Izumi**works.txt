    Summary
      If it’s anything Ryūnosuke Akutagawa is more certain about, it's that he is a horrible human being. He had always been one, but he really showed his true colours with exploding at Atsushi, his perfect boyfriend of three years, about something so small and harmless. And of course, he destroyed himself as well as the only man he ever truly cared about.

    Summary
      Mom blinked at the question before narrowing her eyes. It took several moments for her to answer his question only instead of answering it Izuku was given a question back, “How high is the heel?” It was now Izuku’s turn to blink in bemusement. “...I don’t know,” Izuku admitted and shame was beginning to make his stomach a twisted, knotted mess of nervousness. He shouldn’t have wasted his mom’s time if he didn’t know that because that was a good question! He should have waited until tomorrow evening so that afternoon he could have asked Ochako. ...That was of course assuming she knew without having to measure a heel of her boots with a ruler. It was then that Izuku remembered how Ochako had admitted with a hand behind her head (a nervous tick) she should have written what she wanted for her costume because she ended up in a skin tight suit that she hadn’t liked.

    Summary
      A fanfic based on Episode 10 of Ulysses, Wandering Rocks, except in BSD. It takes you through small bits of the BSD character's lives, each leading to the other in some way. Each small bit is written in the same way and has a universal theme: the characters are always put in a situation which they don't want to be, and they each escape it, but they force themselves back into it for some reason or another. The way I wrote this was the current character spots the next characters or they think about the next characters. I also keep the characters unnamed until you get to them, which, usually it's easy to guess who it is.

    Summary
      “Insomma, la storia a cui stavo pensando” risponde Atsushi, parlandogli sopra. “È la Bella e la Bestia. Qualche settimana fa Kunikida-san mi ha prestato un libro in cui diceva che la storia era un po’ la ripresa popolare europea di una leggenda degli Antichi Romani. O un popolo così. Forse erano i Greci. In realtà non ricordo. Forse erano tutti e due. Ed era Amore e Psiche. E nella storia, Amore era -il figlio di Afrodite e Psiche era bellissima e tutti dicevano fosse più bella della dea della bellezza e quindi Afrodite manda suo figlio a ucciderla. Ma Amore invece decide di salvarle la vita e la nasconde in una grotta.”“Questa storia non fa ridere” gli fa notare Akutagawa.

    Summary
      Bakugo Katsuki is a top student at the premier hero academy in the world. Bakugo Katsuki is a boy with the ability to use his sweat as a weapon, each droplet containing enough nitroglycerin to obliterate a phone book. Bakugo Katsuki enjoys reading manga where boys fall in love with one another. Two out of the three are commonly accepted facts. The final one is a heavily guarded secret that Bakugo protects with his life. At least until his vigilance lapses, and he loses a doujinshi.
Will he be able to recover what he lost before anyone realizes it's his? Or, by the end of this, will he have found something he didn't know he was missing?

    Summary
      Историческое AU, Йокогама первой половины XX века.Не обделенный талантом Дазай Осаму по собственной воле занимается не самым благородным делом в области литературы - написанием рассказов и повестей для других людей, тем самым спасая самого себя от помешательства, вызванного своим же писательским даром. Покинув стены психиатрической лечебницы, где оказался после очередной попытки суицида, Дазай отчаянно цепляется за то, что, быть может, вытянет его из водоворота собственного безумия.Σχίσιμο (Схисимо) - от греч. - расщепление. От этого же слова ведет свое происхождение термин "шизофрения" - др.-греч. σχίζω «расщеплять, раскалывать» + др.-греч. φρήν «грудь, сердце, душа; ум, мышление».Чудесный арт от Mikele - https://twitter.com/m_i_k_e_l_e_1_5/status/1244685368995336192Еще один замечательный арт от Nicephores Retura - https://twitter.com/kitsu7marika/status/1252235217558896640

    Summary
      「片桐, 悠翔」Katagiri, Yuuto know to the public as 「翔」 Fumetsu. Life for Katagiri-san is fast-paced and tiring. Seeing as he has one of the rarest gifts recorded in history many people want to use him. Though... he is as evasive as he is laidback, Katagiri-san really doesn't care for fighting or running from people who want to use him - he certainly doesn't play nice though. When certain events land him in the middle of Yokohama, Japan, Katagiri-san is faced with several problems that he can't seem to get himself out of without giving away his secrets. Especially when a suicidal maniac displays the gift to neutralize other gifts.
