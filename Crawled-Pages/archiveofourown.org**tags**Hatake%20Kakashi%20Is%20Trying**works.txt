    Summary
      Just as she’s slipping on her sandals, her hair not even pulled up in its signature ponytail or buns yet, there’s a pounding on her door, and then Naruto is bursting through and collapsing on her couch. Her arms twitched as she stared at him for a second, before she shook her head at him. “Naruto-kun, you’re breaking and entering, y’know.” she drawled, finishing zipping and buckling her mid-calf sandals. or;Haztanukai Freyja is a disgraced clan heir who's transferred to Konoha, and nothing is every easy with Team Disaster.

    Summary
      Well it's my first time on this site. I'm a Weeb so I thought after seeing so many Naruto fanfictions do one myself. I'll just Summarize it. The Kyuubi basically gives Naruto a talk on the many he's lacking that a Ninja needs (He's 8) and Naruto takes his advice and begins to work way harder then in canon and varies his jutsu aswell.The first chapter will pretty much be telling you everything going on in the story (it may be short).

    Summary
      When Tsunade informs Kakashi of her decision to draft Naruto into ANBU, he recalls that ANBU cope and process their work in...unusual ways. He offers his unwavering support to his former student and the Savior of the World, a promise to be there for Naruto no matter what the need.Needless to say, he is profoundly under-prepared for those needs.

    Summary
      Uchiha Itachi does more damage to Sasuke's mind with his newly acquired mangekyou sharingan than intended when someone interferes with his attempt to manipulate his young brother. 
Sasuke's mind is not what it once was. He is not whoever he was before the massacre, because he has no memory of a time Before it. 
This is Sasuke without Avenging, this is how things could have been.

      All of team seven are growing well with their sensei's lessons (even when he's not the best at explaining the basics) and Sakura perhaps particularly, even enjoying it as she grows as a ninja! Sasuke . . . is not taking her improvement well. Kakashi-sensei has to step in, in more than one way.

Things are looking up until Sasuke's criminal record is quietly expunged, attracting a barrage of lawsuits and child support claims from the 16 children he fathered during his post-war bachelor adventures. A colorful entourage of embittered Uchiha youth make their debut in Konoha, and leading the civil charge is yet another ghost from the past: a young lawyer from Ryūtan City, who happens to be the only son of the infamous Clan Killer, Itachi Uchiha.AKAThe one where Sasuke revives the clan, and the clan revives Sasuke. After they sue him, of course.

      You were single. Correction, you were happily single. You absolutely, did not, by any means, need a relationship.However, the universe seemed to have other plans for you when you literally fell into Kakashi Hatake's life. Well, the universe and both of your meddling friends. If all turned out well, maybe you’d consider thanking them someday (but that really didn’t seem likely).

      Obito was dying. Dying after trying to save the only people who could stop what he'd done.Key word: Trying.He'd failed, and died knowing that the end of the world was his fault and there was no way to fix it.That's when he'd woken up with an all encompassing but familiar ache in a long forgotten cave, with the statue of the ten-tails looming over him.
