    Summary
      What if the three White Knights, guarding the Tower of Joy knew of Ned Stark's search for his sister.  What if they were able to meet him in secret and concoct a plan to keep the new-born King safe until he could reclaim his rightful throne.Jon (Aegon Targaryen) grows up, helped by a small group that secretly prepares Westeros for the restoration of the Targaryen dynasty. As he comes of age, Jon gradually takes charge of his own destiny.This is a Jon-centric story where he claims his birthright and has dragons.  Daenerys' life is vastly different compared to canon.  She will meet Jon without having conquered Essos and has a long way to go before becoming a dragonrider in her own right.  Endgame, however, will be a happy Jonerys riding dragons together and ruling as equals.

    Summary
      That day at Castle Black begins as every day does. The sun remains hidden behind imposing clouds and the air is bitingly cold even with the arrival of spring. Sluggish recruits train in the yard as their practice swords clang against one another. Above them, the ancient wooden lift groans and creaks as it ascends and descends the towering Wall. It is business as usual for the men of the Night’s Watch, dismal as that business is.Then they see the Stark banners coming their way. Proud direwolves snapping in the breeze like fishes’ tails as they swim upstream against the raging currents. One hundred men in exchange for Jon Snow.

    Summary
      It’s been one year since the death of Daenerys Targaryen, called by some "the mad queen", and the North and the Six Kingdoms try to rebuild all that was lost. Jon Snow had disappeared beyond the Wall, his wolf last seen near Hardhome. Queen Sansa "the Wise" is facing unrest in the nearby villages, which leads her to make questionable choices in the eyes of her people. In the South, king Bran the Broken fell seemingly ill and fear for his life makes people uneasy about the succession. As once again instability risks to break the kingdoms, a hero reappears, with the name of a long-feared enemy, and an old song is beginning to be sung once again, with fire and ice meeting for one last dance.
