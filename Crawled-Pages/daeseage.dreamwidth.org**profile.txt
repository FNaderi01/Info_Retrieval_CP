                  Name:daeseageBirthdate:Mar 8  
                 Mini Bio
                I'm a recent graduate with a BS in Biology (the best science, hands down!), currently looking for work and enjoying my long vacation.  I am a fan of science in general, and plants, fungi, and genetics in particular.  I hope to continue my education, either in grad school or working towards teaching secondary school science.  I also knit, am planning to move in with my beautiful girlfriend this Spring, adore audiobooks and podfic, drink copious amounts of tea, and watch more Netflix than is probably good for me.  If this is important to you, I am also not-religious (agnostic, I guess).This journal is predominantly personal, although I do publish a podfic or fanfic as the fancy strikes me.  I'm not that great at regular posts, but I aim for at least a couple updates a month -- personal or fandom-related. =]If you ever have anything that you'd like to say to me, please say it!  I don't bite, and I do like people, contrary to the indications of my rather vacant real-life social calendar! Speaking of which, if you happen to be in Northern Nevada, my New Year's Resolution is to make some new friends.
