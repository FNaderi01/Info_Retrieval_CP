    Summary
      “Come on,” Magnus stretched out a hand for Alec to grab. Alec took it, holding it tight, and stood up. “Are you going to go back home to grab your clothes?”“I was thinking…” Magnus said,  “...that I could borrow some of your clothes.”Alec shook his head and smiled. “Just so you can never return them again?”“Hey, I gave you your hoodie back last week, didn’t I?” Magnus pouted, then started to walk towards the house, without letting go of Alec’s hand. It was moments like these that made his brain flooded with thoughts, the way Magnus didn’t let go of Alec’s hand and how their enclasped palms swung between them as they walked. It might seem like a small gesture. They have walked hand-in-hand before, and Magnus probably didn’t even think anything of it. But it still never failed to make Alec question: Would Magnus ever want this as more than friends? Or: Alec would be lying if he said that winter wasn't his favorite part of the year. More specifically, Magnus cuddled up to his side as snow falls behind the window. Just him and his best friend, who he's totally not in love with.[Flufftober day 9, Snowy Day]

    Summary
      Still blindly following Clave orders, Alec infuriates Magnus and gets kicked out of the loft.  Magnus nurses his emotional wounds and Dot shows up. Lots of vodka, emotional upheaval, and recently compromised state with Azazael lead the doorway open for an unwelcome visit from one of Magnus's many uncles, A Prince of Hell, Greater Demon Samael -- with a personal agenda against Magnus and everything he holds dear.  Alec unwittingly gets caught in the middle. This doesn't bode well for either of them in the (tumultous) aftermath.Canon divergent season 2 episode 13CHAPTER 20 UPDATED

    Summary
      Magnus turned in the cage of Alec’s arms to face him and placed his hands on Alec’s shoulders. ‘That wasn’t so hard now, was it?” he grinned and leaned in until their lips were brushing against each other, “Dancing…”Alec pulled away for a bit, frowning in confusion. “What?”“That…” Magnus said, nodding between the two of them, “was a perfect spin.”“It was all you,” Alec disregarded, rolling his eyes.Magnus shook his head. “You’re a natural dancer,” he gave Alec a eskimo kiss, rubbing his nose against Alec’s. “You just need to silence the negative thoughts in that pretty head of yours and go with the flow.”Alec huffed. “Sure, Magnus”“Believe in yourself a little, Alexander.” Magnus said, before he ducked in from under Alec's arms and stood beside him, stretching his arm, palm up, “Come on,” he wiggled his fingers, “Our wedding’s in three days, let’s practice.” or: Alec has never been big on dancing, so naturally, he's a bit nervous about his wedding dance. And Magnus, also his fiance, is more than happy to help him practice.[Flufftober day 7, Dancing]

    Summary
      Magnus always said that the past didn't matter, and for a long time Alec felt the same. However, Camille told him about Magnus life, many aspects of which he had not known. Despite all assurances that the past didn't matter, Alec wanted to know. When Alec asked Magnus about his past Magnus often tried to avoid an answer or change the subject. Camille instead answered him without hesitation. He loved Magnus. He really did. But he had not realised that soon, it had become a habit to just talk to Camille about Magnus rather than Magnus himself. He’d even stopped visiting Magnus unknowingly, keeping his visits to Camille like a dirty secret. However, all these secrets began to distance them from each other.

    Summary
      Nie zdawał sobie sprawy z tego, co robił. Magnus zawsze mówił, że przeszłość nie ma znaczenia i przez dłuższy czas Alec uważał tak samo. Jednak Camille zaczęła mu opowiadać o życiu Magnusa, którego on nie znał. Mimo wszystkich zapewnień, że przeszłość nie ma znaczenia, Alec chciał wiedzieć. Wciąż łapał się na tym, że gdy nasuwało mu się jakieś pytanie, które chciałby zadać czarownikowi, przychodził do Camille, ponieważ ona zawsze mu odpowiadała, natomiast Magnus zbywał go lub zmieniał temat. Kochał go. Jednak wszystkie te tajemnice zaczęły ich od siebie oddalać.

    Summary
      “I know what you’re doing. It’s not gonna happen, Magnus.” Alec whispered next to his ear and Magnus shivered involuntarily. Damn it, he was supposed to be the one doing the seducing.“I have no idea what you’re talking about, darling.” Magnus tried to say innocently, his lips still attached to Alec’s pale skin, just above a rune.Alec shook his head. “You’ll see the costume tomorrow.” was all he said.“But, Alexander,” Magnus practically whined, giving up on his actions and pouting at his boyfriend.Alec laughed again and the sound was brilliant and pure. He put a finger under Magnus’ chin, lifting his gaze to meet Alec’s. The shadowhunter smiled at him before he leaned down.“You can wait for me, can’t you?” he asked against the warlock's lips and Magnus felt himself finally give in.“Do I have a choice?”//Or, Magnus is dying to know what Alec's Halloween costume is, and Alec is surprisingly good at keeping it a secret.[Day 5 of Flufftober 2020, Celebration]

    Summary
      Going on a solo mission has its dangers. Alec knew that. Every Shadowhunter KNEW that. So much so that none ever did it and the few that did never returned alive. In training their instructors, or Hodge, would always say to go with your gut when you weren’t sure. It would not lead you astray. Again, he KNEW that, but he didn’t listen. Now as he found himself in the precarious situation he was in, all he could hear was, you Should’ve Gone with Your Gut.

    Summary
  “You hear that, Alexander? Our house guest is being a smartass already. I think he would have been just fine if you had left him in the street yesterday.”
  Alec just smiles a bit, which is not the impassioned defense Jace would have liked to see him give. “Sure,” Alec says. “Jace, do you want some eggs?”

    Summary
      magnus was usually fond of alec's friends. usually, because he wasn't very fond of jace herondale when he was breaking into magnus's bedroom and dragging him from sleep at two in the god-damned morning.this, magnus thinks, as he watches jace try to intimidate his cup of coffee into cooling down, had better be good.(or: jace shows up at magnus and alec's apartment with questions and some very exciting news)

    Summary
      Magnus is struck suddenly by the memory of another Shadowhunter he knew who was willing to give up everything for the love of a mundane girl. ‘I was born to be a warrior, and I was born to be with her. Tell me how to reconcile the two because I cannot.’ The words of one Edmund Herondale rang clear in Magnus’ mind, bringing a slow, sad smile to his face. “You Herondales certainly have a penchant for sacrificial love,” Magnus observes, not unkindly. Edmund gave up his runes, James his sanity and stability, Will was ready to give up love itself, and now Jace...---Or, how far will Jace go to have Clary in his life again?
