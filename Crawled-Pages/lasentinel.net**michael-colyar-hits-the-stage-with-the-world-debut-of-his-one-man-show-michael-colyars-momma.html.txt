The wait for Michael Colyar’s highly anticipated one man show, “Michael Colyar’s Momma” is finally over. The debut of the dramatic one man show will premiere, Friday, February 3 and Saturday, February 4 at the Hollywood Barnsdall Theatre.
“I am looking forward to actually doing this show, this is the biggest challenge of my life, especially the biggest challenge of my creative career,” said Colyar. “I am going to be standing on stage in a room full of people whose work I have seen an admired and now, they are coming to see me.”
The show will walk play goers through Colyar’s early childhood in the Chicago projects, his Hollywood fame, struggle with addictions and the impact of his mother’s legacy.

“She raised five men, she insisted that we were going to be raised to be great responsible men when we grew up,” said Colyar.
“She just gave us such life and a positive outlook on life that it made it easy for us to continue. I think that’s what parents are supposed to do, they are supposed to set you up so if they up and die, you can pick up and continue to live without their guidance, and that’s what my mom and dad did.
“I had an awesome father, but my mother is the real source that inspires me today. It is her love, kindness, understanding, and encouragement. She believed in me when I was really young thinking I wanted to act, thinking I wanted to do comedy. She reminded me, I don’t have to think about it, all I have to do is go do it.”
While working on the one man show, Colyar worked with director Iona Morris.
“She [Morris] helped me find stuff out about by life, I didn’t even remember or realize. Now, I am just blown away by this whole experience, everything about it is exciting,” said Colyar.
“We took what I had basically written and Iona pried into that and found deeper things that I needed to know. It’s called, ‘Michael Colyar’s Momma,’ but I know now more about my mother and my family than I did when I sat down with Morris and start putting it together.”
“Michael Colyar’s Momma” will tour in 100 cities, including New York, Cleveland, Detroit, Cincinnati, Baltimore, Atlanta, and New Orleans.
“This is not just something that is going to be hysterical, this is going to be historical,” said Colyar. “It is not just comedy, it is drama. Anyone who makes it to this show is going to be able to tell everyone how great it is and then, we ring that bell around the country.”

Recently, Colyar brought his funny to the release of his new book, “Miss Innocent Goes to Kool Skool and Other Silly Stuff.” The adult poetry book which colorfully illustrates his personal story, discusses his struggles, triumphs and his dedication to his family all while healing people through laughter.
Topics include drug addiction, parenting, love, obesity, racism and God.
Colyar is passionate about helping his community, once a month, he takes comics into a local prison as part of his “Comics Go to Jail,” program and perform free comedy for the inmates to remind them although their bodies are in prison, their minds are free.
With the recent election of President Donald Trump, Colyar reminds the Black community to stay positive, love one another and to put the guns down. He is spreading this message in his latest project, the “Soundtrack of My Life.” The money from the film, will go toward building music studios in Chicago for inner city kids. Artist such as Twista, Da Brat, Dave Hollister and more are teaming up with Colyar for the film.
“Cause in Chicago, the soundtrack is gunshots, helicopters and sirens,” said Colyar. “The film, will remind Black people of their greatness.
“We say put the guns down so we can show you a better alternative. Maybe we can turn these young gang bangers into young Jay-Z’s.”
