									Mónica García: New ‘Everyone Counts’ resolution will break down data for L.A.’s diverse Asian student body &amp; battle the model-minority myth
										I know what it is like for a whole community to feel invisible. Before I began my service on the L.A. Unified School District Board of Education in 2006 as just the third Latina elected in 155 years, questions about whether Latino/a students could succeed academically were answered only by assumptions due to our lack...
