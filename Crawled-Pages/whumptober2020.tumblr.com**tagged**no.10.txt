It features my character Vaarur, a Vulcan from the Star Trek universe. This doesn‚Äôt mention anything too specific from said universe. There will be a read more after the second paragraph. I hope you enjoy and feel free to reblog if you do!- - - - -It is very difficult to make one of his kind dizzy through any means, especially Vaarur himself who is nearly the most physically fit as they come. But a few knife wounds would do it. Especially since they come from a knife made by such a brutal species. He can hear the assailants running down the corridor behind him as they try to open a door he managed to lock closed and give himself time. He can‚Äôt accurately calculate the amount of time it will give him since there‚Äôs too many variables to account for.  Keep reading
