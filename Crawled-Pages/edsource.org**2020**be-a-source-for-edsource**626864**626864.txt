How is remote learning working out?
We need your insights! In a state as vast and diverse as California, we depend on parents, educators, students, administrators,  policymakers and community members like you to help us understand what's working at your schools, colleges and early child care centers — and what must be improved.
Please join our community network and help inform our coverage of California education.

Who should participate?
The network is open to anyone who cares about or has a stake in California’s public education system. Parents, teachers and other school staff, early child care providers, school administrators and board members, college faculty and administrators, students, advocates, researchers and community members are all invited to join.
By participating, you will have a direct channel to reach out to us with your ideas, questions and concerns and our reporters will be able to contact you for perspective and insights on how the issues they are covering is affecting you or playing out in your community.
