    Summary
      Last night, they went to bed in their dorms.
This morning, they woke up in either A) an abandoned building, B) unfamiliar apartments with unfamiliar school uniforms, C) a plush bedroom nicer than their entire house... or D) the League of Villains' headquarters, because of COURSE Izuku still manages to draw the shortest straw even when others are screwed over too.
UA tries its best to prepare its students for anything, but one topic it never covered: what to do if you wake up in an alternate dimension. Six students suddenly find themselves in an unfamiliar world where the balance between Heroes and Villains is more unstable than ever and they have no idea how they got there or to get home. All they know is that this world is horribly wrong, and they're largely on their own. (Well, except Izuku, but he thinks he'd prefer that.)

    Summary
      If there is one thing that Shouto Todoroki knows, it is that everyone has their secrets. From the greatest hero to the lowest villain, to all that remains between that gap, each person has something they hide from the world.And Izuku Midoriya is no different.-----In which Todoroki believes his conspiracy a little too much, and ends up wanting to protect his friend.

      They say All Might was a natural with One For All. He could smash the crap out of anything he needed to or wanted to. What if Izuku was also a natural? Short snippets from canon, where Izuku goes beyond.
