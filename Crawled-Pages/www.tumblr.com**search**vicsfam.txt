“When did you know you loved me?”Crowley’s sleepy smile blooms like the flowers in his garden, currently bathing in the humid summer rain. He tucks his chin more securely into the curve of Aziraphale’s neck, and watches his soft chest move up and down.“I knew on the garden wall,” murmurs Crowley. “When you sounded so wrecked and insecure about giving away your sword. But you did it anyway. You followed your heart over Heaven, you always have. And in so doing, you stole mine.”Aziraphale hums, and wiggles under Crowley’s arm in pleasure. But this is an answer he’s heard before, and now it’s his turn.“When did you know you loved me?” Crowley dutifully asks.“I knew in the destroyed church,” says Aziraphale. Crowley’s grown his hair out since they moved into the cottage, and Aziraphale plays with it now, drapes it across his belly like rivers of wine. “When you burned yourself and brought down the very walls to keep me safe. When you knew what I wanted even before I did. You acted like it was the simplest thing in the world - protecting, saving, loving me. And in so doing, you made the choice simple for me as well.”They play this game sometimes, during pockets of time that are slow and lazy, honey-tipped minutes and hard-earned peace. They helped save the world, after all - it owes them this time, when the sharp things are put away and they can speak as indulgently as they please.“When did you know you loved me?” whispers Aziraphale.“I knew in Rome, when your enthusiasm to share your joys overrode protocol. When did you know you loved me?”“On the sea, when I found you in the belly of Noah’s ark with the children.” Aziraphale brushes his toes over the scales patterned around Crowley’s ankles. “And you?”“The look on your face when you saw Hamlet for the first time in a packed theater.”“I knew when I saw you hold Warlock for the first time,” says Aziraphale. “The wonder on your face lifted me higher than my wings ever could.”“I knew when I realized you only give away books to people who need them most,” Crowley tells him. He presses his lips just below Aziraphale’s ear. “The ones that wander into your shop lost and desperate, beaten and exhausted. You miracle books into existence for them to find on the shelves. Tell them it’s on the house, doesn’t go with your collection anyway.”“I knew when you hopped over to Japan in 1945 and didn’t come back for a decade.” Aziraphale begins to thread his fingers through the tangles in Crowley’s hair, unsnarling them one by one; Crowley’s golden eyes droop with bliss.“I knew in the eighties, when you spent hours in hospital rooms that the nurses wouldn’t enter,” he says.“I knew when I saw you step out of your inferno of a car.”“I knew when I ran into you at your first drag show in 1963.” Crowley smirked. “And I knew when you told me it wasn’t your first. With a blessed wink.”Aziraphale chuckles, and makes his final move. “I know I love you every time I hear your laugh. Every time you fall asleep in my arms.”Crowley closes his eyes. He is warm with blankets and body heat and love. He’d Fall - hell, he’d fucking cannonball - from Heaven all over again if he knew it’d lead him to this.“I know I love you,” Crowley says. He doesn’t need to give a reason.He never did.
