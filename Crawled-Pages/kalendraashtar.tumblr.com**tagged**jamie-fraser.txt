“Do ye ever think-” he began, and then broke off. “Think what?” I bent and kissed his chest, arching my back to encourage him to rub it, which he did. “Well … I’m no so sure I can explain, but it’s struck me that now I have lived longer than my father did-which is not something I expected to happen,” he added, with faint wryness. “It’s only … well, it seems odd, is all. I only wondered, did ye ever think of that, yourself-having lost your mother young, I mean?“ “Yes.” My face was buried in his chest, my voice muffled in the folds of his shirt. “I used to-when I was younger. Like going on a journey without a map." His hand on my back paused for a moment. "Aye, that’s it.” He sounded a little surprised. “I kent more or less what it would be like to be a man of thirty, or of forty-but now what?” His chest moved briefly, with a small noise that might have been a mixture of amusement and puzzlement. “You invent yourself,” I said softly, to the shadows inside the hair that had fallen over my face. “You look at other women-or men; you try on their lives for size. You take what you can use, and you look inside yourself for what you can’t find elsewhere. And always … always … you wonder if you’re doing it right.”His hand was warm and heavy on my back. He felt the tears that ran unexpectedly from the corners of my eyes to dampen his shirt, and his other hand came up to touch my head and smooth my hair. “Aye, that’s it,” he said again, very softly. The camp was beginning to stir outside, with clangings and thumps, and the hoarse sound of sleep-rough voices. Overhead, the grasshopper began to chirp, the sound like someone scratching a nail on a copper pot. “This is a morning my father never saw,” Jamie said, still so softly that I heard it as much through the walls of his chest, as with my ears. “The world and each day in it is a gift, mo chridhe-no matter what tomorrow may be." I sighed deeply and turned my head, to rest my cheek against his chest. He reached over gently and wiped my nose with a fold of his shirt. "And as for taking stock,” he added practically, “I’ve all my teeth, none of my parts are missing, and my cock still stands up by itself in the morning. It could be worse.”

                            "It was as if there was a - it wasna a door, exactly, but a passageway of some kind - before me. And I could go through it, if I wanted. And I did want to,” he said, giving me a sideways glance and a shy smile.
He had known what lay behind him, too, and realized that for that moment, he could choose. Go forward - or turn back.
“And that’s when you asked me to touch you?”
“I knew ye were the only thing that could bring me back,” he said simply. “I didna have the strength, myself."

                            "It’s…difficult to explain. It’s…it’s like…I think it’s as though everyone has a small place inside themselves, maybe, a private bit that they keep to themselves. It’s like a little fortress, where the most private part of you lives—maybe it’s your soul, maybe just that bit that makes you yourself and not anyone else.” His tongue probed his swollen lip unconsciously as he thought.“You don’t show that bit of yourself to anyone, usually, unless sometimes to someone that ye love greatly.” The hand relaxed, curling around my knee. Jamie’s eyes were closed again, lids sealed against the light.“Now, it’s like…like my own fortress has been blown up with gunpowder. There’s nothing left of it but ashes and a smoking rooftree, and the little naked thing that lived there once is out in the open, squeaking and whimpering in fear, tryin’ to hide itself under a blade of grass or a bit o’ leaf, but…but not…makin’ m-much of a job of it."

                            Anonymous asked: Very unfortunate that the boy couldn't act. Kudos to Sam, really. It must've been really difficult for him to make the scenes honest and touching when his acting partner couldn't reciprocate. He seripusly doesn't take enough credit for his work. I'll be bitter foreverI actually really liked the boy they used in Helwater, so too bad they couldn’t fertilize him into fast growth. I don’t have a problem with physical resemblance or the lack of it, as long as everything else works - here, I felt Sam saved every scene with William. I’m also sympathetic to the fact that it must be really hard on a young actor to be in so many scenes where you have to do physical stuff, say lines, act with your face, speak in an unfamiliar way AND act lord-like. It will probably get easier as he grows, because an older actor can come along.

                            Anonymous asked: Another relationship people don't talk enough about. Ian and Jamie. I absolutely love them together. Sam and John are killing it in their scenes, such a lovely comboAgreed, sweets! They work really well together, great timing in their dialogue. It also fills my heart with chocolate-like feelings, to know that Jamie has a hand on the upbringing/supporting of someone he so deeply loves, after all the children he didn’t get to raise. Also, how incredible it is to have another Ian, guarding Jamie’s right side? ❤
