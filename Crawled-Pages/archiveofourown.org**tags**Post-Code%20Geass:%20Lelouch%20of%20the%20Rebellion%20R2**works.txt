    Summary
      After everything that had happened, the world was at peace. Everyone was happy in the wake of the Demon Emperor's death, with two exceptions. A knight who was never meant to survive, and a prince who didn't, but is clinging on anyway. In a world where everyone hates you, one person can make all the difference.

    Summary
      * As of 5/2/20, Arc 1 is complete! Caught in shambles, Suzaku struggles to carry on with Lelouch's vision, and hits a breaking point on the anniversary of his death. With nothing to turn to and no one to confide in, he agrees to the first sliver of hope he finds — a plan presented to him by C.C., who mysteriously visits him the same night without warning.

    Summary
      It seemed there was still an Immortal after Lelouch's Geass purge. The woman may just be the one threat that reveals everything, destroying the peace Lelouch gave his mortality for and the friend for whom he was willing to risk everything else. Chapters 1-16 originally posted on ffnet from 08/21/2011 to 05/17/15. Returned to due to very kind reviews over the years. Updated as posted.

    Summary
      Lelouch vi Britannia had done it: the world was ruled by the tyranny of the Demon Emperor. Lelouch was only a few days away from atonement, world peace, and death, but those plans are violently shaken when Hiroto Minaka from MBI comes calling with an offer from destiny in the form a little bird called Sekirei.

      A new world is alive and well, and the actions of a dead man are no longer required. Alas, he's forced into action anyway when he's accidentally stumbled upon in his eternal hiding. Then he must suffer the fray in a world he wasn't meant to continue living in, now damned to do so forever. Post R2.

    Summary
  “I asked you a question.” His eyes were colder than the room. The deepest green of a cursed lake in the forest. Slick snakeskin. Leaves instantly killed by the frost. Orange flames of the candles didn’t even reach them.“No, sir.” Lelouch made an effort not to stutter from his teeth chattering. “My apologies, sir.”"Come closer.” Suzaku narrowed his eyes and pulled the end of the rope, wrapped around his wrist and fingers loosely.

    Summary
      Kallen Kozuki hates Suzaku Kururugi with all her might. He is the reason for her misery, for Lelouch's death, for all his failures. If Suzaku Kururugi had not existed, Lelouch would still be alive.
"If only Suzaku Kururugi had never been born." That is her wish, and it is heard. But when she wakes up in a world where Suzaku never existed, what will she find?
