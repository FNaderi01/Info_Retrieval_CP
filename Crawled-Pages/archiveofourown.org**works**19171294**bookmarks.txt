    Bookmark Notes:
      Andrew stroked his thumb along the jut of Neil’s hip as he spoke in a monotone. “I want to make a deal.”Neil tensed like he was about to fling himself from the roof. Andrew held tighter on instinct as well as- perhaps maybe- an act of comfort. The reaction told Andrew that he was aware enough to guess where this was going. He probably knew exactly what Andrew was going to ask for. He asked anyway.“Go to therapy. I will even help you find one you are comfortable with.”“You say that like it’s something I can be comfortable with,” Neil said into his shoulder. He didn’t move to pull away but his posture was stiff and impersonal. It was like his eyes were closed all over again, only this time he could mask his avoidance as affection. Andrew let him, maybe he would listen if this position made him more agreeable.
