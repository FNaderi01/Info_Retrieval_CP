Renewable Fuels
Becht provides highly technical support to clients in the renewable industry including biorefining, biofuels, biomass, solar and wind. We provided owner’s oversight on next-generation wind turbine technology in Europe and are actively consulting on next-generation nuclear technology in the US. Becht has provided insights to our clients seeking to add bio-based feedstocks into existing traditional crude refining technologies. We have provided strategic scale-up consulting and owner’s oversight to novel technology development.
Becht has provided assessments of potential new processes and designed equipment for new processes. For example we have worked on pilot plant facilities for a fluid solids biomass project and evaluated several green technologies for converting wastes into energy. We have also provided readiness reviews for processes such as direct coal liquefaction.  The combination of our process and equipment expertise enables us to provide comprehensive review and solutions.
