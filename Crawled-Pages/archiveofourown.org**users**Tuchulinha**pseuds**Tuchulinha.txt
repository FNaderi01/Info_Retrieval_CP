    Summary
      Derek gingerly limped over to him to check in on him when they were done, when the kelpie was finally dead, and the first thing he did was take Stilesâ€™ hand to pull his pain."What the fuck, no," Stiles said and nearly pushed Derek away. "Heal yourself first, dude, you can barely walk.""Donâ€™t call me dude," Derek grumbled as he limped over to a log to sit. "Weâ€™re fucking engaged."Stilesâ€™ stomach fluttered and he grinned, because yeah. They were engaged. He was going to marry Derek in a few months. Derek rolled his eyes when he saw his grin, but Stiles saw the smile tugging on his lips.Written for the prompt For the Sterek prompt generator...5 for all categories ðŸ¥°, which translates to "holding hands, on a couch, as a distraction".

    Summary
      When Stiles goes missing, Scott enlists the help of the Hale pack. Derek, who is just trying to be a better alpha, can't help but feel a pull towards the hyperactive teen, and the wolf in him won't rest until Stiles is found.  Meanwhile, old and new threats appear in Beacon Hills to stir things up. Somewhere along the way, Derek and Stiles finally get their shit together. Featuring a competent Hale pack, a not entirely evil Peter, a  slightly less self centered Scott, an exasperated Sheriff, slow burn Sterek, and Stiles being unique in more ways than one.

    Summary
      Derek has heard stories about the Spark -ghe kind of stories that would have his younger self cowering under the blankets. The kind of stories that had Derek stick close to the pack.But when Derek is in trouble, and the pack isnt around, Derek finds himself in the care of said Spark, and he finds out fairly quickly that he's not all he seems to be.Stiles, he finds out, isn't a villain at all. Derek's only heard one side of the story for four years, and now it's time for him to hear the other side from his mate.*-*"Pretty little wolf," he hummed, stepping closer and kneeling beside Derek. Even in his death fogged brain, he recognized the words spoken. The words that were tattooed along his hip bone.The man reached a hand out, long bony fingers brushing against Derek's jaw. That's when recognition dawned on him. He knew this boy -not personally, but he'd seen pictures. This was the Spark. The one Scott had warned him about since Derek had returned to Beacon Hills four years ago. His mate."Fuck me," Derek gasped out, dropping his head on the step."Let's get you better, first, shall we, Puppy?" The Spark hummed.
