    Summary
      Bucky has been in love with Steve Rogers forever.  James loved Natasha so much he let her go. The Soldier had his Sniper, the man he couldn't remember who meant everything to him.  This is their story and the complicated dance they do to discover just what it means to love more than one person.  An experimental piece in form and P.O.V. that looks at polyamory through the eyes of Bucky/James/The Soldier and his relationship/s with Steve, Natasha, and Clint.
