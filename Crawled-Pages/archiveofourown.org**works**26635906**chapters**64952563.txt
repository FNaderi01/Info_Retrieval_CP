      Is he having a seizure?
      JenCohen
          Summary:
              Set on episode 6 of season 2, in the family meeting. Klaus gets possessed by Ben but it turns out a little bit more dramatic than that. Nobody cared when he fell to the floor after what seemed a desperate attempt to gain attention, but they didn't expect for him to start seizing uncontrollably before their paralized gazes.I know, I suck at summaries. :D Hope you like it.

      Chapter 1: Is he having a seizure?
    Chapter Text
    Chapter 1- Is he having a seizure? Family meetingSuddenly, he felt his drink spilling all over his arms, his chest, even his face. Somehow his grip on the glass didn't loosen, he held to the glass like it was dear life. He couldn't control the shivering, his eyes wide in panic as he frantically searched for some comfort around the room. It didn't hurt, it just felt off somehow, like his body wasn't his anymore. His arms moved, shivered and he was sweating through his favorite shirt. He was trying to fight the feeling but didn't know what was the cause. His eyes filled with tears and fell in his cheeks without any warning, he couldn't wipe them off. His arms seemed to be stuck upwards. He couldn't find any comfort in his siblings, they just acted as if this was a normal reaction to alcohol or drugs, he even heard Diego say it was an overdose, but he knew it was something else. He wouldn't shake and stay conscious like that when he had OD'ed; Ben had told him several times that he had lost consciousness right away and he wouldn't wake up until he was in the back of an ambulance. Just as it began it ended; he blacked out, he didn't know how but he was already on the floor besides a sleeping or unconscious Ben. He didn't know which one. Somehow he felt worse, couldn't take the metallic taste off his mouth and something wet was and warm coming out of his nostrils, his head felt fuzzy and he couldn't see straight. He just saw five shadows hovering over him; of course, he thought, Reginald hadn't stayed for the show. - Why am I still shivering? I'm so cold, Why is Ben unconscious? Is he okay? Of course he is okay, he is a ghost- He couldn't think straight. All these thoughts rumbled in his mind and didn't stay for long. -Klaus?- A familiar voice was talking, no wait, screaming his name, - Diego? why does he sound so worried? -
-Is he okay?- someone else.
-I don't know, he doesn't look at me, it's like he can't see me-His chest tightened, he choked on the blood that was coming out of his nose and his mouth, he couldn't hear anything anyone said, it was like they were walking away. He started to feel a creeping fear climb his way to his chest. The feeling was very familiar, he had had panick attacks since he was a little boy and now, they came back, followed by what he didn't miss at all, the lack of air. - I..I can't...can't- A wheeze came out. Klaus' green eyes wide open in rising panic. His hands searching for somebody, anybody.
- What the hell?- Diego shouted and crouched down closer to his face. -Klaus? Listen to me, you can breathe, it's just a panick attack, just hold my hand, I'll show you-He did as he was told, trying to imitate his breathing, but suddenly a coughing fit started out of nowhere, he couldn't get any air. He felt his lungs had completely shut down. -I can't... it's not.... Di..Diego.. so.....something's wrong- he slurred every word, couldn't get two words together and the concern in the room just kept rising.  That last phrase was followed by a trickle of blood on his lips as he doubled over from the pain. He was coughing up blood. This was certainly more than a panic attack.
His eyes rolled back and he welcomed sweet darkness, his body started seizing again. -No, no!!! Hold on Klaus!- Diego just stood there, watching as his little brother trashed on the floor, with his hair damped on sweat and a nosebleed that didn't stop.
-Diego, turn him on his side, he's choking, he can't breathe!!-
-Oh my God, his lips are turning blue!-
