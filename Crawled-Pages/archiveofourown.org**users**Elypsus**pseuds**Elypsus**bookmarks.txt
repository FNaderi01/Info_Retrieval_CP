    No Archive Warnings ApplyRuby Rose (RWBY) Weiss Schnee Blake Belladonna Yang Xiao Long Penny PolendinaRomantic Comedy Matchmakers in a panic Who's going to end up together? Let's keep that a secret
    Summary
      It's obvious to Blake and Yang that Ruby has a crush, and it's just as obvious that she'll be much happier once she actually confesses. So they agree to work together and set up the most romantic evening possible for their teammate and the object of her affections. There's just one minor issue:
Yang thought Ruby wished wistfully for Weiss, while Blake thought Ruby pined privately for Penny.
Now the night of the 'date' has come and the two must scramble to make sure Ruby doesn't realize what's going on, Weiss and Penny don't stumble on each other, and hope that nobody's hearts are broken.
A romantic comedy of errors, parties, fancy restaurants, rivers, and increasingly panicked teenagers.

Odd feelings aren't the only thing hiding, something far more sinister is shifting in the shadows.ORUseless Lesbian Amity cant seem to figure out her feelings and Luz is just a oblivious, or is she? Plus angsty plot because well as much as you love fluff i know you want me to rip out your heart stomp on it and give it back to you with all that angsty goodness.

    Summary
      Something's wrong but Ruby doesn't know what. It feels like there's some sort of... Barrier, between herself and Weiss. ...Between herself and, anyone really. When she feels compelled to speak, it's to further their plans, point things out, deliver rebuttal to those who refuse to do what's right... It wasn't super apparent at first, she still had some chats with others, she still rode on Elm's shoulders... But, tonight was different. Tonight, it became clear that something other than being tongue tied was at play. She said and did something she never would do. Her lips moved on their own. Her throat was sealed shut as she watched her best friend disappear into the depths of the Schnee Manor.Alone.Completely.Utterly.Alone.
