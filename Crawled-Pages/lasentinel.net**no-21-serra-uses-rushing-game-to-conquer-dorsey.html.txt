The Serra Cavaliers and the Dorsey Dons’ came into their matchup off tough losses. Serra lost a competitive match against Narbonne 14-17 to start their season and succumbed to Punahou High School, which is ranked 63rd in the nation and second in Hawaii.
Dorsey was defeated by Calabasas High School 12-35, a team with a 28 rank in California.
Serra rushed through Dorsey’s defense to earn their first win 44-7 on Friday, September 8. Cavaliers junior Blaze McKibbin made 17 throws for 138 yards, scoring one touchdown.

“I think that Dorsey was really planning to stop our passing game,” said Serra football head coach Scott Altenberg. “I was real proud of our guys to be able to do what they have to do and run in the game.”
Senior Kalen Thomas had 11 carries for 97 yards and two touchdowns. Senior John Jackson made 10 catches for 89 yards and sophomore Justin Houston executed five tackles for the Cavaliers.
Serra moved the ball on the on their first possession and earned a touchdown with a pass to junior D’marcus Jones. Dorsey responded with a deep pass sent to Jordan Wood to tie the game at seven.

Despite having a pass broken by Dons senior Isaiah Smalls, the Cavaliers scored two rushing touchdowns by senior David Eure and Thomas. Senior Bryan Addison picked off Dorsey and the Cavaliers scored in the next play.
“We just had to come out with enthusiasm and take advantage of our key plays,” said Addison. “Our corners were smaller and our run game was dominant.”
By halftime, Serra enforced a 28-7 lead over the Dons. The Cavaliers edged up the score in the early minutes of the second half. The Dons offense pushed down the field through rushes but struggled with venturing beyond the 50 yard-line.
Dorsey head coach Charles Mincy hopes that the Dons will improve from this loss.
“We were at this point last year, we got a tougher schedule than we had last year, way tougher schedule,” Mincy said. “But last year, we took a tough loss early and we got better as the year went on.”
The Dons will host the Lincoln Hornets of San Diego on September 22 at 7:00 P.M. and Serra have a home game against the Alemany Warriors at 7:00 P.M. on September 22.
