    Summary
      The last thing Klaus remembers is holding his sibling's hands as Five jumps them to some other time. But his hand slips and he falls away from the other. Instead of another time he finds himself in a different universe. One where Sir Reginald did not raise The Umbrella Academy to fight crime but to commit it. Klaus knows he should avoid these other versions of his sibs...but when has he ever done things he should? The other versions of his family are darker and a little scary, but at the same time strangely fascinating. Though the biggest difference in this universe is that their Number Four was the one that died.

    Summary
      “Klaus,” Ben warns. “Come on, I’m serious.” “Who says I’m not? I mean, maybe I’m just flattering myself here, maybe seeing anyone’s dick would turn you on after all this time, but you sure didn’t seem opposed, at the very least, and I’m pretty sure mine’s the only dick that’s attached to someone who can even make this offer.” He fixes Ben with a look, “And, uh, just to be crystal-fucking-clear here? I am, in fact, offering.”***EDITED AND UPDATED 9/28, CHAPTER 3 COMING SOON!!!***

    Summary
      This was supposed to be some alone time, some bonding without the other prying ears. Sure, One had some work to do and an assignment to complete, but all Klaus had to do was just tag along and leave the dangerous stuff to him. And, yeah, maybe he didn't tell Klaus right away that this was more of a business trip than a road trip, but he'll get over it.At least they’re together, right? "I was perfectly content with staying home and using Christopher as a footrest but no, you had to promise me jupiter and only give me pluto.""In my defense," One muttered, eyes momentarily darting to his mirror, "you cut me off before I even got a chance to explain what you were agreeing to."(Or the instance where Sparrow's Number One brings Klaus with him on a mission)((A Continuation of A Little Birdy Told Me You Were Interested))

    Summary
      One tap. Two taps. A screech from the rusty microphone.
The crowd stilled. Everything fell quiet, not even a chirp of a bird in the distance. In unison, everyone’s hearts stopped beating, warm summer air was held deep in their lungs. Time stopped flowing, freezing the frame of the beautiful, sunny noon in a pitiful caricature. Blue skies, hardly a cloud in sight, blooming trees and people - sunken cheeks, vacant eyes, dirty skin.
Then, shiny red heels clicked as the woman on the podium fidgeted in unfamiliar excitement. Her crimson painted lips parted, and through came the memorized ode to the nation,
“Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor!”

    Summary
      Ben turned to him with a glare that stunned him for a few good seconds because that, coupled with the facial scar and the spiky hair he had failed to tame, reminded Klaus of Sparrow Ben just before he unleashed The Horrors on him. “How much longer do you intend to keep that secret from them?”Here we go again.

    Summary
      The future to where they come back to is... different. The price they paid for a world without the Apocalypse is not obvious at first, but it soon becomes apparent that they had lost people and memories of a past that never was, and gained a whole array of different ones. But Klaus has to admit, this... internet thing, this is interesting. 
-
Aka.: They come back from the sixties to a world where there is a thing called internet, and nobody is sure if that is a good thing or not.
