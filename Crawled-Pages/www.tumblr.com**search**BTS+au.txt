(Although in your case, some of the things fate had sent your way could be considered kind of hilarious, in hindsight.) Honestly, you used to not be sure if you even believed in fate, but there comes a point when the things that happen to oneself seem too beautifully ironic to be mere coincidence, and you’d reached that point.Was it fate that that perfect building on the corner came up for sale right when you were looking for a place to open your coffee shop? Was it fate that you and Park Jimin visited that same clinic on the same day? And, most importantly, was it fate that out of all the women in the world to be accidentally artificially inseminated and wind up pregnant with his baby, it was your virgin self?No, that last sentence was not a joke and you absolutely wished it was.Somehow, either by providence, medical malpractice, or the beauty of human error, (or some unfathomable combination of all three) your simple check-up with the gynecologist all those months ago had resulted in you being mistakenly artificially inseminated with a sample from a man you had never even met. And as if all of that wasn’t insane enough on its own, to top it all off, you also happened to be a virgin. And now you were pregnant. You were a pregnant virgin.Like they say, fate is a funny thing, and in your case, it was fucking hilarious. Keep reading

“At the center of Greek mythology is a pantheon of deities who live on Mount Olympus, the highest mountain in Greece. Every aspect of human life was ruled by these deities. There were twelve main Olympians who ruled over such aspects. Olympian gods and goddesses are said to look much like women and men of this world but could also change their appearances into whatever they liked, animals and things of that nature. Most people know of the common gods, such as Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. But, there are others such as Dionysus- the god of wine, Aphrodite- the goddess of beauty and love, and even Hermes- the god of travel, who was in fact the personal messenger of Zeus. If you’ve watched the movie Hercules you’ll-” Professor Song’s voice becomes drowned out by the snort that comes from your left. You roll your eyes before craning your neck forward to keep listening to the lecture. You’ve always had an affinity to mythology of any kind since you were a child but, as you grew up Greek mythology stood out the most to you. You became enamored with it and decided to become a mythologist. You’ve heard of these tales countless times but you could always hear them once more.
A cough comes from next to you as you listen to the tale of Hephaestus and you roll your eyes once more before putting your hand underneath your chin. You jot down notes dutifully before looking up as Professor Song begins to wrap up the class. “For the last portion of your grade, you will all be assigned to work with a partner. The theme of your project is Graceful Gods, a study on partnerships between the gods and goddesses. You may choose whichever two gods and goddesses you may like that have had a connection with one another. Now, this doesn’t mean to watch Hercules a bunch of times and comment on those relationships between cartoons.” The class erupts into small giggles and you find yourself snorting at the lame joke. “Since I know that most of you cannot put yourselves together properly, looking at you Haeyun and Jowoon-” You giggle at his call out before paying attention again, “-you will all work with the person directly next to you at your tables.” Your eyes glance over to the long haired boy by next to you and you inwardly groan.

Well, you would have thought they were crazy. But here you are, with three different packs of hybrids that don’t get along – but all want to stay with you.Yeah, turns out crazy is an understatement.— pairing: hybrid bts x human reader— genre: fluff, angst, eventual smut— word count: 6k— tag list: @keijaycreates​ @xsmilebitesx​ @ditttiii​ @ayoo-bangtan​ @see3milyblog​ @faithsummers11​ @narcissism-iskey​ @sp3ak-yours3lf​ @cesthoney​ @imluckybitches​ @multifandomgirl29​ @moon-2seok​​ @bangtansleftnut​ @murderyoursoul​ @hd-junglebook​ @sweeneyblue1 @hear-me-growl​ @bubbletae7​ @wxnterbears​ @crazed-abstractionists​ @serious-addiction​ @lorielulu7​ @spiritrosegaby​ @1am9root6​ @bubbletaetaesstuff​ @thebluecupcakequeen​ @littlewolfieposts​ @sana-b​ @novastarpie​ @jiminsangelqueen @diamonddia-mond​ @shortpeoplematter​ @myhearttteu​ @jiminot7​ @rosiethefairy​ @m0chilattae​ @lovinggalaxies​ @anothershorthuman​ @trinityautumn​ @delightfulknightpeachweasel​ @just-a-little-teapot13 @midnight1199​ @fearhoshi​ @ess-place @hoseokslefteyebrow​ @dinorahrodriguez​Part: I / II / III / V / VI / VIII / IX / XYou can’t help but gape at the two giants in front of you. When you met the two hybrids in their animal form, you never expected that they would be two tall, broad-shouldered and muscular men. Maybe it was a little wrong of you to just assume that they would be tiny in their human forms as well, but you couldn’t picture them as anything else when you tried. Obviously, by looking at the sight in front of you – you were very wrong. Brown bunny ears suddenly rise straight up in alarm as the hybrid notices your presence in the room. His nose twitches rapidly, eyes growing wide as he finally places the weird smell that entered the room with you. Predator. He makes a choked sound, backing up until he collides with the other hybrid’s back.The other man spins around at the sound of his pack mate’s distress, arms quickly pushing the bunny hybrid behind his back. The hamster hybrid fixes you with a hard glare, nostrils flaring as he inhales the same scent.Yeonjun hurries into the room, placing himself between you and the two hybrids. “As you saw the first time you visited, we keep predator and pray hybrids separate. Even though they’re more human than animal, there are still strong instincts in their genetic code that aren’t always so easy to fight against, no matter how much the human part wishes to,” Yeonjun explains to you slowly, eyes trained on the two men as he tries to lessen the tense atmosphere.

Of course, the execution was a bit poor… and embarrassing. But hey, if rocking up to cheer practice in a skirt doesn’t woo your crush, what will?masterlist | — posted; 01.03.2020TUESDAY, SEMESTER 2 WEEK FOURIt’s a beautiful day, the sun has
just come to peak out from behind the clouds that had earlier obscured its
climb from the horizon, and the grass of the Biological Sciences Library
courtyard glistens with raindrops left over from the brief shower that prefaced
the sun’s belated appearance. Students are finally beginning to emerge from the
safety of the undercover walkways and overhangs, venturing boldly to shortcut
over the grass. University life resumes, and everything falls back into its
place, all as usual.“Yah, is that Jungkook? Wait what is
he—”Well, everything except for one
thing.A red and black-clad figure slams to
a stop right where two students are sitting and minding their own business
outside the café attached to the back of the library—there’s no time to say
hello. The table rocks dangerously on its beaten, metal leg, the impact of
Jungkook’s beeline almost sending it straight to the ground if the two others
weren’t already seated there to catch it.“OW!” Jimin is never one to be quiet
in his complaints, all too happy to holler his outrage at the top of his lungs.
As his oldest hyung would say, no attention is bad attention. “Hey you
almost jammed my fingers!”Startled as Taehyung might have been,
his focus is quickly shifted to other things. His wide eyes scan Jungkook’s
panting form, taking in the clothes clinging to him like a second skin and the
beet red colour of his face and ears. It’s not hard to put two and two
together, but what comes out of his mouth isn’t exactly the most pressing thing
he wants to ask, “Jungkook, why are you wearing the female cheer leading
uniform I gave you?”There’s a somewhat crazed look that
makes itself known in the youngest’s eyes. “AHA!” he throws a finger in
Taehyungs face, accusing. “So you ADMIT it’s a female uniform! Taehyung, you ass,
how could you!” Keep reading

            much better: the afterglow (m)        pairing— kim taehyung x reader from my fic: much bettergenre— established relationship, tattooed and pierced!taehyung, smut, fluff, comedy, a little bit of angstwarnings— dom!taehyung, sex toys (hitachi), rough sex, dirty talk + degradation, spanking, oral (female receiving), use of a sex bench, unprotected sex + creampie/cumplayword count— 8kabout— the first big fight with your boyfriend, taehyung, leads to something bigger… and better.author’s note: ahhhh my first commissioned piece finally done! thank you so much 🐻 for being so patient and lovely throughout this whole process, ily and i hope you enjoy this 💗! “I’m surprised how well everything is coming along. If it all goes to plan, we can reopen next Friday— Oh, Y/N! Watch out!”Even with Jimin’s advanced warning, you still almost stumble into the small pile of discarded rubbish placed haphazardly on the side of the Club Singularity’s first floor bar area. Luckily for you, Taehyung has quicker reflexes, wrapping his arm around your waist and pulling you towards him so quickly that you crash against his chest. But hey, your boyfriend’s strong chest probably feels a hell of a lot better than falling face first onto a bunch of  wooden planks.When you glance up at him, Taehyung’s worried puppy dog gaze is already looking down at you. And so you grin at him with a thank you, and relief softens his features. Keep reading

            wartime child        synopsis. raising a baby in wartime isn’t easy. but when your baby starts showing signs of magical abilities, you’re forced to ring up the only other person you know he takes after: jeon jungkook.genre. loosely based of the harry potter universe. wizard au. dad au.words. 12.1kxit must be five o’clock somewhere. that is, if there is a part of the world that isn’t shrouded with ash grey clouds and recurring thunder of the mighty zeus. you don’t know - nobody does - but something’s very wrong somewhere upstairs. the newscaster’s words in the background is too fast to catch. you pace back and forth, anxious, restless. until you realize the thudding sound couldn’t have come from you - couldn’t have come from human footsteps.the door.you peek through the hole, relief washing over you as soon as you see the lock of brownish hair.“___, hi-” his greetings are cut short as you pull him in, slamming the door behind you and making sure each lock is secured.“it’s starting,” you say, almost sounding mad if it wasn’t for the baby you gave birth to ten months ago upstairs, “the first time i noticed, he was on the floor instead of the crib. i thought maybe he just crawled out but then the second time, i know and you know how i know? mr. tubs was floating past me while i was changing his diaper, jungkook,” you pause, eyes widened like a mad man, “the cat was fucking floating!”jungkook calls your name, the voice you would usually find soothing is now a dread than a relaxant. but then again, it was never the voice. it was-“mommy!” your baby reaches out his pudgy hands as the nursery door swings open.there’s a still pause as you wait for something to fly at you. or float past you. or your own baby start drifting in the air like a balloon. but nothing.“i swear, he has it too, kook.” you hold your baby in your arms, glancing over the man as though begging for him to trust you. as if you’re the crazy one! can you believe it? you! two years ago, you were just a waitress of a diner downtown, trying to get by. if you could take it all back, if you could press a reverse button and turn down that handsome charmer that sat by the window, reading a book (except it wasn’t any ordinary book that you can get a hard copy of - it was a spell book) instead of being on his phones like anyone his age would be doing, you would in a heartbeat.
