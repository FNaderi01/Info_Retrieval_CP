                                                    Can I just say, that I laugh more with their vlogs than I think I did with any of their other videos. I thinks it‚Äôs cause they‚Äôre a lot happier than they were in their previous videos.I actually think I may cry the next time I see them being genuine fucking people. I want to be like them. I want the self care they‚Äôre giving themselves and getting from other people, I need their confidence in themselves and finally I think I just want to actually be fucking healthy like they are mentally, emotionally, physically, etc. Growing up with my family being they way they are may have messed me up a little bit, but I want to get better, I just want to be happy with myself and I don‚Äôt know where or how to start. I want confidence. I want true happiness. I want to be happy with who I am. And as I write this, I sang a song so loud I hurt my throat and coughed and realized that they genuinely make me happy with myself and just happy in general, but it‚Äôs only a temporary solution, but it works for right now. I‚Äôll get the help I need when I can afford it and when it‚Äôs available, but for right now they make me happy.Especially in this part of the videoüëáüèª

ALWAYS CHOOSE YOUR RENT.Food pantries are a punch in the nuts to your pride but they require WAY less hoops to jump through to get than the financial side of housing assistance. Also, there is often going to be MORE RESOURCES AVAILABLE for you when it comes to food assistance of MULTIPLE TYPES (food stamps/ebt, places that double said EBT, food pantries, places that just give away free food like soup kitchens, places that give away their leftovers from the day before etc) rather than housing assistance which are neither numerous nor are people likely to apply for.I personally have used food pantries. I may have to use them again. They are there to help you for that reason, okay? Please fucking choose to pay your rent until we can abolish landlords and live on mutual aid. Stay housed. Do you hear me, if this choice happens, seek mutual aid or charity for food and STAY HOUSED. Statistically, it is better to take the hit to your pride, go ask for food assistance, and sleep in your bed and eat that food in your home because coming back from losing said home is going to be so much harder that recovering from food insecurity is. ITS FUCKED UP THAT WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BUT PLEASE TRUST ME ON THIS ONE OK? JUST TRUST ME.
