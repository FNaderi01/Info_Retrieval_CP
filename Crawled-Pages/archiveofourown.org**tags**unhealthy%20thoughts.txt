    Summary
  Lance is easily, humanly pretty.
  It's the kind of beauty that makes Shiro’s teeth hurt, right in the molars, a feel of rush and pain. A throb of bloodflow in his mouth and the pounding of heartbeat in his jaws.
  The kind of beauty Shiro's afraid to touch.
When Shiro pines, he pines hard.

Autoerotic Asphyxiation Choking Masochism Disturbing Themes Humiliation kink Verbal Humiliation Name-Calling its all fantasy tho filthy filthy fantasies Experimental Style Lance is pining Masochist Lance
    Summary
  Lance has to be really, really careful about Shiro – ‘cause it’s Takashi Shirogane, star pilot, spaceman fantasy of his dreams, packaged and wrapped up like a toy he wanted for his birthday for years. Lance will just – just chew him up, tear his circuits apart with his own teeth, spit him out for fun. And Lance, god, when Lance is done, he’ll just leave Shiro’s batteries dead and acrid and leaking acid, corroded to hell and back from overuse and undercare. 
Lance doesn't pine, he hungers like a goddamn bloodthirsty witch.

    Summary
      Jerome had never had many things in his life, but he knew he could have her. And everyone in Gotham would see them together and know – know that she was his and, a small part of him whispered, that he was hers. Because Jerome had never liked being caged, but if it was her holding the key, he thought he wouldn’t mind so much.
Jerome, after the carnival, after the chaos, after the room of mirrors, found only one thing occupying his thoughts.

      No tenía ningún derecho de sentirse así, claro está, porque no era nada de él, nada más que un compañero de clase y un amigo lejano, ni siquiera uno de sus mejores amigos, ni siquiera uno de los amigos cercanos con los que almorzaba o entrenaba en clase o pasaba el tiempo durante los descansos. No era nada de él, así que tener celos era una ridiculez.Pero, por supuesto, él no estaba celoso.

    Summary
      They’re in her tiny apartment bathroom, her sitting on the closed toilet lid and him crouched on the bathmat in front of her. He’s busy cleaning off her knees, picking the sidewalk grit from the scrapes and wiping the crimson streaks from her legs. It’s weirdly intimate, or it should be, but it’s just intimate and not weird at all, really. Dani wonders if it would be out of place to put on a quiet Spotify playlist and maybe stroke his loose hair.(In which Dani is held before she ever sets foot on Swedish soil.)
