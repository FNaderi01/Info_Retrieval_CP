    Summary
      Growing up in the dystopian remains of a country once known as Japan, Kotomi Fujisaki was sure all she needed in life were her closest friends, a good book, and her favorite plum tree, where she and her loved ones spent their quiet and tranquil childhoods. 
But when her friends are deployed to defend their crumbling borders from encroaching outsiders known as Wastelanders, her normal life is turned upside down. She finds that the war, once far from sight and out of mind, had come right to her doorstep. 
Literally. 
OC/VariousMilitary!Dystopian!AUBased loosely on Gusari's Battle Deployment series.

    Summary
      [Name] [Last Name], a 2nd year at Karasuno High and the sports medic of the volleyball team. Although she gets mistaken for a manager, she’s actually the nurse for the volleyball team. [Name] is a sports medic because she wishes to be a sports medic for professionals and help those who injure themselves in playing a sport she loves; volleyball. She has quite the history to her and has family issues that she doesn’t talk openly about. During the start of the year, she’s suspended for a month of club activities due to a physical altercation with someone outside of school. Hopefully, she doesn’t have anymore problems as she tries to help her boys get to nationals and tries not to catch the attention of others since she already has the ace from Shiratorizawa.

    Summary
      They call it a "place"I call it the "escape"Would you really want to accept any consequences just to afford the desire of yourself to feel the unfamiliar feelings to complete you? Can people really feel contented if they already found their escape to reality? Even though it's just for temporary not permanently, because the only permanent in this world is "Change"

    Summary
      “What if I get a boyfriend though? I’ll need to add his phone number when we start dating.”Yuji looked at you with a betrayed expression, but quickly changed it to a grin once he saw the teasing glint in your eyes.“Like I said, you won’t need anymore phone numbers.”“But then how will I contact him?”“Don’t worry. His number is already in your contacts.”You smiled, realizing what he was saying. But you weren’t going to let him go that easily.“Hmm, I see.”He nodded along with you, thinking that you understood the underlying meaning behind his words.“So you’re saying that I’ll date someone who’s already on my phone.”“Yup.”“So, Bobata is going to be my boyfriend?”“Yup yup-wait what?”

      Ennosita centric/centered mafia auEnnoshita Chikara is a coward.an incident that left his best friends - his brothers- Kinnoshita and Narita dead causes an argument with Daichi and Ennoshita, causing him to leave the Karasuno yakuza group for good.For the next five years Ennoshita stays hidden, not making any contact with his former members that he had half of his life with.Within 48 hours though, Ennoshita ends up knocking out a snake, gets his apartment burned down to the ground while finding out that he’s been stalked by a not so surprising pudding head, and reunites with his former members only to have Daichi san to be “dead”, expecting him to lead Karasuno despite running away from them for the past five years.Oh, and also, Kenma decides to name his new cat Chikara sometime in between all that, while Akashi may or may not found out a new talent just to annoy him.With Daichi gone, old tensions and rivalries arise from Shiratoriwaza and Sehjoh, but there are bigger problems at hand.Karasuno is broken more than they seem, and it's Ennoshita's job to fix it.But can he?This is the story of Ennoshita’s redemption from running away from the family he once called home.
