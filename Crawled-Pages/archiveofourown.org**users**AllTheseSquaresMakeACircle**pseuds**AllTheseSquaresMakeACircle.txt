    Summary
      Geralt had no idea how he had landed himself with Jaskier. Nor did he look that far into it. It didn't seem to matter all that much. Given how close the two of them had gotten. And, it seemed, that they were going to get even closer.

    Summary
      Derek had come back to Beacon Hills to reclaim his family's ancestral home. After the fire. After Kate, it was time they took it back. Too bad hunters with an ax to grind followed him. But as it turned out, he had an unlikely ally in all of it. Just as his newly made pack is about to be torn apart, he meets a Fae. Rather, a smart mouthed twenty something with doe eyes, and lips as sharp as sin. Fuck his life.

    Summary
      Stiles was a simple boy from a simple town. His father was a lawman, and they made better money than most. But they needed more. And as it turned out, the royal family was in need of hands. Stiles expected to be worked half to death, with hardly an ounce of rest. What he got was a foul tempered alpha with trust issues, and a family that spoke in riddles rather than their actual feelings. At least the pay was good.

    Summary
      Stiles and his father were moving to a new town, along with Scott and Lydia. The three of them being demigods, at times, tended to complicate things. Especially since Stiles' mother was an elder goddess. He only hoped that if there were any gods that nestled in their new town, they would at least be able to get along. As it turned out, there was one. And they got along more than well. And Stiles had no issue with that whatsoever.

    Summary
      January seventh. Seven days since the start of 2015, and seven days since his father’s death.The bastard, he thinks bitterly. The past year Derek Hale had made it blatantly obvious that he hated his scrawny guts, taking every given opportunity to shove him up against a wall, growl threats in his ears and roll his eyes whenever he stepped into the room, muttering some snide comment about how spastic or idiotic he was.So why did he fucking volunteer to take him in?
