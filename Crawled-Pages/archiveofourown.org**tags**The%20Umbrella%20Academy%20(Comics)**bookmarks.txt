    Summary
      Eudora paused to take a breath, clearly readying herself. Everyone in the room tensed, strung like a bow for the news they all saw coming but not this soon."Your brother Klaus was found earlier this morning. He was dead before paramedics arrived. He couldn't be revived." Or: The apocalypse is averted, the gang DOESN'T go back in time, and Klaus dies... But only long enough to hurt.Very self-indulgent stuff.**********Read tags.

    Summary
      In 2006, the Umbrella Academy was a power house of vigilante justice, revered by the masses and ready to protect the world!  Until it, like one of its members, faced a tragic and unexpected end.This is the story of how the Umbrella Academy operated: the shared joys and sorrows experienced by its extraordinary teenage superheroes, who unwittingly lived their lives sheltered within its walls and stunted by its structure.   This is also the story of how the Umbrella Academy dissolved, and with it, the lives of those who survived.In other words: the novel-length, canon-compliant, zany, sad, and cathartic prequel that you never knew you needed.

    Summary
      This is not a ship fic. This is anti-Allison/Luther.Since meeting Raymond, something had shifted deep inside her. A realisation that her and Luther had never truly been in love- on her part, it had been a desperate plea for any kind of affection. On his part, he’d been under her control all this time. She had expected her wish to fade away over time, especially during the years they’d spent apart, but had arrived at her father’s funeral to find Luther couldn’t move on. He still looked at her as if she was the entire world. Without even realising it, Allison had been holding him hostage for… how many years now? Looking at him now, (how different he looked to when she’d last seen him), she couldn’t help wondering what Luther would be like if she’d never made her wish.There was no doubt in her mind that he would be happier.

    Summary
      She’d retreated within herself, able to keep calm so long as she remained inside the locked closet with those men far away from her. Their voices permeated the periphery of her enclosed world, but being able to hear them in the distance assured her they weren’t currently coming towards her, so, in a way, it was a comforting noise. Her main guiding hope, however, was that her family were coming for her.

    Summary
      “So are we going or what?” says Klaus lightly. “Do I have to put on one of your tragic uniforms?”“No,” says Not-Ben through gritted teeth, “but at the very least, could you find a shirt that covers your nipples? Or are you allergic to buttons?”“Oh, I love buttons,” says Klaus. “I love to push them. The 2000s are calling, by the way; they want their emo fringe back.” The Hargreeves adjust to life in the Sparrow Academy. Post-S2, spoilers for finale

    Summary
      “Something’s up with them.” 
“And what are you going to do about it?” 
“WE are going to spy on them. Obviously.” 
“Looks like we’ll be going on a family road trip after all. Yay!” 
Or, the Hargreeves siblings know something’s up with Ben and Vanya. They’re goal is to follow them on their trip to the west coast without being detected. Spoiler alert, they’re really bad at it. 
(Also, some things are unpacked, but it's alright in the end).

    Summary
      “Why would you do that?” Vanya asks. “After what I did to you-”“There’s not that many people who can understand how it feels to be raised by Reginald Hargreeves, you know,” Klaus contributes. “If you’re gone too, who are we going to tell our trauma to? A therapist? Ha. Hard pass.” “But I-” Vanya starts to protest, but then Allison’s arms are slung around her shoulders, and she buries her face in her hair, and for a second Ben lets himself hope everything will be alright in the end.(Once again, the Umbrella Academy saves the day - not that the day cares much about it one way or another.)
