The Battle of Cape Palos was a naval engagement between 9 and 10 June 1758 near Cape Palos, during the Spanish-Barbary Wars. A Spanish squadron of three warships intercepted an Algerian squadron of two warships escorting a prize ship. After a prolonged fight, the Algiers flagship surrendered. His consort eluded the battle, but wrecked and the prize ship escaped. Algiers flagship sank from the damage, but there were several prisoners and Christian slaves released.

Background[edit]
Since the 16th century, Barbary corsairs had become a problem for Christian countries in the Mediterranean, looting their ships and enslaving their crews in their commercial raids. Many daring corsairs even raided coastal villages and kidnapped villagers to sell as slaves. This formed a significant part of the economies of the Barbary states, which were autonomous vassals of the Ottoman Empire. On the Spanish coasts of the Levante, the Algerians were the most annoying.[1] 
After the Treaty of Aachen of 1748, with which Spain entered peace, the Marquis of Ensenada focused from that moment on the Barbary threat, gathering two naval divisions with the aim of engaging with the Barbary corsairs.[2] In addition, this measure sought to prevent the sailors of the Spanish fleet from remaining inactive and losing any experience they had gained from the war.[2] Both divisions were dispatched to patrol the Barbary coast, where Barbary galliots and other minor warships were frequently captured by the Spanish, but no significant engagement took place until November 1751.
On that date a Spanish squadron and an Algerian squadron fought off Cape St Vincent. During battle, the Algerian 60-gun ship of the line Danzik, the flagship of the Algiers, was destroyed. But her consort, the ship of the line Castillo Nuevo, managed to escape, becoming Algiers' new flagship.[3] In the following years, from 1752 to 1757, there were minor Spanish victories over the Barbary corsairs,[4] until in 1758 another battle took place in which the Castillo Nuevo participated again.
Battle[edit]
  The Barbary corsairs used to use small vessels in their raids, but from the 18th century they began to have ships comparable to Europeans.[1] In the image you can see the destruction of a large Barbary ship.
On 2 June 1758, three Spanish ships left Cartagena under the command of Captain Isidoro García del Postigo to patrol the coast and drive away Algerian ships. They were 68-gun three ships of the line called Soberano, Vencedor and Héctor, commanded respectively by the Captain García del Postigo, Captain Francisco Tilly and Captain Fernando del Campillo. The head of the Spanish division was García del Postigo.[3] 
At eight o'clock in the morning of 9 June, near Cape Palos, the Spaniards spotted three suspicious ships and began the persecution to recognize them. At two in the afternoon, the Algerian prize ship, broke away and fled to the SSE, while Algerian warships turned north and hoisted the Algiers flag an hour later, ready to cover its withdrawal.[3] These were the 60-gun ship of the line Castillo Nuevo (flagship) and the 40-gun frigate Caravela,[5] commanded respectively by Arráez[A] Mahamud Rais and the turncoat Achí Mustafá. The Spaniards hoisted British flags on their ships to get close enough, although the trick was not useful due to the Algerian fighting attitude.[3]
At half past four in the afternoon, the Spanish and Algerian ships were within walking distance, so the Spaniards hoisted their own flag on their ships and began the battle. Soon the Caravela separated from the Castillo Nuevo and began to escape, being persecuted by the Héctor.[5] Battle was divided into two parts: the Soberano and Vencedor against the Castillo Nuevo, and the Héctor against the Caravela.[7]  
The Soberano and Vencedor were kept at a distance from the Castillo Nuevo, taking advantage of the greater range and firepower of their guns to attack it.[7] However, that prolonged the battle due to the low impact power of the bullets[B] and the obtuse resistance of the Algerians.[7] The Spaniards first used bullet charges and then shrapnel so as not to inflict more damage on the hull of the Castillo Nuevo and be able to capture it.[7] At eleven o'clock at night, the Algerian ship was completely dismantled, and at twelve o'clock the Spaniards stopped the attack to rest.[6] Finally, at one o'clock in the morning, he surrendered.[5] At dawn, the Spaniards sent boats to evacuate the Algerian survivors from the ship, which was sinking due to the damage it received in battle.[5] The Algerians had more than 100 killed in battle, 44 drowned and 306 prisoners; including Mahamud Rais and 3 officers.[6] 53 Christian slaves (Dutch, German and one Irish) were released.[6] The Spanish casualties between the two ships were scarce: 2 killed, 11 wounded and some bruises.[6] According to the Spanish historian Fernández Duro, the few Spanish casualties are due to the mishandling of the guns by the corsairs.[5]
On the other hand, Héctor had been chasing the Caravela until he reached the same coast of Barbary.[5] From half past five in the afternoon he attacked her with his bow guns to stop her, while the frigate fled and responded to the attack.[6] Soon the Algerian ship was dismantled and blocked against the coast, but at that time a squall of the NE appeared that forced the Spanish ship, with damage to the rigging, to separate from its opponent, without seeing it again.[8] Héctor only had 1 wounded and some bruises.[9]
When the three Spanish ships met, they began the search for the Caravela. The search extended until 12 June, when they found a shipwreck near Alhucemas, assuming their loss.[9] As for the prize ship that escaped, the Spaniards discovered by information of the liberated that it was a Hamburg ship with a rich cargo that had been captured by the Algerians before, being the reason why the Algerian warships were sacrificed.[6]
Spanish ships spent many munitions in battle because the shots were fired at a distance, but caused the dismantling of the Algerian ships.[9] Spanish historian Rodríguez González considers it impossible that the frigate has survived after receiving so much damage.[9] He also considers that despite the Spanish superiority, the victory achieved by García del Postigo  is remarkable due to the few casualties and the good effect of the ranged attack, which justifies spending on ammunition.[9] The historian attributes the same credit to the ship of the line when it chases a frigate, which is generally faster and more maneuverable.[10]
Aftermath[edit]
With this battle, the Spanish Navy destroyed the third flagship of the Regency of Algiers in the 18th century; the second had been the aforementioned Danzik in 1751, and the first, a 60-gun ship of the line destroyed in 1732.[C] But despite the Spanish victory, the Barbary corsairs continued to threaten and harass Spanish merchant ships. 
Later, King Charles III of Spain would seek to solve the problem of the corsairs of Algiers, through both military and diplomatic channels. In 1775, he sent an expedition to Algiers, supported by the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, to deal a great blow to the Algerians, but the expedition ended in resounding failure. Given this fact, the Spanish government would give emphasis to the diplomatic solution, but with negative results. This led Spain to resort to military means again with the bombardment of Algiers in 1783 and then in 1784, carrying out the second attack with the support of the Two Sicilies, Portugal and the Malta. The Regency of Algiers, after these attacks, was willing to seek peace with Spain, signing a treaty in 1786 that ended more than two hundred years of war between Spain and Algiers.[11] On those same dates, Spain also reached peace agreements with the Ottoman Empire and other Barbary states. This marked the end of Barbary piracy and slave trade in the Mediterranean against the Spanish.

Notes[edit]
^ “Arráez” is the Moorish equivalent of commander.[6]
^ In this period, the impact power of the projectiles was much lower, since the guns had a low ejection speed when firing.[7]
^ The first of these ships, that of 1732, was destroyed by Blas de Lezo in the Mostaganem cove, where it was anchored and guarded by Algerian coastal batteries.[10]
