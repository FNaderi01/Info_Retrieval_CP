      Chapter 13: An alien learns about Cookies
    Chapter Text
    It's late in the evening as we leave the fair, the smell of oil and hot sugar dwindles as the distance between us and the fair grows. I take a deep breath of the cooling night air. "I want to walk around alone for a bit.""Are you okay Luz? I'm sorry, I know the fair was kind of a mess but-" Willow started to apologize."Oh no, the fair was lovely actually. I just kinda like that I can wander around outside without supervision." I put a hand on Willow's shoulder.Gus looked concerned. "You are only 14 right? I'm not sure that's safe.""I've been to a planet full of alien parasites that reanimate corpses to pilot around as hosts, and I've been to a planet that's alive and made of teeth, but Earth? That's apparently the scary one." I scoff and shake my head. "I'll be fine, the only thing to fear is terminal velocity.""We have a similar expression on Earth. 'The only thing to fear is fear itself.'" Willow chimed in.I tilt my head to the side. "You aren't afraid of terminal velocity?"Willow shrugged. "That doesn't really come up in day-to-day life."---I enjoyed exploring the human town at my leisure, as opposed to panicked sprinting about the road with threatening beings on my tail. As I reminisced I put a hand to the road, it still seemed to be burning hot from the day's heat yet not enough to cause injury. I stood back up, it's funny that this 'road' isn't actually a defensive measure, it could probably repel an enemy... Perhaps this is why humans have shoes? To avoid damage from their own constructs?I walked along the sidewalk, it's like a street but for people even though people are already allowed to walk on streets. As I walked I started to hear additional footsteps echoing with my own. I glance over my shoulder and notice a human is also enjoying a late evening walk... wearing a jacket. This seems odd, I think humans feel cold more easily but not quite to that degree. I cross the street and glance back again, they also cross the street.Is this an agent looking to recapture me? I didn't think my human disguise was compromised but I did frequently refer to humans like a different species several times very loudly throughout the day. Maybe Willow was right about not yelling about humans having blood from a height.The mystery human suddenly stops. Just then I hear the sound of human shoes hitting the ground rapidly in front of me. "Hey! I've been looking everywhere for you!" I tense up, approaching me is a group of humans I've never seen before. Is it more Empyrean agents and I've been chased into a trap? Maybe my randomized human appearance actually matches up with an already existing human and I've been mistaken for them? As the leading person got close enough they quickly whispered. "Some creep is following you, pretend you know me." Her backup humans looked hostile but it seemed aimed behind me."O-oh, yeah hi! I'm definitely here now!" I glanced back again and the mystery human crossed the street, I couldn't make out their face but I feel they are still looking at me over their shoulder.The new mystery human sighed once the other stranger was out of sight. "Are you alright?" I cautiously nod my head. This new human also had dark clothes unsuitable for hot weather, but it didn't seem to be with a purpose to conceal insidious intent. "My friends and I were going to Starbucks, how about you join us just in case that guy comes back?""O-ok... I um, my name is Luz.""Amity."---"You seem a little stressed." Amity seemed to be aware of my nervous glances out the Starbucks window. "Can I buy you a coffee?""I'm not really allowed coffee.""Fair enough, it would probably just make you more jittery anyway." Amity pondered a moment. "How about a chocolate chip cookie then?""What's that?""A chocolate chip cookie?" Amity seemed baffled.Boscha leaned over to Amity. "This girl's definitely a crazy shut-in.""Pssh, I'm joking!" I waved off. "I'd love a... chip cookie. It's my favorite kind of... chip?"Amity chuckled a little. "Okay Luz, I'll be right back." She stood up and left to acquire the... food? Chips and cookies seem to either be food terms or computer terms but this establishment seems to be food oriented so food is a safe bet.I decided to attempt conversation. "So... Boscha...""Don't talk to me, I'm trying to take a good picture of my coffee." Boscha carefully angled her phone above her drink.I decided not to attempt conversation. As Boscha continued her efforts to accurately document her beverage I went back to looking out the window until Amity returned. "Here you are Luz." She handed me a circular object."Thank you." I took the circle and sniffed it. This is almost certainly food. I take a careful bite and my eyes widen."Are you okay Luz?""This is amazing..." I shoved the rest of the chip into my mouth. Once I swallow the food I turn to Amity. "Thank you for this incredible gift.""Well you fed the stray, she'll probably follow you home now.""Shut up Boscha." Amity seemed agitated at her friend, before turning back to me with a gentle smile. "It's nothing, really..." Amity rubbed the back of her neck. "Your eyes really lit up over that cookie.""No they didn't!" I cover my eyes in a panic, although the inside of my palm seems dark. Was that figurative human slang? I'd better act natural. I lower my hand to see a concerned look from Amity, and a few stares from her friends that were paying attention. "I-I mean, the food! It was good, very nice...""Yeah... You're welcome..." Amity said hesitantly.---Amity used her phone to summon her siblings and offered me a ride home, introducing me to Edric and Emira. Their car vehicle smelled nice but I suspect the seats might be made of some kind of skin. Concerns aside I get in the back with Amity and curiously watch her siblings as they get in the front, the male sibling taking the pilot's seat."I didn't know humans had cloning technology." I poked the boy's arm.The human boy Edric laughed. "Amity your new friend is a riot!""We aren't really friends." Amity crossed her arms."We aren't?" I asked in surprised disappointment."Aw Mittens, you made her sad." Emira turned around and stuck out her bottom lip at Amity."I-I mean we just met like an hour ago, it's a little too soon to just decide we're friends..." Amity looked down.I stare out the window. "I suppose that's fair, sometimes you can know someone much longer than that and they'll still hurt you..." I rub at my wrist absently.A hand touches my shoulder and I flinch away. Amity pulls her hand back at my reaction. "Sorry Luz, I didn't mean to startle you. Are you... okay?" Amity asked hesitantly."Oh, no it's fine I was just... somewhere else." I realize I'm still holding my wrist as if it was injured and I quickly let go. I attempted a human smile but it seemed more difficult than usual for some reason.Edric cleared his throat. "So Amity should we drop you off at home first or your... not friend? I know how you are about following your curfew.""Well..." Amity considered for a moment. "Do you have a curfew you need to make Luz?""What's a curfew?""That answers that! So we'll drop Mittens off at home and hang out with Luz." Edric said."You'll take her straight home." Amity said in a strict tone."Worried your 'not friend' will enjoy our company more?" Emira asked."Straight home.""Fiiine." Edric groaned. I again find myself wondering what the protocol is for when drawing out a word like that is appropriate.
