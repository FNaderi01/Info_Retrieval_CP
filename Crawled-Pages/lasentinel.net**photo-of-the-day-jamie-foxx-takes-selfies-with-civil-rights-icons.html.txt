PHOTO of the DAY: JAMIE FOXX TAKES SELFIES WITH CIVIL RIGHTS ICONS            
				By Sentinel News Wire

Ambassador Andrew Young and entertainer Jamie Foxx, right, speak on the sidelines before the NFL Super Bowl 53 football game between the Los Angeles Rams and the New England Patriots, Sunday, Feb. 3, 2019, in Atlanta.

Jamie Foxx took several selfies with civil rights pioneers John Lewis and Andrew Young on the sidelines before kickoff at Super Bowl 53.
After taking pictures with them, Foxx shook Lewis and Young’s hand then told them they inspire him. Lewis and Young were sitting in the back of the golf cart while Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s youngest daughter Bernice King sat in the front.
Beforehand, Foxx strolled down the sideline and took videos of the crowd at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium as many chanted his name before the New England Patriots faced the Los Angeles Rams in Atlanta on Sunday. The Oscar-winning actor said he is a longtime fan of the Dallas Cowboys, but he is rooting for the Patriots.

“I’m going with Tom Brady today,” Foxx said. “I think he’s going to pull it off.”
