So Batman idea where when Harley gets out of Arkham and starts looking for a job and gets one.As Bruce Wayne’s secretary.Just imaging the shenanigans between Bruce and Harley (+batkids)Like she would totally be like April (in parks and rec) for helping Bruce avoid meetings with people he doesn’t like, and would probably come up with the dumbest excuses if he has to run off on Bat business.(She would totally figure it out in the first week or so)Also her just sitting on all meetings and sharing awesome ideas other board members are like“…are we really listening to the convicted felon?”Bruce giving them bat glare “I am listening to Dr Quinzel” unsaid the only person in this room I respect.Just Harley Bruce bromance and Harley being the fun aunt to all the batkids.
