    No Archive Warnings ApplyPeter Nureyev/Juno Steel Rita &amp; Juno SteelPeter Nureyev Juno Steel Rita (Penumbra Podcast) Jet SikuliaqTrauma Mind Control Aftermath &amp; Recovery Juno is still dealing with what happened with the theia Peter doesn’t know about the theia they are learning to talk to each other about things Hurt/Comfort
    Summary
      No one asked about the eye.It wasn't something Peter Nureyev even noticed that he'd noticed, just another unnecessary piece of information filed away in the back of his mind for use later if he needed it. He was doing his best to stay out of Juno Steel's way, after all.No one said anything about the eye - asked any questions, voiced any concerns, made any offers - and Peter put it out of his head.
