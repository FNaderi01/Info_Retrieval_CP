    Summary
      This is a one-shot set within an established relationship between Miranda and Andy.  If you choose to believe that it is part of the Like 'verse that is perfectly fine.  If you don't want it to be part of the Like 'verse that is fine too. :)

    Summary
      This is a collection of short stories set in the Like 'verse.  It is "multichapter" but each chapter will be a stand-alone "Glimpse" into our character's lives.  I will add scenes as they come to me so the overall "Glimpse" file will be open-ended. Updates will definitely be sporadic, at best.

    Summary
      This is a Devil Wears Prada Uber story.  A different version of our favorite ladies twisted into the classic fairy tale world. They don't have the same names as our well known pair, but if Miranda met Maria and Andy met Johanna they would think they were looking into a mirror. It wouldn't bother Cassidy and Caroline so much, because they already know what it's like to have a twin. :)

    Summary
      It's 1925 and jobs aren't easy to come by in New York- especially for fresh-of-the-family-farm girls like Andy. But unlike all those other girls, Andy has a unique talent- even if she doesn't know it herself. A talent that leads her right to Elias Clarke, a relatively new but widely successful fashion magazine and one Miranda Priestly. A crossover of the magical 1920s speakeasy story of the Blind Griffin and The Devil Wears Prada. In summary, witches, fashion and speakeasies!
