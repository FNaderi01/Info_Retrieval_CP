      They’re plainly the cards the universe dealt Atsumu, and now he’s playing poker with the fates, betting his livelihood on every play, solely for the whimsical desire not found in the life of the average man. 
And destiny responds in kind, placing down a card that fourteen-year-old Miya Atsumu could never have predicted.
Destiny gives him Kageyama Tobio.

    Summary
      Hinata Shouyou, son, brother. herbalist, healer, midwife, friend, guardian to one Hinata Natsu. There are many words to describe him, but the default will always be one he was born with, one that he’ll take to his grave.Omega.It’s not like he hated his secondary gender, it’s just that it seemed to hinder his life in a way that neither Betas or Alphas had to deal with. But he learned to use it to his advantage, not allowing anyone to look down on him because of it.Soon enough he became a midwife that helped deliver babies to still living mothers, as well as healing the sick. His skill soon becomes something many high ranking people wish to have in their courts, but no one will force him to live a life he doesn’t want. He is human and he will decide on his future by himself, even if it may cost him his life, at least it was his to live.Hopefully it won’t ever come to that. //Updates every Tuesday, Thursday, and every other Saturday

    Summary
      How can one determine if someone is truly evil? That is a question only the king of Polus could answer.Polus is the kingdom of the mountains. Only the truly heroic and noble live there.Then, there’s Solum, Insulames, and Harena; the earth, the islands, and the desert. Neither the evil nor the pure live there.Finally, there’s Paccator, the caves. Only the truly evil and horrendous live there, Those undeserving of living a quality life among normal and/or noble people, along with their children and family. If one is the child of someone who’s so corrupt and wicked, then it is only presumed that their children and family will be the same way, right?At least that’s what Kageyama, prince of polus, believes.Yet a betrayal happens and Kageyama soon finds himself trapped in Paccator’s caves, and founded by a shapeshifter named Hinata and his friends, children trapped in the caves not by action of their own, but because of their parents.They must work quickly to stop the traitor who took over the throne forcefully.And Kageyama has no choice but to work with these people born of evil.

    Summary

It’s a kitsune mask with delicate red and gold details of sakura petals and koi. Two bells dangle from red ropes on the right side and they make the prettiest sound when they jingle. However, he’s getting tired of looking at it. He wants to know what his face looks like. He was born with this stupid mask and he sure does not want to die with it. There are days when Tobio would try to rip the mask off his face, resulting in rashes and painful tears in his skin. Those days are the worst, always ending with Tobio kneeling in the corner of his room, tears mixed with blood trickling down his face and staining his silk kimonos.

    Summary
  Shouyou heard the music long before he saw its source, and felt it along his skin long before hearing it. Down through the town’s narrow streets he crept, careful of the wet cobblestones and yet still tripping along as he fell toward the melody. The music echoed like a howling beast far out in the foothills on the horizon, but it chilled as if that beast were snarling in your ear. Haloed by the blackness of evening, the sounds dripped with the sweetness of overripe fruit, stung like choking tears, thrilled like that breathless moment before plunging into deep water.
Shouyou finds himself drawn to some things—or someone—he shouldn't.

    Summary
  The world was different when the hero Shouyou returned to Zora’s Domain—brighter and newer, almost, like a flower that no one believed would survive a harsh winter. Leaves stretching, petals translucent. All across Hyrule the air was delicate, the sunrises poignant, and the rain fell on the curving walkways of the palace where Prince Tobio lived leaving behind a scent of resolution.
   A hopeful reunion.

    Summary
      The crow let out a squawk as a bright light enveloped its entire body. Kageyama felt his eyes shut instinctively as he covered them with his hands. The white light continued to shine for a moment before it finally died down. Kageyama let his hands fall to his lap, gasping at what he saw.The crow that he had previously seen was no longer a crow, but a human boy.ORTwist of the Princess and the Frog AU.
