    Summary
      There was a distinctly annoyed and horribly familiar huff behind him. "What a ridiculous waste of time. It is a Friday night, you should be honing your powers, Number Four."And. Klaus. Froze.He felt his shoulders bunch up, all his muscles tensing at the sound of his voice. He squeezed his eyes shut, hoping that he imagined it. But no."I am well-aware that you can hear me, Number Four. Or is this some extension of your irrational fear of the dead? I would've expected you to have moved past that by now, but you always were the weakest of your siblings."---In which Reginald Hargreeves comes back as a ghost and Klaus is left to deal with the fallout.
