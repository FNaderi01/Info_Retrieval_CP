Firstly, that Claire kissing him had been one of the best moments of his life, Secondly, that leaving her house afterwards had been one of the hardest, and thirdly that he needed to invest in some better curtains because the bloody fucking sunshine streaming through the windows was making his hangover ten times worse.Groping clumsily for his phone he felt a little pang of disappointment to see the doctor hadn‚Äôt yet replied to his text wishing her goodnight. Deciding perhaps it was too early in the day, he flopped back onto the bed and let his mind drift back to the events of the evening before.Claire had looked ethereal in the light of the fire and like a bee drawn to a luscious flower, once he‚Äôd felt her soft skin under his fingertips he couldn‚Äôt resist returning again and again. To his delight, she welcomed his touch; pressing into his side when he put an arm around her shoulders and blushing prettily as he swirled patterns across her scapula. When she put her palm on his thigh it almost became too much, the Manny reduced to short shallow breaths as he pictured her wee hand wrapped tightly around his cock.

Hope you enjoy it.thanks to @wickedgoodbooks for the betaAO3PreviousChapter 10: From Posing to Plus OneI adjust the numerous cushions behind me on the purple velvet chaise longue and take another sip from my glass of champagne. This luxurious moment is marred somewhat by the underwire in my strapless bra digging painfully into soft tissue. With my free hand, I surreptitiously try and manoeuvre it into a more comfortable position.‚ÄúClaire, after this we have tae get ye a new bra, fer the dress.‚Äù Geillis has noticed. She notices everything.She is sitting on the edge of a lavender boudoir chair, so full of excitement, I can practically see the air humming around her. She can‚Äôt seem to keep still, her legs constantly jiggling while the fingers of one hand beat a tattoo on the arm of the chair. Despite all the movements, the champagne in her glass remains unspilt, unsurprisingly.Eventually, the sales assistant enters holding aloft a large white garment bag. ‚ÄúHere ye go, ma pet. If ye jes‚Äô want tae pop behind the screen over there, we‚Äôll get ye sorted.‚ÄùGeillis disappears behind the screen, while I continue to savour the champagne and take a good look at my surroundings. This room is like being in a big fluffy cloud. The walls are white with huge white wooden open wardrobes, filled with masses of lace, frills and satin. One wall has a full length mirror set in an ornate gilt frame. The floorboards are painted white as are the shutters at the windows. The only splashes of colour are from the chaise longue and two boudoir chairs, which do look somewhat incongruous against the overwhelming whiteness, like burlesque performers stuck in a room full of angels.But perhaps they couldn‚Äôt risk white seating. All the shuffling bottoms, fake tan and spilt wine would play havoc with pristine upholstery‚Äîless virginal and more slightly seedy and used. The velvet decadence is probably preferable.

Mid-forties and educated at Cambridge, he started his career as an emergency room surgeon before specialising and becoming an anaesthetist. With light brown hair and glacial blue eyes, he was meticulous about his appearance and outside of his surgical scrubs was always impeccably dressed; usually in bespoke suits from Saville Row.Over the years they‚Äôd worked together, he‚Äôd asked Claire out several times, but suspecting the attraction was more about what she represented than who she was as a person, she always declined. Nevertheless, unrequited feelings are a powerful motivator and believing that the adoration she felt for Jamie would never be returned, the doctor had at last accepted Nigel‚Äôs invitation for dinner.With much less excitement that she ought to feel, Claire made her way to the front door to greet her date. Smoothing her dress, she took a fortifying breath and opened the door. ‚ÄúHi Nigel‚ÄùKeep ReadingThank you so much for bearing with me while I had a break.

I smile and gratefully take hold of his forearm until we reach the comparative safety of the marquee.Once inside, Jamie pauses and looks around, trying to find his sister.

I‚Äôm not sure how many of you read on AO3 or exclusively on Tumblr, but due to my Tumblr settings, I am unable to reply to comments and such, but I really do read every single one, and I appreciate them more than I can ever say. So THANK YOU TUMBLR READERS! I LOVE YOU ALL!Claire had only formally requested two days off from the hospital for the entire year: Christmas, and Faith‚Äôs birthday.A month before her birthday, Claire had presented Faith with some options for how they would spend the day. She showed her a picture of the aquarium, a local children‚Äôs theatre giving a sensory friendly showing, and the zoo. She‚Äôd been over the moon at the picture of the zoo, and the choice was quite clear.Claire had started her preparations that day, purchasing tickets to the Bronx Zoo online, and starting to explain to Faith what was expected of her for the day. Every day, Claire would announce how many days until the zoo, and then remind Faith of the itinerary for the day and how she must behave at the zoo.She wanted the day to be perfect.The last birthday Claire had given Faith a genuine celebration was when she turned two. They‚Äôd thrown a party at the house for her first and second birthday consisting of all of Frank‚Äôs family and work friends and a few of Claire‚Äôs friends from med-school and any children they had.Everything had changed after her diagnosis. Her third birthday, Faith had stayed cooped up in the house as she was quickly growing accustomed to doing every day. Claire couldn‚Äôt even blame Frank for it; it had ultimately been her decision to not throw a party for the next two years. Claire had been terrified of setting her off, of causing her daughter terror and grief on her own birthday. They‚Äôd watched movies and sang together all day, snacking on Faith‚Äôs favorite things.Frank hadn‚Äôt come home for cake that year, or the following one.Claire vowed, after depriving her daughter for years, after allowing herself to be plagued by fear and doubt rather than trying to work with her, that her fifth birthday would be the best one she‚Äôd ever had.At seven o‚Äôclock on the twelfth of May, Claire‚Äôs alarm went off, and she was smiling before she even opened her eyes.She had a daughter that was five years old. It was inconceivable.¬† Keep reading

                                            Lover Chapter 6 -¬†‚ÄúMiss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince‚Äù
                                                Read on AO3Chapter 1 // Chapter 2 // Chapter 3 // Chapter 4¬†// Chapter 5
Summary:It‚Äôs been a month since Jamie and Claire‚Äôs emotional parting. What happens when they run into each other, at a high school football game of all places?Notes:Thanks so much for reading and commenting! I know the last chapter was painful. Angst just makes everything else so much sweeter, right? We left our lovers in a pretty dark place, and a month later their emotional states are not much improved (I wonder why?). This is my favorite chapter I‚Äôve written so far, I hope you like it!The late September air kissed Claire‚Äôs cheeks bringing a lively flush to her face as she wrapped her blue and yellow fleece blanket tighter around her shoulders. It was Friday night and the homecoming game was in full swing. She had chosen a spot in the upper corner of the bleachers where the crowd was thinner.¬† Being the school nurse, Claire was a member of the school faculty, and expected to be present for at least one of the weekend‚Äôs festivities.¬† It was much better to be a little cold at the game then chaperoning the dance the following evening.¬† No thank you, she did not need to see her beloved students grinding against each other like animals.¬†Claire would never forget the first time she chaperoned a school dance and saw Mary Hawkins attached at the mouth to some gangly, acne-ridden boy on the dance floor. Sweet, innocent Mary Hawkins, a stammering girl who visited her office at least twice a week for her inhaler when an anxiety attack caused her asthma to flare up.¬† Who knew she could hold her breath for that long? Claire had just stood there on the sidelines, revolted but unable to look away.¬† Eventually, Jo noticed and stepped in ‚ÄúNo PDA at School functions!! Don‚Äôt make me call your parents, Alex‚Äù The mortified couple simultaneously turned a shade of red Claire wasn‚Äôt sure she‚Äôd ever seen before and separated as if they were spring-loaded. ‚ÄúBoys will be boys then, but where are the wise men?‚Äù was Jo‚Äôs aside as they returned to Claire‚Äôs side.¬†Claire wished Jo was here now, but unfortunately they had a weekly D&amp;D commitment on Friday nights that simply could not be missed.¬† She didn‚Äôt really wish Jo was there, she wished somebody was there.¬† Someone that could warm not only her chilled body, but her chilled heart. She tried to conjure up Frank in her mind, his arm around her, explaining the nuances of the game, but she had to admit to herself that Frank wasn‚Äôt the one who could warm her to the core. That‚Äôs what got her into this mess in the first place though. You play stupid games you win stupid prizes, she thought to herself. She tried to shake the thoughts from her head and focus on the game, hoping the cold would numb her heart the way it numbed her nose. It would be easier if she understood American football, her very-English-indeed father had never enjoyed the sport the way her friends‚Äô fathers did growing up, and Uncle Lamb had certainly never taken an interest in it. All she really knew is that the Wildcats were losing and the crowd around her was starting to look dejected. As she scanned their faces her eyes caught on russet curls in the bleachers below her, several rows down in the center was Jamie. Even from the back he was unmistakably recognizable, his large frame filling out the sherpa lined jacket he was wearing, effortlessly unbuttoned despite the chill in the air. He seemed to be with a woman and a group of children and young teens, at least two of the smaller ones were running up and down the bleachers. Probably his sister, she assured herself‚Äîshe hadn‚Äôt met Jenny but she knew she had several children.She counted days, she counted miles but now to see him there brought everything she had been trying to forget back in a rush. Her face felt even more flushed than before and something deep in her heart stirred awake.¬† She stared at him voyeuristically‚Äìsimultaneously willing him to turn around to catch her eye and hoping he wouldn‚Äôt see her. Surrounded by canoodling teenagers she thought to herself, you know I adore you; I‚Äôm crazier for you than I was at sixteen for anybody.¬† It was like she was lost in a film scene, waving homecoming queens, the marching band playing and those Friday night lights.¬† Halftime had started and she hadn‚Äôt even noticed until Jamie arose from his seat and started heading up the bleacher steps.¬† She tried to watch him from the corner of her eye.¬† He looked exactly the same, yet different somehow, like the spark was missing from him. We‚Äôre so sad we paint the town blue she mused to herself.¬† She knew she had hurt him, but it was better to do so in the short run than string him along.¬† As a nurse, she knew the benefits of ripping a bandage off quickly.¬† She averted her eyes down as he passed; the stairs were far enough from where she was sitting that she hoped he wouldn‚Äôt notice, and he didn‚Äôt seem to as he continued up to the concession stand.¬† She released a breath she didn‚Äôt realize she was holding and was left with her head hung as she tried to come up with an escape plan.¬†Keep reading
