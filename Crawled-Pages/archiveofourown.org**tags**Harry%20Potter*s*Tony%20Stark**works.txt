    Summary
      Davis era un hombre bastante ordinario, sin nombre y sin rostro a los ojos de su jefe, el Director Fury, y a los ojos de casi todos sus colegas. Había disfrutado mucho este anonimato, a pesar de una infancia inusual. Sin embargo, el destino juega con él cuando Coulson muere y es nombrado temporalmente en su lugar porque es el unico agente disponible.

    Summary
      In a time of myth and legend, when all of the world was new and history was nothing more than a dream. Three gods of fantastic power came together, drawn by a prophecy spoke by one. Speaking of a time of great destruction, and false leadership. Of fear, and warmongering. Of a time of magic dying, held in the stranglehold of those claiming themselves to be lords of dark or light magic. The gods knew this could not come to pass, so they concocted a plan. In a great sacrifice, they cast away their immortal forms, joining together they placed their powers, knowledge, memories, and their spirits in the form of a once mortal girl. She was their champion, and she was them. She was the blade of the gods, and she was the wielder. She was a god, and she was a goddess. She would bring down the false lords, resort Egypt to its rightful place, and bring magic into its golden age. But she would not do all this alone, she would have the help of a powerful Asian Emporer, the first of the fallen, her potion prodigy brother, and a child.A child who bore a very distinctive lightning scar on the crown of his head.

But I promise it's not all dark BAMF Harry Potter Other Additional Tags to Be Added I'm not as organized with my tagging on this fic as I usually am I usually make a note of the tags as I write And edit them in with each chapter that I post But I have already written almost 7 chapters And am only now starting to think about the tags whoops Blood Drinking Non-Consensual Blood Drinking blood drinking during sex I can't believe "blood drinking during sex" isn't a recognized tag also can't believe I forgot to tag blood drinking in a vampire fic Bucky Barnes's Trigger Words Alternate Universe - Voldemort Wins Multiverse
    Summary
      Harry's just trying to make his way in this new world, but he just can't seem to stop getting used by the bad guys.*	*	*	“I knew him,” the Asset pleads, pushing as much emotion as his barren personality can muster into the words.Their master ignores him, “Wipe him, start over,” he says instead.Harry, to the side, looks on with cold, dispassionate eyes.  It’s frustrating to require your battle partner to relearn how to fight at your side time and time again.It is even more frustrating to be the pet of someone so obviously beneath you.

    Summary
      April 28th, 2015. The Avengers work together again, going to the small country of Sokovia to retrieve the scepter from HYDRA, kicking off the events of Age of Ultron. A prisoner uses their arrival as a distraction and escapes, wreaking havoc. It turns out the prisoner is Harry Potter, wizard extraordinaire and Tony Stark's fiance, missing for almost five years.
Of course Tony's not going to leave him there, and Steve Rogers can stuff his concerns.
Planning to take this through Infinity War and a much-changed Endgame, unless I end things with Infinity War.

    Summary
      When Harry Potter took on the title Master of the death he was not sure what he expected but it was definitely not this. When Harry Potter dies he is reborn as one of Tony Stark’s AI’s. However, Coding and human memories are not meant to mix. An IA feeling emotions for both his maker and his AI Companion, Jarvis. Leads to some very interesting Scenarios. Add Tony building bodies for the both of them and you get worried Avengers, Loki who keeps getting pranked by an AI, and a Nick Fury who wonders if someone should kill or commend Tony for his stupidity and genius.

    Summary
      'Together' the Captain said. And abandoned him.Stark men are made of iron. I am iron man.He will die alone in a bunker. Abandoned by a man he once considered friend. It doesn't take a genius to know this.Or maybe it does. Maybe that's why he hoped.Lying in a metal suit, with a bruised body, and a broken friendship. He hoped to get back up again.
