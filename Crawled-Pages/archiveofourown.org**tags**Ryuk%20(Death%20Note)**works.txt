    Summary
      It's a world where your blood changes most everything. We are told that the lighter your blood the purer you are, the good. But as human nature foretells, we sin, and most live life with their blood forever muddied. The worst of the worse- the despicable, bleed the darkest black. This is the fact that L will use to his advantage, the winning factor that must prove that Light Yagami is indeed Kira. It has to. But things don't exactly go as planned, and fate has much in store for the pair than simply being rivals.

    Summary
      A canon-divergence AU beginning at the point where Misa is taken into custody as the second Kira and forfeits her Death Note. Light wants to turn himself in, but Rem has decided that Light, and the Death Note, are too dangerous for Misa. Rem forces Light to cut ties with her, hoping she can have a normal life again.
Light breaks up with Misa and continues operating as Kira, leaving Misa alone in L's custody. L, suspecting that Misa might be more powerful than she appears, decides to try to take advantage of Light’s abandonment and befriend Misa, hoping that if he earns her trust, she might turn on Light and help L bring Kira down.

    Summary
      Summary: On a trip to Japan, a girl from our world ends up in the world of Death Note. This is an attempt at a realistic OC from our world and a take on the events that would transpire if L had more information in the war against Kira instead of taking shots in the dark. Eventual L x OC

    Summary
      The unimaginable had happened. L knew Kira was going to die—it was something he was fully aware of. But for Light to die of a heart attack, potentially at the hand of Kira but also maybe because of stress and an adrenaline spike during the mock execution, L finds himself needing to solve the Kira case without the first person he would consider an equal, his first friend, who may have been something more if things were different.But it turns out Light is now a ghost who is unable to move on until the real Kira is brought to justice. Being the only one who can see Light, and knowing that the moment Kira is caught, he will lose Light forever, L finds himself torn when faced with a difficult choice. Either he helps bring Light enough peace of mind to move on, or he can selfishly keep Light with him forever and try to make things right even if he knows Light would be miserable due to his unjust death and the price for staying in the living realm.Fanfiction of Ultimate Irony: Light dying of a heart attack unrelated to the Death Note.

    Summary
      Midoriya Izuku used to worship heroes. He wanted to be one, but he didn't have a quirk. This is how the normal anime goes, right?But what if his mother was an administrator at a hero agency, and what if he actually put in work to be a hero beforehand thanks to a radio interview? What if he took off the rose-tinted glasses he somehow has? And, more importantly, what if he has a Death Note?or:Midoriya Izuku loses his hero worship, but gains a Death Note.P.S: You don't need to read/watch either Death Note to read this. Obviously watch/read it, it's good and it's more context, but you can still enjoy it :)
