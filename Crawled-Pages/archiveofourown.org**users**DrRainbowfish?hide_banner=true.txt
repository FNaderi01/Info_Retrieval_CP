      Nathan finds an injured cat in an alley in the middle of a winter storm. He takes it to a nearby animal shelter, where Simon works. Nathan discovers more than just a blossoming friendship, like the lengths he would go to save a strange cat, and like how the cat he rescued isn't really a cat.

    Summary
      Title's from the Iron and Wine song used in the show. 
Soulmates AU - in this case, you're born with a tattoo of the first words your soulmate says to you. Used a bit of artistic licence – technically Nathan's would be 'I’m not a pantysniffer', but that’s too cruel to be tattooed on someone, even Nathan; plus I feel like even he might guess. Maybe.  
It's a WIP, I'm guessing it'll be about ten chapters in full.

    Summary
      “Are you all right?” Simon mutters, reaching up and hesitantly brushing his fingers against Nathan’s shoulder where it rests on his chest.“All right?!” Nathan sits up suddenly, eyes wide. “I’m brilliant! You saved my life, Barry!” He grins ear to ear, and Simon exhales nervously with a small smile as Nathan laughs almost hysterically.
