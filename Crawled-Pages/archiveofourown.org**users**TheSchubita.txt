    Summary
      “You’re so ripe, Roger,” he presses another kiss to his forehead, this one lingering, and Roger feels himself float again, only not arching into the fleeting touch because he’s still fucking paralyzed. “So ripe for me,” John repeats. “Let’s go home.”Roger doesn’t know anything beyond that, darkness swallowing him.He dreams of the sea..Prompts from the Must Fuck Weekend: (Tentacle) Monster / Aphrodisiacs / "I am (insert God/Goddess of Desire/Lust).

    Summary
      "Brian, if I don't get to fuck you in one way or another real soon, I'm committing murder," John rushed out."I – I figured," Brian said slowly. "Your suggestion?"John picked at a loose thread of their pillow. "Alright, just – don't hate me," he said quietly."John –" Brian began."IthinkRogershouldjoinusinbed," John said in one breath, looking anywhere but at Brian.Brian sat up. "Come again?"  "I think Roger –""No, I heard you, I just – what in the hell? Roger?".Or, the one where John and Brian have some serious communication issues, Roger is trying to be a good friend, Freddie Knows Everything but Would Prefer Not To, and the whole "Friends with Benefits" thing has never worked out for anyone, ever.
