    Summary
      An emotionally stunted fuckwit struggles to adult and emerges from his chrysalis as a beautiful butterfly (sort of) Part II. 
  Marriage wasn’t exactly what he thought it would be like. They weren’t like married couples on the telly or in films or like his parents, who’d yelled and screamed and thrown things a lot, or like the neighbors next door growing up, who drank wine and went ballroom dancing on Friday nights. Barry felt less like his husband and more like a partner in crime, which technically he sort of was, and had been for awhile. But now it was just the two of them, heading out into the great unknown, and when he thought about all those nights he’d spent alone, sleeping on that hard mat in the community centre, he was so fucking grateful and relieved that this was how it had turned out.
