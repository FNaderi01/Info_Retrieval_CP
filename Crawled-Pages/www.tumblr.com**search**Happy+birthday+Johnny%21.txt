10JOHN: I’m not a tough guy. I’ve always had to have a facade of being tough to protect myself from other people’s neuroses. But really, I’m a very sensitive and weak guy. 
PAUL: John and I were two of the luckiest people in the twentieth century to have found each other. The partnership, the mix, was incredible. We both had submerged qualities that we each saw and knew. I had to be the bastard as well as the nice melodic one and John had to have a warm and loving side for me to stand him all those years. John and I would never have stood each other for that length of time had we been just one-dimensional. (1997)
GEORGE: John Lennon is a saint, and he’s heavy-duty, and he’s great, and I love him. But at the same time, he’s such a bastard. (1974)
RINGO: I was a big fan of John’s. I always felt he had the biggest heart, and he wasn’t the cynic that people thought. He had the biggest heart and he was the fastest. He was in and out. While we were still getting in he was out and on to the next round. (1995)
