      Elros respects his cousin and fellow monarch far too much to ever cross him.Or at least not without a small shred of plausible deniability.

  Summary
    Title from Mark Twain:"But who prays for Satan? Who in eighteen centuries has had the common humanity to pray for the one sinner that needed it most. . . for the plain and unassailable reason that his was the first and greatest need, he being among sinners the supremest?"***Annatar decides to trust Celebrimbor, changing the course of the second age.

    Summary
      "Let his bones never break! And however they try to destroy him, let him never die! "Tears raced down Izuku's cheeks. His sight became so blurred he could barely read the spellbook in front of him and he thought of Shinsou Hitoshi-- brilliant, sleepy-eyed Hitoshi who fed stray alley cats in the evening and bought pastries for Izuku's mother whenever he visited and wanted to save people so they never had to hurt the same way he did and whose smile could outshine each and every blessed constellation in the sky when he truly meant it. Hitoshi, who could be anywhere right now with blood trailing down his face, legs and lungs burning exhaustedly as he tried to outrun a hateful, slur-spitting mob that wanted nothing more than to rend his flesh from his aching bones for circumstances he had no control over. Hitoshi, all alone and confused and in pain. Izuku poured all his heart and will into the spell.
  "Let him never die!"
(Lads, I wrote this in a fevered haze at 2 AM after listening to Wicked for the first time. I don't know what I'm doing and I never will.)

    No Archive Warnings ApplyHermione Granger/Ron Weasley Nico di Angelo/Will SolaceHarry Potter Hermione Granger Ron Weasley Nico di Angelo Pansy Parkinson Draco Malfoy Will Solace Daphne Greengrass Millicent Bulstrode Tracey Davisa few oc's since there aren't many Slytherins and some to get Nico to hogwarts but they are all awesome aka story to redeem slytherin and all slytherins like man they deserved to have character arcs and the story were there is one death after Cedric's can't take all those feels so this is also a story where we won't have that fewer deaths of fictional characters 2017 Slow Build slow as heck
    Summary
      The Golden Trio had just gone through Cedric Diggory's death and survived the Triwizard Tournament, so when the school year begins again, they only expect the same old jeers from Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson. However, when they come back they are surprised to learn that others have prepared for the rise of Voldemort... or to cover up his return. Nico's father, Hades, decided that he can't let Voldemort cheat death, especially when the Dark Lord is a loser. So, Nico is sent to protect Harry and quicken up the pace to defeat Voldemort. Joining him are two new demigods to help him understand the wizarding world as they return to their roots.However, things become a bit harder for Nico to complete his mission once he gets sorted into Slytherin...This takes place after the war with Gaea and Triwizard Tournament, no there is no concept of time, and yes, the Slytherins do get their rightful place as real people, as wells as Hufflepuffs, and everyone else. Also, this was written to avoid as many fictional character deaths as possible since this focuses on how Harry and the other houses are dealing with Cedric's death :).Some chapters are long and some are hella short.
