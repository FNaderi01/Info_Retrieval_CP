Performance Driven Training and Mentoring
Becht Performance Group provides training materials and courses focused on real-life, day-to-day scenarios and the application of industry best practices. Rather than relying on typical PowerPoint-focused lectures during which trainees are rarely engaged and frequently lose information before they even leave the classroom, our trainings employ a workshop style, and incorporate scenario-based exercises. This methodology has been proven to maximize retention and synthesis of information by incorporating multimodal learning techniques and engaging trainees. Our training materials encourage trainees to synthesize new information and best practices into their daily tasks, bridging the gap between learning and practice. It is our goal to help our clients harness the skills, knowledge, and expertise of their current workforce in order to develop training to benefit the next generation. Let us help ensure that your workforce is safe, efficient, and prepared for anything.
