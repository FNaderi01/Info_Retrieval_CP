Two steadfast enemies spend the summer teaching each other that it's okay to feel, and that they aren't as steadfast as they thought.

    Summary
      Hermione returns to Hogwarts for her 'eighth' year without Harry and Ron, with the horrors of the war still fresh in her mind, but determined to start anew. Malfoy seems subdued, altered by the events of the past year or so, though he's not without his acerbic tongue. Assigned Theodore Nott as her patrol partner for their prefect duties, she finally has the time to get to know the two Slytherins, and discovers that there's a whole lot more to them than the prejudice of their past and the snake on their house badge. Slow-burn Draco x Theo x Hermione, endgame happy trio with lots of fluff and smut.
