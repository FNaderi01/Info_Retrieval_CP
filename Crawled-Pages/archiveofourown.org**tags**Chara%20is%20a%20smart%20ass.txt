    Summary
      With each death the darkness grows, consuming and twisting a lost soul that is torn from betrayal.Why does this seem so familiar? These dreams feel so real...Are they dreams or perhaps they are memories of another life? Another timeline?Two voices call out to the lost soul... One offers help, all they want is to be friends.The other, a weaken whisper that longs to be heard. Everyone lies, betrayal runs deep.Who to trust when both voices lie? Another soul tired but refuses to give up, for he knows what will happen if he does."i wasn't ready for this responsibility... but darling... you didn't give me much a choice..."He says as he raises his bony hand, a faint purple aura around it.
