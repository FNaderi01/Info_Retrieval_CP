    Summary
      Aizawa has his class run a mock villain test. There would be a 2v8 battle style. There would be 2 villains and 8 heroes. Pretty unbalanced for the villains. But, when you have Problem Child 1 and Problem Child 2 work together, it is worse than when they are at one another’s throats. Or (List)- Bakugo is fucking ecstatic for Midoriya being violent- People are shook as their precious class green fluff bunny kicks ass- Aizawa needs coffee- Nezu maniacally laughs from his many cameras watching the whole ordeal(cuz we all know he’s everywhere)Or (Short Summary)That one fan fiction where Class 1-A want Bakugo and Midoriya to work together only to get their asses handed to them by the Problem Children.I got inspiration from Hero Class Civil Warfare by RogueDruid (Icarius51), because Izuku was a badass villain and super smart. I just want more of our cute little green fluff showing everybody who’s boss!

Meanwhile, Cersei marries Euron Greyjoy for the sake of her unborn child. Cersei's prophecy will all come true, some of it in the most unexpected of ways.  She further gets another, more hopeful prophecy, indicating she will have more children and that Jaime may return to her.Excerpt:"So, is there anything you can tell me about these children I am supposed to have?""You would not believe me if I told you.""Tell me anyway. Whatever it is," replied Cersei in frustration."One born in your darkest time, one not of your blood, and two whom aren't what they appear to be. Not all from your loins.""Well, that's simply not possible. I'm not gonna play mother to some orphans or whatever foul thing you're suggesting," replied Cersei dismissively as she rolled her eyes.   Now Updating regularly

    Summary
      Canon Divergence starting from Season 2 Episode/Chapter 261 of Webtoon SPOILERS if you're not caught up to this chapter!! -----------After a difficult conversation with a certain Princess of Jahad, Bam comes to realize that perhaps in the better interest of both himself and the team, Rachel should not accompany them to the Hidden Floor. The decision has some immediate effects in their lives, forcing them to face inner struggles, past trauma, and uncertainties about the future. But above all, this simple change causes a massive upheaval in destiny, including a shift in team dynamics, new feelings coming to light, and an entirely different future to come. After all, just as one wave can cause a storm that will devour the Tower whole, so can one simple change interrupt the destructive fate to come. But, unfortunately, this fate may not be more merciful.

    Summary
      First in a series of encounters.  Sort of canon but freely interpreted.  This one is set after the events of the final episode.  Struggling with tags so here goes:  Jiang Cheng and Wei Wuxian as brothers; Wei Wuxian and Lan Zhan as romantic partners (hence the mature rating).  Nothing explicit.  Got stuck in MDZS / The Untamed, never to leave :-)

    Summary
      In his first life, Shen Qingqiu had died with grievances. Everything that he had done, every single misunderstanding or wrong move that he made all cumulated into his death.
Then, of course, he woke up with a system. In his second life, he was a dancer. In the third, the young master of a rich family... Countless years passed, countless lives met and lived.
Now, he was tired. He just wanted everything to end. But before he could do that, he would have to take care of his biggest regrets. Regrets that he originally thought he had let go of, only to realize later on that he could never let go of no matter how hard he tried. 
From his first life.
Now, he was back in his own body, facing a familiar nemesis...

    Graphic Depictions Of Violence Major Character DeathMidoriya Izuku Aizawa Shouta | Eraserhead Bakugou Katsuki Class 1-A (My Hero Academia)Vigilante Midoriya Izuku Midoriya Izuku Has a Quirk Midoriya Izuku Needs A Hug most people need a hug after seeing their own corpse multiple times gee i wonder whose fault it is that he's traumatized certainly not mine haha Regretful Bakugou Katsuki Midoriya Izuku is a Cryptid he just likes freaking people out and being strange Dead Midoriya Izuku but not really? he revives Midoriya Izuku is a Gamer ha that'll be more funny once you read the story let Izuku say fuck no beta we die like men Parental Aizawa Shouta | Eraserhead I'm really bad at writing fight scenes Touch-Starved Midoriya Izuku the tags are a mess I regret not writing buffer chapters now I'm stressed Mineta Minoru Exists sorry about that OOC characters [!] chapter 8 is an OOC update Suicidal Thoughts Suicide his preferred method of escape is jumping off buildings so that might be triggering
    Summary
      Midoriya Izuku is fourteen years old. He lives with his mother, Midoriya Inko. He loves katsudon and All Might and analyzing Hero fights. Everybody said that he was Quirkless, so he listened. Quirkless people don't look at something and have a screen appear with flavour text. Quirkless people don't touch something and instantly know how to use it best as a weapon. Quirkless people don't get EXP from washing dishes. And Quirkless people most definitely do NOT respawn when they die. Midoriya Izuku has decided that maybe he isn't as Quirkless as he thought he was.———This is kind of a beta test for a story idea!! Currently rewriting this into a completely different direction, which I'll start posting chapters of either when I get a lot of buffer, or when I finish and know I don't want to change anything. Hope you enjoy the beta version, though!

    Summary
      Constellations and Dragons. They were both something filled with magic that one needed to take time in order to understand. I guess they went pretty well together in that sense. These are Nalu one-shots that I wrote for things like Nalu week and just to write. I hope you enjoy!
