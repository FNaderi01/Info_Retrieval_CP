        Ah, hey, good to hear from you! Glad you liked the chapter, I'm trying to keep them short and simple, and yet still have that cosy comfort level.Yeah, that's a reference to a character specific plot point that both of them know about, and anyone who has watched season 2 and 3 would know. But it's also a major spoiler and I didn't want that. However...it also helped them off the couch and into the bed :PI've never done all three LOTR movies (extended) all in one go, although I can see myself binging on it once since the trilogy is so damn good. Unfortunately I've noticed that I start falling asleep while watching TV or films now, something I wasn't doing even a year ago, ugh! At least Clay and Justin had some comfortable arms to rest in ;)Err, the less said about this week the better...I have a training exercise to oversee and lead next week, but it's local so I'll still be on post. That's good both for me and my writing! Final chapter for this tomorrow, but I wouldn't be put out to maybe update it in the future; I feel like they're a really good match for fluff and cuddles! TMW is about 40% done on its next chapter, want to hit my monthly target on that, and Eternity is getting a smutty (spoiler free) spin off that, all things going well, should be out in time for someone's nuptials...In any case, I hope you're enjoying your weekend and are looking forward to next week; it being Samhain and all!

        That's a really great idea about keeping the chapters short and simple and infused with that cozy, comfort vibe! Actually reading this series has made me really want to get back into one of my fluff series.That's awesome that you were able to get the best of both worlds in a sense -- the character/plot reference without the spoilers, AND a solid excuse for them to cuddle up in bed!Ohh, sorry to hear you've been getting the TV/movie sleepies! My boyfriend is like that too. He'll just fall asleep right in the middle of something. LOL, makes it tough for the shows we try to watch together since even though I'm super not trying to "cheat" and watch ahead...I still end up ahead just by virtue of staying awake :POh boy! You got me a smutty, spoiler-free Eternity spin off as a wedding present?! Dawww, you shouldn't have! Haha, but I'm certainly glad you did! (LOL, I know it's not really for me, but that's certainly an awesome treat to look forward to! :D)Darn, I was hoping this past week had been a more pleasant one for you. Hopefully things ease up soon. I think I just followed the news a lot less this past week, but it didn't seem like there were quite as many distressing headlines. At least your training exercise next week is local and won't interfere with your writing schedule! Good luck with it and have a great rest of the weekend!

        Thanks, it's what I've been trying to do with Eternity in the current arc, although for different reasons. But I like being able to do short chapter and feeling like I've achieved something since I rarely get the chance to do long writing sessions like I used to. I thought I'd get the next chapter for this done today, but I spent it on TMW so good and bad. At least I have a solid idea of how to start that chapter. I was thinking too that I'd "complete" this story with the third chapter, but may update it in the future as the need or desire for fluff came up. I think too that smut for "Clustin" will have to go in a separate story. Oooh, I wonder which fluff series that is? If I had to guess I'd say it was the Scott/Isaac one that takes place in Scott's bedroom, right? Or is that complete? lol, sorry XDIt's also pretty helpful too though; there a Youtuber I can watch/listen to and in about five minutes I'm asleep, lol. So, good for those days when you need to sleep, haha. I can see how that would be awkward though when you're watching a series or something. At least I can just rewatch it over again, even if that sometimes means watching it a few times, lol.Yeah...not really a wholesome wedding gift is it, lol?! Ah, the fates aligned on this one. I was thinking about something wedding themed actually, but I couldn't remember which two characters you liked the most, plus I'm not really a good wedding writing; lots of my characters have been having relationship problems or breakups lately, so not a good thing to get into the mood for that type of fic. But the recent Eternity chapters will enable the smutt-off to work. Like all before, it's an alternative to an existing chapter, but not story compliant. In any case, it'll be spoiler free so you can read it whenever it takes your fancy. Assuming that it'll be well after next week since you have to consummate that marriage to make it legit ;PFollowing the news is always dangerous to your health! But anyway, I hope you're charged up for the week and what's to come!
