as admirable as karamo‚Äôs strategy of¬†‚Äústart the emotional conversation in a moving vehicle so they can‚Äôt run away‚Äù is, and as well as its worked thus far, he is going to lose somebody eventually. one of these days, the fab five will encounter a straight man who would literally rather jump out of a car that‚Äôs going 60 miles an hour than talk about his feelings, and that will be a very interesting episode.

Critics saying Queer Eye needs to keep things fresh to not get predictable. But I need 174721694 episodes of people being kind to each other and people lifting each other up. The world needs kindness. There‚Äôs nothing boring or formulaic about that.
