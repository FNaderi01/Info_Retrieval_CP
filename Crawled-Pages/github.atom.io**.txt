      GitHub for Atom
        The GitHub package brings Git and GitHub integration right inside your editor! Now you can switch or create branches, stage changes, commit, pull and push, resolve merge conflicts, view and checkout pull requests and more.
        Visit the ðŸš€ documentation to learn how to use all the features.
      Install
      The GitHub package comes already bundled with Atom, so there is nothing extra to install.Â ðŸŽ‰
