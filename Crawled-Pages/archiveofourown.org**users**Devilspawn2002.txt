    Summary
      Injured and in the hospital, Izuku gets visited by one friend who wants to be closer and one close friend who is afraid to lose ground to another. Longing and jealousy play equal parts in the lives of those around Izuku and he, mildly drifting through it all on painkillers and an over observant brain that just wont shut up, endures it all with a smile.

    Summary
      Concerning the rating: Okay, guys. Before you make any assumptions of this fic, let me clarify that the M rating is only there to be safe and mainly for the Graphic Depictions Of Violence tag.Edit: Changed it back to T because I realised that canon can be just as "bad" with violence at times and since it still counts as shonen...Also, make sure to LOOK AT THE TAGS properly.------"If heroes save us, who saves the heroes?"Midoriya Izuku's quirk lets him see and interpret the behaviour of particles. Because of that, Izuku always sees past the facade of the heroes, sees what the heroes sacrifice for the safety of the public and his dream shifts. He still wants to be a hero, but not the kind that fights at the front. He wants to be a hero for his beloved heroes. He decides to become a doctor. Nobody expects him to become a doctor who makes miracles possible.(I wanna save Toshi, alright?!)(To those who read Q:AM: Don't ask me what I have with particles. I don't know myself.)

    Summary
      Some of the other teachers thought Aizawa was a bit overzealous in writing such a long list of rules for his class. They were wrong. He had very good reasons for each and every one of them.
