    Summary
      He wakes up to his life lying face down in fine, waterlogged sand knowing too much yet nothing at all. The diamond-shaped implant lodged his wrist, an aching, foreign body surrounded by raw tissue, labels him CT-7567. He knows this number represents him. He does not know how he knows this. OR: The sexy dinosaur-riding wilderness survival fic you didn't know you needed. Star Wars / Ark: Survival Evolved crossover. No knowledge of Ark required.
