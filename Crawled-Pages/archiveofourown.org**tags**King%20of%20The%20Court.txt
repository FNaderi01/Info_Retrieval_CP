    Summary
      (OC x OIKAWA)“I’m resigning from the Volleyball Club.” Yana Iwaizumi used to love playing volleyball, but not anymore. She joined a team  as soon as she was old enough to play competitively. Unfortunately, for better or for worse they were always in the top three strongest schools.After a sudden school transfer to Aoba Johsai she vowed to never have anything to do with the Volleyball Club or it's incredibly popular captain and main setter, Oikawa. That's a little hard to do, especially when your cousin is the vice captain of the team and Oikawa's best friend.
