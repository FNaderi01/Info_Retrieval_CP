                            The Education Exchange: Making Exam Schools More Diverse in Boston
                                By Education Next

            In Boston, nearly 25% of public middle and high school students attend exam schools, but these schools are much less diverse than the school district as a whole.
A new study looks closely at the entrance exam used to select students for these schools and at ways the admissions process could be changed to to make the schools more diverse without sacrificing academic selectivity.
Joshua Goodman of the Harvard Kennedy School joins Paul E. Peterson to discuss the new study, “Increasing Diversity in Boston’s Exam Schools,” which he co-wrote with Melanie Rucinski.
