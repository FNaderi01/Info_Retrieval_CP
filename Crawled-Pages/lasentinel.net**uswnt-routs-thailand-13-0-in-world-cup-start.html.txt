USWNT Routs Thailand 13-0 in World Cup Start            
				By Alan Braxton, Staff Writer                
	                	                Published June 13, 2019

The last time Thailand and the US women met up, it was a 9-0 thrashing in favor of the United States. It was not much different on this occasion. The score was 3-0 by halftime with the ball staying in Thailand’s final third nearly the entire time.
The US showed no mercy to Thailand. They would go on to score another 10 goals in the second half breaking a record for goals. Alex Morgan scored a record six goals and looks to be in excellent form at the moment.
It has been five years since we last witnessed a senior US side play at a World Cup finals. The US men’s side failed to make the 2018 World Cup in Russia last year after a shock defeat to Trinidad &amp; Tobago, marking the first time in decades a World Cup would be played without the United States present in the tournament.

Champions four years ago at the Women’s World Cup in Canada, the pressure is mounting as they prepare to make another statement this World Cup. Winning a World Cup back-to-back is very rare and has only been done by one team (Germany in 2003 and 2007) since the tournament’s inception in 1991. Winning back-to-back World Cups as a coach, nearly impossible as it has yet to be done. That will be US coach Jill Ellis’ prerogative however as she attempts to achieve the feat.
        ADVERTISEMENT        
The US is easily one of the favorites in the tournament, along with Sweden, Germany, and tournament hosts France. The game against Thailand, for all intents and purposes must be taken with a grain of salt. The United States tournament only gets harder from here on out and there are plenty of strong sides in this tournament willing to give the US a run for their money.
They play a much more organized Chile on Sunday 6/16.
