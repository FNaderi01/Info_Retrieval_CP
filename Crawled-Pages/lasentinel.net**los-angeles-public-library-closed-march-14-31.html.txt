				By City News Service

		The Los Angeles Public Library’s Central Library and 72 branch libraries are closed March 14 through 31. The action is being taken in accordance with city guidelines to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus, and to protect staff and patrons including the most vulnerable Angelenos.
During this time, due dates for borrowed materials will be automatically extended, no late fines will be assessed, and patrons can return materials when libraries reopen.
Librarians will continue providing assistance through telephone reference (213) 228-7272; the web-based service, Ask A Librarian available at www.lapl.org/ask-a-librarian; and Book A Librarian at book-librarian.

Szabo. “During this time we encourage people to access our librarians by telephone or online, and use our extensive digital resources through lapl.org.”
