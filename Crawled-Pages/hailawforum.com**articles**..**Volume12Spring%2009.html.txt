THAI TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATIONS IN THAILAND
PIYABUTR BUNARAMRUEANG
The article, presented at the 2007 ALIN International  Academic Conference at Chulalongkorn University, analyzes the regulation of the  telecommunications industry in Thailand.  The article contrasts the evolution of telecommunications regulation in the US and the EU with regulation in Thailand.  The article argues that asymmetric regulations (regulations applicable to  powerful incumbent competitors rather than applicable generally) are not  necessary for the Thai telecommunications industry in order for that industry  to achieve a high level of competition on a level playing field and argues  further for a “light-handed approach” by the National Telecommunication  Commission.
