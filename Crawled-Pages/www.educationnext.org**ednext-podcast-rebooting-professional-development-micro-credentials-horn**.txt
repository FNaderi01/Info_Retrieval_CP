EdNext Podcast · Ep. 75 – March 8, 2017: Rebooting Professional Development
			Can professional development for teachers be personalized?
Michael Horn joins EdNext editor-in-chief Marty West to discuss a new way of doing professional development. Teachers identify the skills they want to acquire, receive specialized training, and are certified as having these new competencies, receiving a micro-credential, something akin to a merit badge.
For more, read “Competency-Based Learning for Teachers,” by Michael Horn and Thomas Arnett, in the new issue of Education Next.
The EdNext Podcast is available on iTunes, Google Play, Soundcloud, Stitcher and here every Wednesday.
