Tony, looking into a mirror at the Sanctum: Hey, Strange. I think your mirror is broken.Stephen, from across the room: [annoyed] Mirrors don’t have filters, Stark.Tony: I’m serious! There’s something wrong with it!Stephen: Fine. What is it?Tony, leaning closer to examine his reflection: I’m the only one standing here, yet it keeps showing me other people!Tony: First, it was my parents. I thought maybe I was hallucinating or something. But now it’s showing me the boys and you! I really just want to fix my damn hair!Stephen, slowly closing his book: Oh. Right. Um, it’s a trick mirror. Use the one in my bathroom. [Tony grumbles and leaves the room]Wong, who knows exactly what the mirror’s power really is: So…trick mirror? Interesting. Stephen, who knows what the mirror is showing people: Shut UP, Wong.
