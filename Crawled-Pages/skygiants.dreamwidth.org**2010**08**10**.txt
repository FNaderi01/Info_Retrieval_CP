For pretty much every request on the Fannish Top Fives, you can take it as a given that my reaction falls affectionately somewhere on the spectrum between "you know well how to play to the judge" and "YOU ARE ALL WEIRDOS."  *laughing*Okay, Top Fives #1, from nevacaruso: top five crossover characters you'd like to see Akio seduce, and why.  (So basically, after going quite happily for several years without posting at all about Akio's seduction habits, this journal has apparently become ALL AKIO SEDUCTION, ALL THE TIME.  I am sorry!  I promise after this no more posts about Akio sexin' for a very long time.)I limited myself for this to canons which I had not already written up in this dream crossover list, because redundancy!  Which did help me narrow it down a little.( Images are occasionally shirtless but as worksafe as anything involving Akio! ). . . . so yeah, I'm done.  But feel free to contribute your own top lolarious Akio seduction!
