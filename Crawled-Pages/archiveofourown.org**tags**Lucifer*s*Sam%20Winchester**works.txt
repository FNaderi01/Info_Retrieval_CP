    Summary
      “You knew he’d ask for it. Didn’t you? And you didn’t stop to intervene. If you had looked at him only once while we were talking, I’m sure he’d have been placated.” Death said. “And yet, you’ve chosen to show me perhaps one of the most intimate things you can experience here.”He crouched down to look at Sam, ran two fingers over the swell of his back, “Why, Lucifer?”“Part of me wants you to understand. Part of me thinks you might.”Or,Death has a midlife crisis in the cage, Lucifer is given a chance he may not have deserved, Sam’s hallucinations reveal secrets that should have stayed buried, and Heaven and Hell and everything in between are caught up in the throes of the worst family drama in the history of history and it’s all downhill from there. A canon-divergent based loosely on events from Pathological, attempts to explore the intricacies of morality to a powerful timeless entity, as well as love, loss, family. Archangels and their all-so-human strife, and their not-so-human perspective. (Lots of angst, and torture, and moral gray areas. No redemption arcs but the bad guys might need a hug too.)

    Summary
      “Just… Don’t be so blatant about anyone’s proclivities again, will you? Unless they’re your own.”
Everyone present, including the stripper, considered it a cute joke. A playful deviancy, because that’s what Alphas are in some circles. A dirty joke. A whispered desire. Something to indulge in but avoid in real life, unless under pain-stakingly controlled circumstances.
“So serious,” Gabriel sighs. “It’s not like I’ll be able to order you a stripper again any time soon. Try to cheer up a bit.”
Castiel obliges, but can tell it’s more of a grimace than anything else. It’s rare for him to show nerves outwardly, but they’re starting to bleed through. Easy enough for Gabe to pick up on, but then that’s exactly why he’s been needling him.
“We kinda know this guy, right? Dean wasn’t a dick. Not when we were kids.”
“Which was a long time ago,” Castiel says. “But mother approves of the marriage, so everything will work out perfectly.”

    Summary
      Sometimes, when Dean looked up at the stars, he thought of Sammy's smile and the silly stories he shared with his brother. Dean could not remember how many nights he spoke up to the sky, hoping Sammy could hear him. 
Being an omega was hard in a society that viewed omegas as dumpster fire trash. Dean lost Sammy because of the cruelty of alphas. Now, years after losing every member of his family, Dean is finally caught by the police and forced to confront one of his worst fears. 
It is being dumpster fire trash to some abusive alpha that will slaughter him in more creative ways than any B horror movie.

    Summary
      Lucifer is back thanks to a horrible mistake, and he has a new plan to create an apocalypse with Sam in the middle in a way so much worse than before, but that isn't what Sam is thinking about right now. 
Sam can't stop remember Hell and everything that happened to him there. What will he do to make the pain stop, or, more importantly, what is he willing to become?

    Summary
      What happened if Lucifer didn't want to be the bad guy anymore? He's just misunderstood. But little brother Gabriel has something in mind to help the older Archangel, though he may not like it. This story contains non sexual age play so if you don't like it. Don't read it.

    Summary
      From that fateful day, Sam was more careful. He didn't want to worry Luc. He followed his rules diligently, certain that they were a sign of his love. Occasionally, however, he fell into error. He got distracted, he suffered some setbacks, something slipped from his hands. And Luc was not particularly prone to forgiveness, if not preceded by the consequences of any disappointment. Sam learned that there are different types of bruises and how long each of them takes to heal. Slaps, punches, kicks, various tools. Sam learned to cover the marks on his face, to wear long-sleeved shirts more often and to carefully evaluate the opportunity of each visit to the swimming pool. Most of all, however, he learned to pretend. With friends, colleagues, even with his brother. He knew that none of them would understand the way he and Luc managed their relationship.
