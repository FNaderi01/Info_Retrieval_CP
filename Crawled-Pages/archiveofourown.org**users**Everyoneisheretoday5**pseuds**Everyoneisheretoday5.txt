    Summary
      Even though she was literally in a world where magic fueled everything, even the orbs doing nothing but floating and lighting up the world, Luz still dreamed, because that’s what she was best at. And as Willow shifted against her shoulder, resting her head in the crook of Luz’s neck in the most adorable way, a thought struck Luz out of the blue, taking over her mind with hopeful images of the future. Can Willow dance?

Min’s even seen her stutter through a conversation with a Stanford admissions officer (courtesy of their school’s annual college fair), wide-eyed and sweaty-palmed, and somehow still wanted to talk to her the next morning.But Min’s never seen her on one of her bad days.

    Summary
      He could make out a few words. The witch wasn’t yelling but they weren’t exactly the quietest either. However, once the young boy could piece together a full sentence, he realized how much trouble he had gotten himself into. He was frozen in place, as the one boy he absolutely hated walked towards the counter, still complaining. Of course Mattholomule worked here.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Just a Coffee shop AU :UAlso this takes place about a year later so Gus is thirteen and Matt is fourteen
