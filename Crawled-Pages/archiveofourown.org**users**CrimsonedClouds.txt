    No Archive Warnings ApplyNo Romantic Relationship(s)Todoroki Touya Sawada Iemitsu Timoteo | Vongola Nono Xanxus (Katekyou Hitman Reborn!) Varia (Katekyou Hitman Reborn!) Sawada TsunayoshiReincarnation Implied/Referenced Child Abuse Implied/Referenced Character Death Crossover Sawada Iemitsu's A+ Parenting Pre-Canon Pre-Reborn Touya is 10 years older than Tsuna Moral Ambiguity Criminals gonna commit crime (and have questionable ethics regarding the kidnapping and indoctrination of children) Alternate Universe - Canon Divergence Canon-Typical Violence
    Summary
      Iemitsu doesn't give a damn about him until he finds out about his flames. [OR: Touya apparently can't escape shitty fathers and siblings forced to carry the weight of their fucking legacies. He died without being able to help Shouto. He refuses to abandon Tsuna to his fate.]

    Summary
      Sasuke Uchiha is cheerful, forever smiling, and deadly with a sword in hand. Team 7 is cohesive, capable, and formidable apart but unbeatable when together. This world is better for all of it. [OR: Takeshi and Sasuke are one and the same. Mafioso and shinobi aren't so different, after all.]
