Also special thanks to @the-fear-you-wont-fall who held my hand as I wrote this chapter!1 Year AgoJamieThe one that’s an accidentJamie Fraser was a stubborn man. He knew it himself. Hell, Jenny- his sister- consistently reminded him time and time again.One thing he knew down to the very marrow of his bones- he was in love with Claire Beauchamp.He had accidentally asked her out- almost without realizing it himself. He had stumbled in from work, a bunch of papers for the company’s project in his hands, and dropped them on the couch. She had stumbled out, her hair wrapped turban-like above her head, and a facemask on.“Bad day?” Claire had asked, meandering through to the kitchen and pouring herself a glass of whisky. He nodded, striding across the room taking a seat on the barstool.  “Ye could say so.” Jamie reached in front of him, taking her glass and swallowing the contents in one large gulp. “Damn.” Claire laughed, pouring him another. “Want to get out of here for the night, I ken a place that’s not sae far from here. A hole in the wall little diner. They serve great waffles.” Jamie shrugged his shoulders trying ot shake the day off and ran his fingers through his hair.  Claire laughed, nodding at him. “Give me five to tame these medusa curls and throw some clothes on.”“The Diner” was an apt name: a retro diner with neon sign illuminating the front window. Waves of patrons dotting the red pleather booths as the hours ticked by until only they remained.  He had ordered her pancakes and him some waffles- each stacked a mile high, ‘wi’ all the proper fixin’s ye ken?’ as the illustrious server, Mrs. Crook, liked to point out. That first night she had talked his ear off- telling him stories of growing up around the globe: riding camels in Egypt, spending summers in Boston, and enjoying wine off the coast of Italy. He had nearly forgotten about the work project that night. And it was then, he’ll look back and remember her face smothered with whip cream, a red M&amp;M stuck to her cheek because she dove into the pancakes head first, and smelling like lavender that was the moment he accepted he loved her. Always.The one where it’s a second-not-so-formal-invitation DateThe second time Jamie Fraser asked Claire out was the first time his college best friend and newfound brother in-law met her. “Ask her out, ye bloody fool!” Ian laughed popping open some beers. “She seems like a lass who can hold her own. Almost like yer sister.” Claire had stridden in clad in her teal scrubs, hair a bird’s nest atop her head, and blood on her white lab coat. “I’m so sorry, I told Geillis I would meet her at spin and I was running late in the ER- there was a car crash and damn I’ve never done so many stitches in one sitting!” Ian had just smiled and laughed, shaking his head. Realizing Jamie had company over, her cheeks flushed as she stammered, “Jesus. H. Roosevelt Christ! I forgot my manners. I’m Claire, Claire Beauchamp.”“I ken who ye are lass. Our shared lad doesna stop telling me all about his superhero of a roommate. I’d invite ye to come out with us, but it seems like ye have a busy night ahead, we will catch up soon.”“Rain-check?” Claire asked as she slid off her sneakers.“Aye, rain-check.” Jamie agreed. Claire smiled and escaped into her bedroom.“I like the lass.” Ian said, elbowing his friend and walking out the front door.****The bar was crowded for a Wednesday night. The soft hum of classic rock echoed in the background. Jamie and Ian had decided to meet their other friend, John, out for a round or two to celebrate John’s recent promotion. John was technically Jamie’s boss, but the two had befriended each other years back on a work project, and the friendship had remaind.“Aye, John ye shoulda seen the look on his face when she walked in the door!” Ian laughed taking a large sip of his beer. “It was full on grin. I didna ken our Highlander could smile sae big.” “This would be his roommate, correct?” John Grey had asked in his thick, formal English accent. “Aye. She’s a Sassenach like ye as well.” Jamie sat at the high-top bar swirling the remnants of once cold beer. John took his knee and slightly nudged his friend, grabbing his attention. “And when are you finally going to ask the lady out?” Ian let out a small chuckle and nodded. “Aye, Fraser, when ye goin’ to finally ask the lass out?” “It isna like that…. She’s my best friend and roommate. Drop it.” Jamie rose from his stool and walked to the bar to buy the next round of drinks.****Ian had left early to go help his wife with their newborn. John had bid his farewell to go meet his new lady friend named Isobel. He really hadn’t cared- he loved his dear friends, but tonight they had made him start to think some thoughts that he had pushed far away.The streets of Edinburgh were crisp for the October night and he clutched his jacket tight to his body, rounding the corner to The Diner. He felt his phone buzz in his pocket as a text filled the screen.“I see you walking by The Diner. Come help me eat these stack of waffles. You’re buying.” He smiled as he opened the door to see Claire in their booth, accompanied by a stack of waffles. “Care to share, Sassenach?” He asked sliding into the booth. “They are the world’s best waffles.” She gleamed with a smile on her face.That night, they truly were the best waffles he’d ever had.The one where she meets the boss, againThe third time Jamie had inadvertently asked Claire out, his nerves had gotten the best of him. He had been dying to ask Claire out-planning every night for 3 weeks to get the courage to ask her out-but never quite finding the strength.She was way out of his league, and he knew it. Yet, when the tickets to the theatre were left on his desk with a hand written from Colum stating, “Bring the English lass”- he figured he had the perfect cover. “Your boss…” Claire had said, “Wants me to go with you?”“Aye. Weel… I dinna ken if he means with me – I rather think he just wants to see ye again. Ye are a charmer, Sassenach.” They had gotten ready- Jamie dressed like a Highlander in full regalia, Claire dressed to the nines in a floor length red gown, with a black shawl. She was breathtaking. The night was filled with tender touches from her on his chest- his arm always finding its way around her shoulders or waist, her chest resting on his. It shocked him just how easy it felt to be with her- and more than that, how easy it was to want to touch her. There was champagne and bad jokes of Bonnie Prince Charlie. Colum had been right, Claire was the perfect person to attend the evening’s festivities. The night had ended with her falling asleep on his shoulder in the Uber home. He had carried her upstairs and put her to bed, wishing no more than to do just that for the rest of his days.The third time was the time Jamie knew he had to try to win her heart.The one where the Scot takes a chance He had it planned. All laid out in his mind. It was her birthday and he was going to spoil her, and hopefully make her his own. She would come home from her ER and be exhausted- having no plans to celebrate her special day. He’d be waiting on the couch, have a glass of whisky ready to hand her and tell her he had a surprise. He had wanted to take her to The Diner- Mrs. Crook had special orders for a waffle stack with “Happy Birthday” written in chocolate sauce on the side, accompanied with her favorite thick cut bacon. Nothing too over dramatic- nothing too simple—something that was just them. Just like wanted- just like he hoped for. He heard the keys in the door as Claire came home. She looked radiant as ever when she came in, her bun half falling out of her face, her glasses crooked on her nose.“Oh my god.” She laughed. “What a day.” “Weel, it is a special day indeed.” Jamie almost whispered. “Happy Birthday Sassenach!” She tossed her lab coat on the edge of the couch and plopped down next to him. “Shit. I forgot.” Claire admitted as she shrugged her shoulders. “How do ye forget yer own birthday?” “I don’t know. I rather… Just have been busy with work and I didn’t realize it was the 20th already!”  Jamie shook his head, pouring her a glass of whisky. “You’re the best.” Claire bellowed taking a glass from his hand. Jamie poured his own glass, reaching over to Claire, tipping his glass to hers. “Slainte.” “Slainte.” Claire repeated. “So I was…” Jamie started as he heard Claire’s phone buzz. She looked down and smiled at the text.  She stood and crossed the living room, turning around to face him, a grin from ear to ear.“I have a date tonight! That professor from about a year ago, do you remember? Frank Randall… That’s his name.” Jamie half smiled and nodded. “Aye.” “We ran into each other the other day at the library- he asked me out for drinks tonight. I said yes. It’s been a while since I’ve been on a date, figured I’d have nothing to lose.” Her voice was hopeful, yet somewhat flat, he noticed. Should he stop her? Should he let her go? Did she have nothing to lose? Was he that something she could lose?“Aye, lass. That’s right, nothing to lose.” Jamie stated- his tone flat and dry. He took down his whisky in one sip, swallowing the hope he had instilled to make this woman more than a friend.Damn you, Frank Randall. Jamie thought to himself as he pretended to listen to whatever it was Claire was telling him.He had wanted to take the chance, but had waited too long. Now, any chance he had of winning Claire over fizzled away.Tagged as OutlanderJamie x ClaireOutlander fanficoutlander fan fictionI'll be there for you AUYIKES DON'T KILL mE*backs away slowly*myfic!gammakitty liked this                                    ladytuarach reblogged this from abreathofsnowandwaffles                                                                                                                                                                                    ladytuarach liked this                                    tigergator liked this                                    9catlover9 liked this                                    greerslz1 liked this                                    chalielovesstars liked this                                    chelegankenny liked this                                    imaewfa liked this                                    jdin20 reblogged this from jack-andthestalk                                                                                                                                                                                    hannah-king2014 liked this                                    andthencamemacdubh liked this                                    mamaschops liked this                                    cls2paris said:
