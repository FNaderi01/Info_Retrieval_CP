Local Professional Fitness Trainer Goes To Rio Olympics            
				By Sentinel Staff Report                
	                	                Published September 7, 2016

Professional fitness trainer Jason Estrada, owner of EstradaFitness Clubs in El Segundo, returned home from the 2016 Rio Olympics with his own golden experience as a professional strength and conditioning coach for both the USA men’s and women’s basketball teams.
“I felt that this was an opportunity of a lifetime that I just couldn’t turn down!  This was an awesome experience and definitely a dream come true! A dream that I never wanted to awaken from,” said Estrada.
One of the biggest moments for him was standing courtside at the Men and Women’s Basketball Games as they were being awarded their Olympic Gold Medals.  Estrada said, “Knowing that I played a role in assisting the players to reach the goals that God had in store for them while using my divine gift of being a strength coach, made me extremely proud.”
        ADVERTISEMENT        
As a strength and conditioning coach, Estrada always knew that having his own elite fitness facility would allow him to grow his brand worldwide. However, having the opportunity to go to the Olympics in Rio surpassed them all. Having recently launching the Estrada Fitness Online Program, estradafit.com, Estrada was also able to get members to join while in Brazil.
In addition, every athlete that he got a chance to work with saw the value in his style of training. “Being able to coach these athletes with my mind, body, and spirit philosophy enabled them to achieve optimal results from their training,” said Estrada, who added that he is thankful to God for preparing him to take on such a huge responsibility in Rio.
At Estrada Fitness Clubs, the advice Estrada always tells his clients is, “To always give your best effort, as it will lead to your best outcome. Nothing satisfies me more than seeing that principle carried out by the athletes who represented our country and brought home the gold!”
