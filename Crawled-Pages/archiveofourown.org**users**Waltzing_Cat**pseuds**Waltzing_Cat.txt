    Creator Chose Not To Use Archive WarningsAllison Argent/Scott McCall Derek Hale/Stiles StilinskiStiles Stilinski Erica Reyes Vernon Boyd Scott McCall Allison Argent Derek Hale Heather Caitlin Isaac Lahey Daniellecompliant with season with the exception of the alpha pack No Alpha Pack Stiles being a bad ass the Argent’s getting what they deserve Allison goes through it Scott goes through it Jackson and Lydia are mentioned Danny is briefly present The Sheriff is a Badass Deaton Mentioned - Freeform Gerard mentioned Kate mentioned Derek is bad at feelings The alpha pack and darach happened off screen in another town Bad Friend Scott McCall (Teen Wolf)
    Summary
      Stiles doubles back to the Argent’s house to free Erica and Boyd before making it back home. In which Stiles, not forgetting all about Erica and Boyd very much remaining in the basement saves them, Derek and Peter killing Jackson does make him go through the process of rebirth but he is brought back human and not a werewolf. Allison and her family go through the very legal repercussions of abducting three teenagers and Scott and Stiles friendship is put on hold because of that. Derek’s still the alpha.

    Summary
      There's a pair of married kunoichi in town, new and strange and adopting Naruto like it's nothing. One's an Uzumaki by blood, and the other by marriage, and Kakashi's swept up into their wake with only a token complaint.They give him an excuse to visit Naruto, and if that means turning a blind eye to the things they do that nobody understands, then Kakashi's fine with that. The Hokage signed off on it, after all, so everything's fine.Obviously.
