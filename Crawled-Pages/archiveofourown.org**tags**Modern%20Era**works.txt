    Summary
      Pot pourri de vignettes écrites à quatre mains, qui n'ont pas d'autre lien entre elles que d'être toutes un hommage à Erik et Charles, ces messieurs qui s'aiment et que Marcel Proust aurait appelés en d'autres lieux et à une autre époque des adeptes du Charlisme. (C'est ainsi que dans La Recherche, l'auteur dénomme les homosexuels, ce qui est en soi une trop belle coïncidence, n'est-il pas ?)

    Creator Chose Not To Use Archive WarningsHanschen Rilow/Ernst Robel Melchior Gabor/Moritz Stiefel Wendla Bergmann &amp; Ilse NeumannHanschen Rilow Ernst Robel Melchior Gabor Moritz Stiefel Wendla Bergmann Ilse Neumann Max von Trenk Martha Bessell Anna (Spring Awakening) Thea (Spring Awakening) Melitta (Spring Awakening) Otto Lammermeier Georg Zirschnitz Original Male Character(s)Inspired by Romeo and Juliet Modern Era Underage Drinking Implied/Referenced Homophobia sort of fake dating??? High School Theater let Ernst be sassy Makeovers Rom-com literally everything you'd see in a high school AU dear god someone help Melchior
    Summary
      “All I’m saying is, Romeo and Juliet is the most tired story about the dumbest hetero couple on this earth. And it’s way too overdone.” 
Ernst thinks his version of Romeo and Juliet with a happy ending will win crowds over, Hanschen thinks his epic gay love story would be more interesting. Moritz is frustrated with Melchior, Melchior is somewhat clueless. Ilse and Wendla are just here for shits and giggles.

    Summary
      Instead of burning the witches, Thedas thought it civilized itself by locking them up in dismal, dark prisons and preaching sermons about the wickedness of magic. And when war erupts, every weapon from guns to hexes are fair play. The Champion of Kirkwall, the one free witch in Southern Thedas, vanishes into thin air as war consumes Orlais and Ferelden. The Seekers will do anything to bring Hawke back, and if that means taking her best friend into custody... Varric Tethras didn't count on many things, but nobody saw Maria Cadash coming. The Carta thug from Ostwick keeps secrets of her own tight to her chest while stepping in as an unlikely unifying force in a world gone mad. The only question is whether the people who call her Herald can save her from the past that threatens to incinerate the woman who could save the world.While rated E, most of this work falls squarely within the M rating. Explicit Sexual Content will be marked with a * in the chapter title.

    Summary
      A semi-circle of cupcakes surrounded Jester's closet like a makeshift barrier. She had made sure that each cupcake was a different flavor since she didn't know which one her 'guest' would like best.
Jester watched the closet door closely from the sanctuary of her blanket draped over her. All the lights were off and she clutched her flashlight tightly. Spending the whole night without even her nightlight on was a struggle, but it was going to be worth it. No matter what Jester was going to prove that there was a monster in her closet.

    Summary
  It began, as so many dreadful things do, at a party. 
Darcy falls embarrassingly fast for Elizabeth Bennet, and he has no idea what to do about it. He’d like to court her—date her—hang out with her, whatever the term for it is these days. Her lifestyle horrifies him and her friends and family bring out the worst in him but he still wants her—when it comes to her, he cannot seem to help himself. Elizabeth is never quite certain what to make of Darcy. He’s aloof and haughty and casually insulting, but she keeps catching glimpses of something deeper in his character, something that intrigues her. She doesn’t like him but she is drawn to him—and then she learns something that makes her hate him, just in time for him to ask her out in the most insulting way imaginable. In a flash the passion and resentment becomes more than either one can bear, and they find themselves in bed together. It’s only one time—then a second, and a third—and somewhere in the midst of angry sex and angrier recriminations, they forge a bond that carries them out of the wreck of their beginnings and into a happy ending that neither one saw coming.

    Summary
      Sandor Clegane is fine- he has a job, an apartment, and his dog Stranger. Sure, he has secret goals and desires, but those are shoved down far enough that even his therapist is having trouble finding them. And that's fine. But when Gregor dies, Sandor is thrust back into the world of the society, with archaic customs, stuck up nobles, and one little bird that may change everything... ;)
(Sansan modern-ish marriage AU, hard to explain but give it a read and perhaps you'll like it :))

    Summary
      He didn't even remember doing the crimes he got trialed for, but now he was deemed insane and unfit to live in society. The young man swears to take revenge as soon as he was deemed sane enough to leave, and thanks to two good friends, his leave will be sooner rather than later.
