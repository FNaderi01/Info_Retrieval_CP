8Happy 80th Birthday John Lennon!“I like people, and I’m also a chameleon. I’m just – I become whoever I’m with. And so, if I’m with a mad man, I become mad. And if I’m with somebody I love, I become lovely. Right? So really, I’m just – I’m like a cloud in the wind. I just float around.”

i can’t tolerate the grown adult men who try to gatekeep classic rock and belittle young girls for getting into it. first of all, it’s not that serious. second of all, teenage girls were the core audience for most of these bands you’re acting entitled to. and third of all, it’s not that serious at all. let people enjoy things.

10         These four men created music of such joy and inventiveness that it captured the imagination of the world, and has never lost its grip. Even a few bars of ‘She Loves You’ or ‘Hey Jude’ have the power to pull the listener out of the everyday, and into a fantasy world where every moment oozes with possibility, and love conquers pain. The Beatles have the magical ability to recreate the idealism that sparked their own creation, and open that source of inspiration to us all.  - Peter Doggett
