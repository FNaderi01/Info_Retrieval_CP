Before you so rudely interrupted me with your squalling… Ye’re all dry now, so no more noise, aye? Your mother’s sleeping. Ah, yes, I was saying that ye were a bit of a surprise. It’s true. But so welcome. ‘ He places the swiftest of kisses on her head ‘We didna expect to conceive  on the honeymoon. But well, in all the excitement, pills were forgotten! ‘ The baby settles and seems to sigh in agreement.‘Aye, my wee prawn. That’s right. Get comfortable. Ye are, you ken.  All shades of red and pink, and wrinkled t’boot.’ He laughs lightly, careful not to joggle the small body held so carefully within his hands. ‘Your mother’s very fond of prawns. And of throwing them too.’ He smiles at the memory.‘You know of course already that ye have the best mother in the world. You’ve had nine months to get to know her, aye? Claire…. ‘ He chokes up, pauses while he wrestles with his emotions, all the while gently stroking his newborn daughter’s bright auburn hair, marvelling at its softness. He can’t tell whether she’s actually fallen asleep again, though her eyes are closed. ‘Claire, she loves you so so much, mo chuisle. As do I’The baby suddenly wriggles and whimpers. ‘So you’re still listening then?’More struggles.‘Aye, Wee Red, I know you’re fussing, but your Ma, she needs her rest now. She’s had quite a day of it. Yes, I ken you have too. But you’re going to have t’just make do with your Da.’ He can’t help but grin as he pronounces the last word, still hardly believing that he is holding his own child, this perfect mix of him and Claire, their love made flesh. He leans down and very gently presses his lips to his daughter’s forehead, softly, lingeringly.At this tender contact, the baby opens her eyes. Jamie knows that she is already very familiar with his voice, its bass tones. He has been telling tales of old Scotland to the bump for months. But she is still unused to his touch. His bonny bairn. His mouth twitches. All these names he has for her already. She continues to stare solemnly up at him, trying to focus.The weight of her in his hands, this warm body, so delicate, and yet so strong, infinitely precious. It seems so extraordinary that just hours ago, he had only known her as a curve within Claire, a series of movements and kicks, and now here she is. The smallest parcel of snuffles, sighs and light soughs. And the smell.  A milky sweetness that is already ingrained within his psyche. And he can’t stop looking at her. He is enchanted by the smallest details. Her perfect wee fingers. The hint of translucency within her ears. The length of her lashes. She is a miracle of life. Within the absolute quiet of the bedroom, he almost imagines he can hear her heartbeat. He can certainly feel her breathing, a series of tiny vibrations, though he canna really see it, so slight is the rise and fall of her chest.He involuntarily clasps her tighter. To love her and protect her with his very life is now his raison d’être.She’s already survived so much. The scare at 4 ½ months when Claire had had significant bleeding. Then again at 7 months, at which point she was put on bed rest for the remainder of the pregnancy. But she was strong, his wee girl, so braw, and determined. ‘Like your Ma’ he whispers into her hair.He pulls back and strokes her cheek again, and then her brow, and watches in fascination how her eyes close again, and within moments, he feels just the tiniest change in her breathing, as she falls back to the sweetest slumber, held safe in her father’s embrace.His Faith.
