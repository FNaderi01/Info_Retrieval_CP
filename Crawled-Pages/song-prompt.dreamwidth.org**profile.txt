                 Mini Bio
                Hello! This is a community that is dedicated to using songs as prompts. All fandoms are welcome. fic_promptly and oddible inspired this place, but with this community, SONGS are the prompts. For example: NCIS, Tony DiNozzo/Tim McGee, Mr. 80 SPF Sunblock wearer.Then, a comment fic is written based on the prompt given. The minimum is 100 words and there is no max. When you post a song, you can use whatever link you wish, but longer lasting links are encouraged(Youtube is ideal). You can include lyrics, but you don't have to. It takes all kinds for fanfics, so your kinks, yaoi/yuri/het, gen, whatever is okay. Warn for spoilers/not work safe/mature/triggers, etc in the subject line.Be nice, no needless bashing, don't be a jerk, and above all, have fun!
