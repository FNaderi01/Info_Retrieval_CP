    Summary
      There is so much you can do in 60 seconds. And especially motivating is the knowledge that 60 is all you get. Yeah, you have eternity, but it's the moments that count, that can can alter the course of your life. Slash/Yaoi/malexmale/etc. Might be a bit of an enthusiastic manwhore (soooo graphic on this site, meh), but will settle down after saving humanity... that might take a while.

    Summary
      I wasn't meant for war. I didn't like to hurt others. But that was before I died. Now in this world, I'm constantly in danger. I have learned to survive, and have the skills to do so for a very long time. But now I have a cause. A reason to fight, not just survive. Legolas/OC, Slash (major), is boyXboy, don't hate.

    Summary
      Damian is half angel, half demon; a rarity and a prince in Hell, as raised by his mother. For his eighteenth birthday, he's given a captive angel, Jason, to do whatever he wants with. But despite his demon upbringing, Jason can see the potential for good in Damian, and that just might mean that God's put him down in Hell to try and set the half-blood on the right path.
