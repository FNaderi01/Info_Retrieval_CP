    Summary
      It didn't mean anything to them that Mary was raised a hunter or that John was a Man of Letters in training, they were more than okay with having a secret relationship together, away from prying eyes. But years of keeping the secret, including keeping Marys son Deans parentage a secret, the both of them are more than a little bit tired of being quiet.

    Summary
      Peter gulps when the man turns back, the reflective surface of the goggles blocking his expression. The man gives Peter a long look before turning to leave."Go home, child." He says, voice surprisingly soft. (In which Steve is a terrible dad but Peter still loves him. They find the Winter Soldier together. Tony is the cool uncle. Fluff.)

    Summary
      The thing about Bucky these days is that, while he might be a semi-mythical assassin, he's also vulnerable—the kind of vulnerable that makes total strangers want to drape a blanket over his shoulders and take him to safety. The problem is, of course, that Bucky is already safe. 
  The first time it happens, Bucky has no idea how to react. He and Steve are walking down the street, when a slight woman takes in Bucky’s terrified eyes, the dark circles so bad they almost look like bruises, and Steve’s protective hand resting on his lower back, guiding him down the busy sidewalk (but it must look possessive, to someone looking for a sign), and comes to the wrong conclusion.

    Summary
      Steve lives in Stark Tower and doesn't have much to do when he's not going after Hydra strongholds.  He attends charity events to make Pepper happy.  He goes hiking with Sam.  He hangs out with Clint in Bed-Stuy and watches Dog Cops.  Sometimes Tony gives him super alcohol in a sippy cup.  Sometimes he sees Bucky out of the corner of his eye and wonders if it's real or if he's starting to lose his mind.Alternately, the one with terrible jokes, a foot chase through the Lower East Side, and a tiny little robot named Shitcan.

  Summary
    Short stories from the Toasterverse, because the author gets panicky writing long form stories built around plot and has to finish something in order to function.Phil has problems with these people.  So does the Author.

    Summary
      Peter and Deadpool are held captive by a super-villain that has an inclination for torture. After she boasts her untarnished record at never having hurt a child or teenager, Peter is forced to break the truth to both her and Deadpool. “Did you know I have a perfect record?” The villain collects a rusted pocket knife, tracing it up Peter’s arm, over his shoulders, down to his collarbone, as though considering where to cut. Peter focuses on controlling his breathing, fear twisting awfully in his belly. “You may look down on me, Mr. Spider-Man, but for all the righteous suffering I inflict, I’ve never hurt a child. Not once.” “Y'know, I don’t think you do,” Peter blurts. At his words, Deadpool's stare intensifies. “Have a perfect, non-child harming record, that is.”
