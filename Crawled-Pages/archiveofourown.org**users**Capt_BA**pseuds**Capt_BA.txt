    Summary
      Zack Fair is fine. Everything is fine. But sometimes he thinks about things he'd rather forget. And sometimes his flashbacks are so vivid, he might as well be strapped right back to Hojo's table. Double Entry for Whumptober 2020 No. 1 Let's Hang Out Sometime and Sephtober Week 1: Death - Defeat.

    Summary
      Nobody grows up dreaming of becoming a glorified torturer in a lab coat, but here you are, hands buried to your wrists in some poor experiment's guts. Cloud and Zack's time in Hojo's lab as told from the perspective of an employee who only ever wanted to become a doctor. A companion piece to Losing Cohesion.
