    Summary
      Luz makes a surprised chirping noise in the back of her throat and pauses her scribbling to gently touch the inside of Amity’s elbow. 'Sorry if I startled you,' it says, and then she’s back hurriedly scratching on her own paper, tongue sticking out slightly.It’s the first of their shared gestures that act as a stand in for absent communication, though neither of them note its significance at the time.Amity huffs in amusement and angles her notebook so it’s easier for the other girl to read.---a small collection of shorts about love language, as told from the two who speak it and others who notice it.[this fic is fully finished behind the scenes! i will be uploading one of five chapters every other day, to be completed on the fifteenth of october.]

      “Amity,” Luz breathed, and she shattered. “Amity,” she repeated, in all of the ways her mother hadn’t and never would. It’s all gentleness and affection and love, and she couldn’t physically take it anymore.

    Summary
      The rain was burning everything around her, but Luz’s eyes were caught on Amity – cheeks far more flushed than Luz had ever seen them, panting softly and barely holding up her own umbrella-like forcefield to prevent herself from getting burnt. The acid rain bit at her feet, which were turned in on each other, and added to the feeling of her hunched-over shoulders – that Amity looked small, and flustered, and vulnerable.“I’m sorry,” Amity began, a tremor on her lips that Luz wanted to, but couldn’t, discount to the cold. “I didn’t know where else to go. Can I stay?”The Amity-runs-away-from-home AU, because something is up with her parents, and we all know it.

    Summary
      Amity Blight is forced to spend her week-long school break away from her home from an infestation problem. After a chance encounter at the fair, Luz invites her to stay over at her place as the perfect excuse to hang out. Amity reluctantly agrees and is now constantly battling against her emotions of sleeping in the same place with the person she likes while Luz thinks nothing more but a fun sleepover. Perhaps this is a chance for something new to start? Of course, the wild world of the Boiling Isles have more in store for them.
