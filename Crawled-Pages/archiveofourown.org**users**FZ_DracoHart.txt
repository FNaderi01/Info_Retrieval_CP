    Summary
      “Do you love me too, my knight?”“I am no knight.” ---Protect the princess. A simple promise Weiss made to Queen Summer.She was but a child back then, ignorant to the true weight of such an oath. As the time goes on, the realization of its solemn weight burdened both her spirit and her heart. For she is but a lost Atlesian mongrel, weak in body and spirit, unworthy of love blessed by the crown princess of Vale. Then the smoke fades and the mirror breaks, and her life will never be the same. But one thing never changes. She is still oathbound to Ruby.  (A very long overdue WR Week 2020 Day 7: The Princess and The knight)

    Summary
      Alluring red, secretive black, mystical silver. A beautiful young woman. Something beautiful to convince Weiss she isn’t a fool to dance the night away with a succubus. Something to fool herself the choking poison she laps from these lovely petals is the sweetest nectar.But what could you expect from a fallen heiress? One who shamelessly took up a soldier’s oath without real calling, merely a formality to gain cheap financial incentives funding her Hippocratic oath.What a fool Weiss Schnee is, to think she could be something other than a game for this silver-eyed huntress.---Read the tags, then read this at your discretion

    Summary
      The last thing Ruby expected in her summer backpacking trip is meeting a scruffy, guitar-strumming, white-haired girl singing “Country Roads” while hitchhiking a truck. But damn, despite being a total bitchy prick, that girl is actually really hot! Ruby might or might not have a crush! Is this Ruby’s shot at summer romance before she goes home to truckloads of lectures and her hair-pulling frustrating thesis?A backpacking university student meets a grumpy farm girl in a town deep in the mountains of Colorado. Things surely won't go wrong, even when the farm girl has lots more than meets the eye.

    Summary
      Find why the problem exists. Find how to solve the problem. Find what to do to execute the solution. Such is the surefire way to do everything: from getting A grade paper to…taking care a frustrating crush to a silver-eyed girl? Weiss probably should find new approach to her newfound love problem, instead of treating it just like another college assignment. 
But hey, don’t blame her! She’s just another broke mining engineering student!

    Summary
      (White Rose Week 2020: the princess and her knight)
There is something bubbling up inside of her, something she’d never felt before. And for the first time in years she thinks for a moment that her armor is too heavy to move in, that her arms are not strong enough to lift her sword. The way that the princess dances, with suitors and her family and friends, it makes her heart beat with something entirely unfamiliar to her.
Winter sees it—takes notice of her sudden breathlessness, presses a hand to her shoulder, and tells her to let go.
And so Weiss does.
(At least, she thinks she does.)
Or;
She was a knight, her duty was to the crown, was to protect it and serve it as best as she could—but the call, the sweet and warm melody of friendship sang to her.
(And more often than naught, it was in the form of a rose.)
