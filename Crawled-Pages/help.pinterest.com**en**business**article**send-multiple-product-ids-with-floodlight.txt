              Send multiple product IDs with Floodlight
            Before you get started
Add the base code and relevant event codes to track activity on your website
Learn how to use macros to pass information to Floodlight 3rd party ad tags at the Google Help Center
            Pass multiple product IDs
If you're using Google Floodlight and support adding multiple products to your cart or purchasing multiple products, you'll need to make adjustments to the Pinterest tag in order to pass back multiple product IDs. This is necessary for running dynamic retargeting campaigns. 
Use the macro function and the product IDs parameter in this syntax:
https://ct.pinterest.com/v3/?tid=2619214552931&amp;event=pagevisit&amp;ed[line_items][0][product_ids]=11149134,11149144,11149126,11168014&amp;noscript=1&amp;dbgppce=trueThe [product_id] parameter only supports single product ID passback. [product_id] supports multiple comma separated values.
For example:
Sending a single product ID: [product_id] = 123,456,789 will pass the data as single value
Sending multiple product IDs: [product_ids] = 123,456,789 will split the IDs on the comma and pass back all product IDs as separate and unique values
