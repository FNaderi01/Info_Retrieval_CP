THE GARDEN GROVE STRAWBERRY FESTIVAL  HOLDS CONTEST TO HONOR OUTSTANDING FAMILY               
				By Sentinel News Service                
	                	                Published March 25, 2019
 The 61st Annual Garden Grove Strawberry Festival is a non-profit organization is holding an on-line contest to find an outstanding family in Garden Grove or its surrounding communities – a family who as a whole has given generously of their talents to better their community through selfless acts of public service.   The winning family will be named Theme Grand Marshals in support of this year’s theme, “Celebrating Family.”  They will be honored in the Saturday, May 25 parade, treated to a VIP breakfast and lunch with TV and film celebrities, be interviewed by the local press and will receive wristbands for a day of free rides.  The person who has nominated the winning family will also receive two wristbands.
Members of the community may submit information about a potential candidate by filling out a form on the festival website at www.strawberryfestival.org/family.  The deadline for submissions is midnight May 1, 2019.
The festival is a charity event that has brought in over $7 million for local charities since its inception in 1958. It will be held Memorial Day Weekend Friday, May 24th through Monday, May 27th, 2019. Friday hours are 1:00 p.m. to 10 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. and Monday from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.  Admission is free. Special one-price ride-all-day wristbands will be offered for all festival days.
        ADVERTISEMENT        
The four-day event, which is the second largest city festival in the Western United States, will be held at the Village Green between Main Street and Euclid Avenue in downtown Garden Grove. Last year’s attendance was over 300,000.
Highlights include the Friday evening official giant strawberry cake cutting ceremony at 6:00 p.m. at the Showmobile (Acacia &amp; Main streets) when free cake is served to over 2,000 people.  Saturday morning begins with a 5K Run followed by an 8 a.m. VIP celebrity breakfast at the Garden Grove Community Center, with proceeds going to We Give Thanks. Next is a parade at 10 a.m. with floats, bands, equestrians and characters.  Many film and TV celebrities will be honored in the parade.
All four festival days will include 35 carnival rides, 5 contests, over 200 food and sales booths, games, music and live entertainment in the amphitheater and Showmobile.  Contests, held in the festival’s 550-seat amphitheater, include the Berry, Berry Beautiful Baby Contest, Redhead Roundup, Strawberry Idol Karaoke, and Tiny Tots King and Queen.
For additional information, call (714) 638-0981 or visit www.strawberryfestival.org.
