		  A Soviet war poster conveying the message: "Don't chatter! Gossiping borders on treason" (1941).
Soviet posters during the Eastern Front were visual aids meant to elaborate a certain point in an accessible form, such as the attitudes of the Soviet Government to current events taking place at the front, prevention of defeatism and pessimism, or the inspiration of the troops and the people. The Soviet posters of World War II are works of art and reflect elements of the Soviet cultural heritage. Such posters were often displayed at special stands, referred to as "windows of TASS".
Posters differed both on workmanship and the form. Some were crude caricatures, while others were paintings on military topics or popular photos, presented with an explanation of an event, a quote from the works of Vladimir Lenin or Joseph Stalin, or a poetic comment.
