    Chapter Text
    From the moment they stepped through the barrier to 9 ¾ time slowed to a hazy sluggish blur that seemed to go on around him without any care in regard to whether he was a willing participant in its passing or not. Draco idly watched as first year’s struggled between the unfamiliarity of leaving their families behind and the awe that seemed to encompass them as they feasted their eyes on the Hogwarts Express for the first time. He watched house friends reunite and felt sudden dread lurch over him at the thought of seeing anyone from his own Slytherin House, but felt it’s looming imminence, nonetheless. He reached for the chain around his neck absentmindedly looking for some reprieve as the bond continued to hum under his skin, he could see Harry’s mop of dark hair ahead of him walking between both Weasley twins. As his fingers closed around the lion, the recesses of his mind dragged him back to whispered confessions behind makeshift Quidditch sheds. Draco begins to wonder yet again about this bond, and what it will mean for the two of them should it not fade as the Headmaster, and Severus instructed. Selfishly he almost hopes for it because it will surely mean that the two boys will have an excuse to be seen together without real consequence. Nevertheless, Draco finds himself grateful for every moment that he feels the bond’s dull ache settled firmly in his gut, as it means the two boys are still connected. Draco muses that after all this time, after everything laid bare this summer that they’d always be connected, there’s no mistaking that. But the bond is an almost tangible tether, an invisible string keeping him connected to Harry always. The thought of severing the connection left Draco with an overwhelming sense of panic. To distract himself Draco unwillingly pulls himself into the present and begins scanning the platform in search of familiar faces, not out of fondness but out of the pressing need to be in control. He did not want to be caught off guard when reuniting with Pansy, or Crabbe, or Goyle. Though he was sure neither of his prior cronies would be in search of him, as last term they’d grown apart due in large part to Draco’s desire to live inside himself and avoid human interaction at all cost. He knew however, that Pansy would not be as willing to set their years of friendship aside and would most likely see right through him as she’d done quietly that last term of school.  Not one for letter writing, her absence had not been felt that summer. Though even if either of them had desired to write, it’s not as if Pansy would have known where to send the owl. Of course, she knew, she’d been to visit him in the hospital wing the morning they were set to board the Hogwarts express; not daring to be seen speaking with him by anyone important.  Alas, they said their goodbyes, there, under Potter’s curious gaze. He knew he could trust Pansy, their friendship though one of convenience initially had grown into one of mutual understanding. They came from ‘noble’ pureblood families it was expected that they be friendly with one another, ultimately, he knew that his family hoped that one day the pair would marry. Though looking over at Harry, head thrown back in laughter at something Weasley had said, he knew that would never happen. Though it wasn’t long ago that an anxious, stoic, Draco resigned to marry her or any other pureblood girl his parents pushed upon him as it would be better than the alternative, and disappointing his father hadn’t been an option until now. Pansy was like him, to the world she was harsh, cruel, narcissistic, but on the inside, she was just as afraid as Draco and this is what had made them grow close over the years. They had a mutual understanding, and respect between them, their friendship was nothing like what Harry had with Weasley and Granger. Their relationship could barely skim the surface of what the golden trio shared with one another, but it was all Draco had. Well, it was all Draco had, until Harry that is. He didn’t think Pansy would dare approach him out in the open on the platform, especially without knowing the damage his absence had caused over the summer. For all he knew he was already an outcast within the pureblood community, and for the millionth time that summer he felt a surge of anger run through his veins at Severus keeping him in the dark. He’d known that facing his Slytherin housemates would be difficult, especially as he was out of practice in his stoicism. However, he really hadn’t put as much thought or anxiety into what sort of rumors might have spread about him in his absence. He tried to calm his quelling nerves, knowing that Pansy was sure to at the very least fill him in once they’d made it back to the dorms, void of prying or inquisitive eyes. He knew at once that he was failing miserably at hiding his diminutive break down when his eyes locked with Harry’s. He took a deep breath to steady himself and reign himself in and then graced Harry with a soft half smile, their signature, before vacating any remaining emotion from his face. He could tell that Harry was worried, the brunette had never been even a little practiced at hiding his own emotions and Draco was sure that it was difficult to look at Draco like this after so long of being fully let in. Shit, it was hard for Draco to go back to this place after allowing himself this summer of reprieve. But Harry knew, he knew that Draco had to do what was necessary to survive this year in the Slytherin dorms, they both did. Draco was once again pulled from his inner agony, but this time it was the soft voice of Mrs. Weasley which startled him a great deal. “Draco, dear…” he turned to face the rosy cheeked woman and was met with a soft smile and a knowing look. She took his face in her hands as she spoke, “It’s going to be okay. You’re always welcome in our home, and I look forward to seeing you again, maybe at the holiday’s, yeah?” Draco felt his face heat from the intimacy of her actions and her words, he was left at her mercy and could do nothing but grace her with a smile and small nod of his head. Her smile quirked up until it met her eyes, she patted his cheek, “there’s a good boy, I suspect I will have to leave the taking care of to Harry this time.” She turned to face the brunette who had been watching the exchange take place with a look of such fondness written plainly across his face. “Harry, dear, do take care of our Draco – and be sure to bring him home with you for the holidays, I won’t hear any disagreement on that.” “Of course, Mrs. Weasley,” Harry said, completely unable to hide his grin that daft wanker, Draco thought keenly. She smiled between the two boys, patted Draco’s cheek again softly for good measure, and then began making her rounds ensuring that everyone had everything they needed and then ushering everyone towards the train. Draco let out a breath he hadn’t known he’d been holding in and began following the large group of redheads towards the train. He stopped short, purely on impulse and turned back towards where Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were standing waving goodbye to the rest of their children as they each ducked onto the Hogwarts Express. Without thinking, and without taking full account as to who might be watching he strode back towards the pair, stopping directly in front of Mr. Weasley. He felt his cheeks heat but kept his nerve. “I just wanted to thank you Mr. Weasley, I know it couldn’t have been easy initially accepting me into your home, but I’m grateful that you did. I’m grateful to you both, very much, and – well, I just wanted you to know.” Draco extended his hand out to Mr. Weasley and looked up to be met with a smile. Mr. Weasley shook his hand firmly, “It was no trouble at all my boy, do take care of our Harry this year. I expect we’ll see you at Christmas.” Draco smiled at them both and allowed himself to be pulled into one final hug from Mrs. Weasley before turning back to meet up with Harry at one of the entrances to the train. He noted internally that he could still feel the pulsating ache of the bond and let himself feel a small sense of relief. “You’ve gone soft, Malfoy, you know that don’t you,” Harry teased with a grin knocking their shoulders together making the bond thrum and the ache slacken. “I wonder who’s fault that is, Potter,” Draco replied soft smile fully in place. As they entered the train, they met up with Weasley and Granger who had already settled into one of the familiar compartments. As Draco eased in, next to Harry his mind began to wander once again this time fixating on what the Weasley’s had said. Initially, he thought Mrs. Weasley’s holiday invitation was just one of polite extension, knowing fully that she had meant it, and would welcome him at the holiday’s with open arms. However, Mr. Weasley’s words wrung in his head, ‘I expect we’ll see you at Christmas.’ Draco honestly hadn’t given a lick of thought to the holiday’s, his main focus on just getting through first term unscathed. Well, that and speaking with Severus about what happened in his absence. What did the Weasley’s know about, that he didn’t? Who had already decided that Draco was to spend Christmas at the Burrow, not that he was complaining in the slightest, he felt safe there, Harry was there. If anything, Draco figured that he wouldn’t be leaving the castle that year, let alone to travel for any of the holidays. Draco felt his anxiety quirk up, and not for the first time that day either. He knew assuredly that if Harry knew something he didn’t, that Draco would be the first to know. “Draco,” it wasn’t spoken by Harry, but by a very soft-spoken Hermione. Draco lifted his eyes to meet her expression and was met with one of concern. “What is it?” She asked, voice matching her gaze. He now had the attention of both Potter and Weasley he mused silently, just barely refraining from letting out an anxious laugh at the situation. Never in a million years did he think he’d be sitting here, thigh pressed against golden boy while his Gryffindor gang worried about him. Not that he was complaining, but he wasn’t sure it would never feel like his normal. He sheepishly shrugged, thinking of how best to answer Granger’s question.“Both Mr. and Mrs. Weasley implied that they expected to see me at the Burrow for Christmas, Draco replied taking in Weasley’s eye roll before directing his attention back towards Granger. “That is curious isn’t it?” Granger replied brow furrowing as she met Draco’s gaze. “I don’t understand what the issue is, isn’t it a good thing you’ll come back with me?” Harry announced looking at Draco softly, “I mean you’ll be safe there with all of us, surely you can’t go home.” Draco mused that Potter’s admission had earned another Weasley eyeroll, and Idly wondered how many they’d manage to conjure before the train arrived at Hogwarts. “Yes, Harry obviously it’s the safest place for him, and of course the Weasley’s are nothing but the picture of kindness so it makes sense that they would extend the invitation, but this early? Surely, The Order knows something that they’ve failed to share with us,” Granger replied though still clearly lost in her own world of thought. “I thought it was strange also, I’d honestly figured that if anything I’d remain at the castle but hadn’t thought that far ahead until after the Weasley’s extended their invitation and it got me thinking,” Draco replied.  “Oh great, we’ve got another Hermione. Is this how it’s going to be now, the two of them rambling on like this?” Harry kicked Weasley in the shin and gave him a look, “they’re right Ron, it is a little strange. Already making holiday plans and the term has yet to start.” Before Weasley or Granger could respond to Harry’s statement they were startled by a knock on their compartment. Draco watched Harry slide the door open just a sliver, and the stark black hair and dark eyes of Pansy Parkinson appeared. He noticed her expression go from slightly alarmed, probably in regard to Harry’s proximity to Draco, to completely blank. “I just wanted to make sure you’d made it back; we’ll catch up in the dorms yeah?” Draco gave a curt nod in response, and then she was gone. “You Slytherin’s have an odd way of talking, is it always that stiff and proper or just when you’re both pureblood prats?” Weasley was graced with another kick from Harry, and an eye-roll from Granger. “Honestly Ronald, your communication style consists of grunts and one-word answers so you’re not one to talk.” Weasley let out a huff and resigned to look out the window albeit, petulantly in Draco’s opinion. “Draco, you’ve really had no word from anyone this summer?” Granger asked pointedly. “No, and it’s been maddening to say the least, I have no idea what I’m walking into. I don’t even know if Severus will be at school, or even speak with me if he is.” He felt Harry squeeze his knee gently, “Hey,” and Draco could do nothing but comply with the pull to get lost in a forest of green. “We’ll figure it out okay. You have us here, and we’ll figure it out together.” “Of course Draco, it seems as though you’re stuck with us” Granger said with a smile and Draco could do nothing but smile back. “Should you both just try and bypass Professor Snape, and go straight to Dumbledore – Especially if that bond still hasn’t worn off by the time, we make it back to school?” Draco immediately began shaking his head, “No, I know Snape - that would only anger him. Give me some time to try and speak with him directly before we go to the headmaster.” “Let’s just test out the bond at dinner, if it’s too painful we’ll figure out who to go to then yeah?” Draco nodded at Harry and let himself be pulled into Potter’s side, knowing that their time was dwindling fast and hoping to just let himself enjoy the small amount of time they had left. The only thing he knew for sure, was that he knew nothing. He had not an ounce of an idea as to what he was going to be walking into this school year, but it didn’t seem to matter so long as he had Harry. He’d made it this far already and knew that even if he could he’d never go back.
        Notes:
          Well, we made it! Thank you so much to everyone who stuck with me during the lulls in writing and updating frequently. I appreciate everyone's love and feedback! I know the ending is a little open-ended, but I have definitely thought of some sequel ideas, let me know if you'd be interested in seeing where this plot takes our boys next! :)
  Notes:
  I want to preface this by saying that I have been working on this for a few months now. I started it almost immediately after finishing "A Game of Gazes" (by all means go and read this fic!! &lt;3). I haven't quite finished it yet, I'm about 17 chapters in and I'm just a little stuck. I decided to start posting chapters little by little in the hopes that some of you will encourage me! I want to second this by saying, I am such a sucker for soft Draco, I can't help it, it's what comes naturally to me! I feel like a struggle with writing Harry just a little bit which is why his chapters are shorter, but I feel like both perspectives are necessary sometimes and I'm sure you guys understand! I want to finalize this by saying I welcome any and all feedback! I hope these first 2 chapters will get you guys excited, I promise I will be consistent with posting. Like I said, I already have 17 chapters finished and ready to post just needed to work through the ending a little bit! Also, I love you all, it was all the love I go on my first fic that truly encouraged this one!  Last, last, last thing:Follow me on Tumblr! &lt;3
