    Summary
      Mizuiro had just been trying to earn a new client. Ichigo found an interesting man instead: Throne-Guy with the easy elegance of a big cat and a tongue as sharp as Ichigo's. Or, alternatively: sass as a tool for flirting. It's surprisingly effective.

    Summary
      it started as pettiness, as many things do in Xanxus' life, but the brat is easy to love and Varia Quality is difficult to find. Even if he had to train the brat himself.
