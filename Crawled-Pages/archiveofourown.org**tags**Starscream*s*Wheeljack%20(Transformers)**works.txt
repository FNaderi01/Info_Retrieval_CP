    Summary
      Starscream and Wheeljack work for rival gangs, but after an accidental night together and a few nights after, they both come to the realization that they can do more together than with their own factions. (pretty much everything is the same except instead of a war it's organized crime)

    Summary
      Unrelated drabbles and ficlets created from prompts given to me on Tumblr that don't quite have a home elsewhere.***Trying to make this even more obvious:As I've had it asked before - I don't take fic requests here. These ficlets are fills for prompts given to me by Tumblr users during certain times of the year that I invite people to send me ideas. There is never a guarantee I'll actually write a fill to a prompt, and there is no associated timeline with any potential fills, as I look to these when I'm lacking inspiration. However, if you are interested in a particular fanfiction request you can find more information at my dreamwidth account.

    Summary
      (this fic became more in depth than originally planned) Starscream and Wheeljack live in the same apartment building, and Starscream would find any excuse to invite Wheeljack over, even if it means breaking something for him to fix. Fearing rejection, Starscream tries to never make his feelings known. Too bad everyone around him isn't as oblivious as Wheeljack.

 “How can you have broken up with me?” said Starscream snidely as she raised her glass again. “We were never dating.”In the same way you and I aren’t dating? replied Wheeljack’s own voice in her ears and she shut her eyes, jaw clenching. God damn it.

    Summary
      All the Con Claiming Culture fics that exist independently of each other!Decepticon Claiming Culture is the practice of one mech claiming another (or multiple) mechs as “theirs” in a public and permanent fashion. The idea of ownership isn’t attached, instead the idea is that it’s a permanent contract between mechs, where one is protected, cared for, and closely involved with the other. IE, if you mess with the Claimed mech, you are messing with the person who made said claim.

    Summary
      The whole world is run by a select few people. The people with the money. You're either rich or poor. There's no in between. And if you're one it's unlikely you'll ever be the other. Wheeljack lives alone in the last remaining house outside the city. He works as a vendor on a street corner until he's given an offer he can't refuse. Or. More like an ultimatum. "Come work for me. Or lose everything you have."Wheeljack reluctantly agrees and finds himself diving headfirst into a world of wealth and excess. Where bots are slaves, and freedom is a fantasy. Far from anything Wheeljack can stomach.
