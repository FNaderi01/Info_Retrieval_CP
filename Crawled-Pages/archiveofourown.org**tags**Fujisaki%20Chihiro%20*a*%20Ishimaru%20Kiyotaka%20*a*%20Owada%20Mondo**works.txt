    Summary
      So many ships in Danganronpa, either canon, non-canon or not-even-thought-of. This fic is basically my creation of a Tsurezure Children-based idea, if the Tragedy didn't happen, and the students were free to express their feelings to their significant someone.No destruction, murder or despair, just teenagers go through hell, trying to understand love for another person... Wait, isn't that almost despair? Welp, there wouldn't be hope without despair, and these teenagers need a lot of it!

    Summary
      Junko Enoshima knew what Hopes Peak Academy was hiding, and she was planning on using it as a stepstone to despair. However, her plan changed when the school moved quicker than expected, and now she has to alter her plan. But it was no problem for her, no. Junko Enoshima wasn't the Ultimate Analyst for nothing, and if she has to use her own class for her agenda, then so be it. Class 78 was far easier to manipulate than Class 77, and she could always use more people on the side of despair.

Among which, the Ultimate Programmer and Ultimate Biker Gang Leader join their friend group in enjoying some of the attractions.Even prodigies have to have a little fun now and then.(Please see the notes for a few disclaimers!

    Summary
      Chihiro spent her first day in the afterlife in tears.Dying and regaining all those memories is a lot to handle, but when she watches the trial and hears all the things Mondo says, she waits for his arrival in the afterlife ready to forgive him. All she asks is that he holds her for a while.
[Note abt the fix-it aspect: Chihiro Fujisaki is trans. After Mondo comes forward, he tells all the others that she's a girl, not a crossdresser, and they accept her and promise to continue thinking of her as a girl.]

    Summary
      Hajime Hinata, an average boy leading a very unexciting life, gets the chance to change all of that with new superhero powers. Now as both Hajime and Mister Bug, he has to learn how to manage his new school life at Hope’s Peak while protecting Japan from the evil villain Hawkmoth.
So pretty much Miraculous but Danganronpa.
(Though I have changed up the story)

      Ishimaru Kiyotaka has lived his entire life under the cold gaze of his parents, the weight of his soiled name and his grandfather's sins, and the belief that he was just not meant to be happy. Mondo Oowada and Chihiro Fujisaki are willing to do anything to free him and teach him how to live with the belief that he's worth more than the world has to offer.

    Summary
      It's a new school year at the Hope's Peak Academy. The students of the 78th Class moved on since the tragedy that hit their normal school lives - in particular, Chihiro Fujisaki is trying her best not to think about it, to forget, even though deep down she knows it's wrong. However, her attempts to have a normal life in which her only problem is to confess to her crush are useless when Kokichi Ouma suddenly decides to come back into her life, just for personal amusement, to remind her of *that thing*.Yes, because there's something about Chihiro that nobody knows - a terrible thing that she did, or better, that *they* did last year and that cannot be spoken out. It's exactly like the Ultimate Supreme Leader loves to tell her every time: there are two things that Kokichi Ouma, Chihiro Fujisaki, Celestia Ludenberg and Hiyoko Saionji have in common. First, they are all liars; second, they are the only ones who could solve the disturbing mystery that a dead girl left behind.Well, actually there's a also third thing: they are involved in her murder.***Please, read notes for the "Trans Chihiro Fujisaki" topic. Remember, this is an alternative version of the original story of the Danganronpa universe!
