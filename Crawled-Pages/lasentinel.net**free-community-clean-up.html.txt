Free Community Clean Up            
				By Staff Reporter                
	                	                Published March 22, 2017
On Saturday, March 25, the free Community Clean Up is back at the Sentinel from 9:00am-3:00pm. This is the community’s one-stop event to dispose of unwanted materials around the house. The event is a drive-thru, allowing the community the chance to drop of items without leaving their cars. Mothers In Action is happy to assist in providing the services to the community this year.
This community event is made possible by partners and representatives including Mothers In Action, Los Angeles Sentinel, Supervisor Mark Ridley Thomas, L.A. City Council President Herb Wesson, Assembly Reggie Jones-Sawyer, Los Angeles Sanitation, Copy City, Crenshaw Chamber of Commerce, Public Works, Shred-It USA, Empowerment Congress West Area and SoCal Gas.

Partners have said this this about the community clean up event…
“Recycling and properly disposing of materials is an important first step in keeping our communities healthy. I am pleased to partner with so many trusted organizations to bring these types of green services directly to our residents.”—L.A. City Council President Herb Wesson
“With this event, we’ve made it easy for you to dispose of hazardous household waste and confidential documents. I urge you all to take advantage of this opportunity to clean and beautify our community, and make it safer as well.”—Supervisor Mark Ridley Thomas
“We are proud to be a part of this community event that contributes to the well-being of our community through safe and secure disposal of hazardous waste as well as sensitive and personal documents,”—Armen D. Ross, Crenshaw Chamber President
“LASAN welcomes the opportunity to serve city residents and our customers by hosting community events such as this Household Hazardous Waste &amp; Electronic Waste Collection event.  We look forward to this year’s event and a continuing environmental partnership with the residents of the Crenshaw community in the great Council District 10.”—Enrique C. Zaldivar Director, Los Angeles Sanitation
Some of the items you can bring include: paints, automotive fluids, cleaning products, pool and garden chemicals, aerosol cans, unused medicine, auto and household batteries, fluorescent tubes and bulbs, mercury- containing gadgets and SHARPS (needles, syringes, carpules, lancets, endo files, prefiled pens, etc.) Electronic materials will be accepted as well including: computers, printers, cables, telephones, televisions, microwaves, video games, cell phones, radios, VCRs and electronic toys.
There are some materials that will not be accepted at the event such as: business waste, containers over 5 gallons in size, ammunition, explosives, asbestos, construction waste, fireworks, furniture, radioactive material, biological waste or tires, refrigerators, washing machines/ dryers, conventional ovens, paper or computer software.
Shredding confidential documents will only take place between 9am-12:30pm and only 2 (33 gallon) trash bags per customer is allowed. Please have papers loose in bags and ready to be shredded.  Shredding services are sponsored by Empowerment Congress west Area.
This is a chance to get rid of all those items that required specialized disposal and recycling. The drive-thru line for the free Community Clean Up starts at Bronson and Coliseum.
For more information, call (323) 290-0456 or email Tracy Mitchell at tracy@lasentinel.net.
