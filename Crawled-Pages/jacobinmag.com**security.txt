      Security Policy
        We take security seriously, and have been very careful about dealing with subscription and credit card information. Because of this, we’ve chosen to serve the entire website over SSL. 
In order to safeguard your payment information, we never store any credit card information — it is transmitted (over SSL) to our payment processor and we only have access to a randomly generated token that uniquely identifies it. This allows us to make it easy for you to renew without risking your credit card information being leaked, even if our servers were hacked.
If you don’t want us to keep even that info, you can always go to your profile and click “delete” below the payment information.
