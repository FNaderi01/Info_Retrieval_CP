    Summary
      “Belos gave me a choice. He told me to get rid of Luz, one way or another. And I did. Now everyone’s back in the realm they belong in, nobody got hurt and Luz is forever out of danger. It’s best for everyone involved that way.”“Keep telling yourself that, Lily.” Eda glared daggers at her sister. “Oh, and solid job on locking your own protégée out of the Boiling Isles, by the way.”“What are you talking about?”“Amity went through the door after Luz,” Emira chimed in. Her voice was scarily monotone. “Now she’s trapped on the other side of the portal you just destroyed.”—Summer has come to an end, which means Luz is forced to return from ‘summer camp’ and resume her regular life back at home with her mom. When she leaves, she promises she’ll be back soon.Unable to overcome her fear of telling Luz how she feels about her before she steps through the door, Amity finally finds the courage to do it when the door closes behind Luz and makes the rash decision to follow her.Then something goes wrong, and now Amity is stuck in Luz’s realm with her crush, far away from everything she’s ever known.Getting back home might prove more difficult than she’d originally hoped...

    Summary
      Humanity has been compromised. Nobody ever thought that New England would be the ones to launch thousands of missiles to destroy the world, but you know, stuff happens. The missiles were made pretty poorly, though. Some of them had landed in peoples front yards, not going off. Those were only the second most dangerous things survivors had to look out for, the first being the undead.
