History[edit]
  Mirza Najaf Khan, after whom Najafgarh is named
  The Battle of Najafgarh
Najafgarh was named after Mirza Najaf Khan[3][4] (1723–1782) the commander-in-chief of the Mughal Army under King Shah Alam II.[5][6] He marched several kilometers from the capital of Shahjahanabad to establish a military outpost, which would guard Delhi against attacks by British, Rohillas and Sikhs. He built a strong fort,[7] in the suburbs beyond the capital city, and settled a small number of the Mughal here. That fort was later named Najafgarh.[8] After the death of Najaf Khan, Najafgarh later became a fortified stronghold of the Rohilla Afghan chieftain Zabita Khan (b. 1785).[9]
During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, and as a part of the Siege of Delhi,[10] the Battle of Najafgarh took place on 25 August 1857[11] between Indian rebels and British Raj soldiers.[12] Approximately 800 people were killed.[13] After the defeat of the Mughal troops in 1857, Delhi came under the control of the British Empire in 1858. Najafgarh became a part of Delhi district[14] of the Delhi Division of Punjab Province. Delhi was transferred from the North-Western Provinces (later the United Provinces) to Punjab by the British Government in 1859.[15]
In 1861, the North-Western Provinces education system was abolished in Delhi,[16]:18 and a new system for schools modelled on the Punjab education system was introduced by W.M. Holroyd, the Inspector of Schools for the Ambala Division.[16]:47 New schools were opened at Narela, Najafgarh, Mehrauli and their suburbs. Several schools were opened in the following decades. The Delhi Normal School was shifted to Najafgarh from Kashmere Gate in 1911.[16]:71[17] The Delhi Normal School, with a small attached Model School,[18] trained its teachers in closer accordance with European methods than any other Normal School in Northern India.[19]
In 1947, Najafgarh became a part of independent India and fell under the union territory of Delhi. Najafgarh Assembly Constituency was established in 1993 when the Delhi legislative assembly was re-established after the Constitution (Sixty-ninth Amendment Act, 1991) came into force. This declared the Union Territory of Delhi to be formally known as National Capital Territory of Delhi.[20] Najafgarh is now one of the most populous electoral regions in the National Capital Region of India (NCR). Najafgarh is surrounded by 70 villages bordering Haryana. The borders are 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) to 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from the main Najafgarh Market.

Transport[edit]
Indira Gandhi International Airport is the nearest international Airport to Najafgarh. It is the primary airport serving the whole NCR Region. The Metro network extended from Dwarka to Najafgarh as part of Phase 3 of Delhi Metro connecting it with the satellite city of Noida. The official deadline for this project was December 2016 and the project was completed in September 2019. The metro connects the Dwarka station and the Old PHC (Public Health Centre) of Najafgarh. However, it is unlikely to connect the Rural Belt which has led to a demand for new Metro to Dhansa.
Najafgarh is well connected by drivable roads with major destinations all over Delhi and Haryana. The Main Najafgarh Road (officially Shivaji Road) connects Najafgarh to the city proper of New Delhi while a number of other roads connect it to several villages along the Delhi-Haryana Border.
