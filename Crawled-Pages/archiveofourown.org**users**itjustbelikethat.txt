    No Archive Warnings ApplyEllie/DinaEllie (The Last of Us) Dina (The Last of Us) Joel (The Last of Us)i've been obsessed with these two ever since the trailer dropped they're my latest fixation so ofc i had to write them being dorks which means dina's super flirty and ellie's awkward and basically clueless featuring a guitar! and singing and close proximity and an almost kiss and joel being dadly and giving ellie shit for her crush on dina fun times all around! (m for language) now feat. a piano! and stargazing! and a bunch of emotions neither of them will talk about and generally just a metric ton of fluff this is now an ‘it’s raining and there’s only one umbrella’ au +8k words of pining and suffering and flirting and uh... yeehaw?
    Summary
      Whenever Dina pushes closer, Ellie takes a step back. It doesn't always work out the way she'd intended.(Started as a fic about Ellie, Dina, and a guitar. Since then, it's evolved into a study on just how deeply Ellie's convinced that her feelings are unreciprocated, and how she's managed to delude herself into thinking that Dina isn't totally and completely enamored with her.)
