    Summary
      Finding out about his parents' murder at the hand of the Winter Soldier, Captain America's old war buddy, pushes Tony Stark into a very dark place and he turns to the former HYDRA assassin with a burning fury, part of him screaming for revenge.Finding out that Steve knew and didn't tell him pushes him over the edge and he lashes out against the super soldier, but just as Steve is about to retaliate the Winter Soldier takes Tony by surprise, by knocking Steve out and surrendering.The Winter Soldier knows that to be free HYDRA must be crushed, and for that to happen his best chance is the resources of Tony Stark, when Captain America shows up in Bucharest the fragmented memories of who he once was tells him that the Captain will protect him and bring him to the Avengers so the Asset goes with him, but when the Captain is about to attack Iron Man with deadly intent he makes a choice and goes against the voices within.The Asset neutralizes the Captain and surrenders to Iron Man, hoping that he will be able to convince the man to use HYDRA's own weapon to take them down.

    Summary
      The Complete Cases Of Sherlock Holmes And John Watson. All 366 cases plus assorted interludes, hiatuses, codas &amp;c. 
1900-1901. Into a new century but the adventures still continue for the dynamic duo. There are dead schoolboys, a dying clubman, an elephant with no legs, a dirt-digging journalist, a disgusting lizard (no, not Mr. Randall Holmes this time), a dodgy wager, a doomed landowner, a devious beneficiary and a dissimulating female. Things are much as normal then – but a surprise is lurking for one of the dynamic duo and it will involve a vampire of all things.

    Summary
      "You would risk exposure to save me?" She looked down and nodded, unable to meet his eye. 'Why?""Do you know Elvish Your Highness?" "Of course.""Then you know why."~ ~ ~Once thought to be extinct, the Dark Elves, lead by the infernal Malekith, seek to invade Asgard. Made aware of their presence and the looming threat to his people, Odin Allfather sends out a call to the far corners of the Realm Eternal. The call to arms. Every able bodied man is to report for duty to repel the invaders. Her brother is no different. And yet he is. Permanently injured during the last war, he is unable to fight, yet is determined to do so. For the honour of the family. Unable to allow such a thing, she takes his place, unknown to her family until it is too late. Thrust into the heart of a war, her mettle is tested. For she hides more than who she is. Will her lies hold out when confronted by the Silvertongued Prince himself? Or will they crumble and all her secrets be brought to light?

Everything is going well for the athletic youngster until Rayne's stepbrother, Ichiro, moves to Australia.The young and oddly beautiful man from Japan turns the competitive swimmer's head and makes him question his sexuality in the blink of an eye.Head over heels in love, Gabriel and Ichiro stumble headlong into a relationship without taking the time to get to know each other, and unaware of the other one's trauma.Causing chaos at all fronts, their naivete backfires, and their romantic idea of clinging to their love has to face an acid test.

    Summary
      A Radiodust storyline.It has been a few months since Charlie and Vaggie gathered everyone at the hotel and started their redemption project.  Angel has been working hard on getting clean, even rediscovering a few hobbies while under the watchful eye of Alastor, which helps keep Valentino and his crew from interfering (most times).  Valentino is getting less and less co-operative and demanding more and more of Angel's time.Alastor hasn't killed anyone (at the hotel) and is sometimes even becoming social with Charlie and Vaggie as Husk and Niffty seem to have found a common bond and have begun spending more time with each other.  This seems to be an improvement for Husk as he seems to be drinking less often(when Niffty is around) at least. Vaggie had been on the rooftop with Angel, He had grown to enjoy the rooftop as a place he could go to, even on his own.  He took to tending plants he was trying new things as well just get some air.  That's when Angel was taken.  Alastor had set to finding Angel as soon as Charlie and Vaggie informed him and they started searching in her limo.

    Summary
      Thor is a poor jötunn runt trying hard to scratch out an existence on his tiny farm. He is forty-one and longs for a wife and family, but being small, he holds little hope of ever seeing his dreams come true. There is but one highlight in his life: his Vanir slave, Loki, whom Thor had bought as an adolescent boy ten years ago at a slave auction.
Loki was a seiðrmaðr in training before his life was upended by the Æsir-Vanir War. The only thing he longs for is freedom, and he will say and do anything to get it, even if it means pandering to his master’s deepest desires.
