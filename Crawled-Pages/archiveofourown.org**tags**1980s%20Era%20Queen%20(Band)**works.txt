    Summary
      If you have found this story and not read the first installment or the second, please do so.  The existing plot points, characters and establishment of their lives will matter.  We are entering a time in Queen's history that contains many triumphs but will soon lead to a road of tragedy and loss.  The band is at the top of their game as they begin recording their next album.  But the strain of 10 years together is starting to show.  Creative tension and the need to keep up with the pace of a rock &amp; roll lifestyle will begin to create problems.  A new darkness is emerging in the world that will have an enormous impact on all their lives.  It will threaten everything that matters and cause each of them to react in ways they could never imagine.  Will the group survive all the turmoil?  Will Brian and Roger survive the stresses placed on their relationship?  And - what will be the final thing that makes Brian and Roger willing to reveal their most sacred secret to the world?  I hope you will join me for a dramatic journey through the 80's...one filled with love, laughter, tears, mistakes, forgiveness and remembering what matters most...friends will be friends...right til the end.

    Summary
      Truth be told, Oliver had never been a particularly reckless person. But when his best friend asked him to move with her over 4,000 miles away, he couldn’t help but take the chance. Now he has it all – a new home, a new job, a new life. Turns out, though, that life still has a couple curveballs to throw him and one in the shape of a certain famous frontman. Question is: is he willing to take this chance or is it better to let your heroes stay just that?

    Summary
  Bowie dropped by and we did some work in the studio.
The writing and recording of 'Under Pressure' on a whim, which Roger has strong feelings about, in which John completely forgets his killer bassline, there isn't a guitar solo to be found, and what gets shown off isn't what was expected to be.(Or, the realisation that 'Under Pressure', while a very recognisable song in its own way, does not sound like a typical piece by Queen)

    Summary
  You wouldn't think to look too closely, would you? If you did, you wouldn't see my smile, because it's hidden behind my hand; wouldn't see the colour of my skin without a blush. And you definitely wouldn't see anything at all like the tracks of tears.
  Why not? Because I'm Freddie fucking Mercury, darling.(Or, Freddie's life as he sees it is one far separate from others. All he wants, he aches for somebody to love.)Posted as preparation for the Freddie Mercury first person POV challenge that I have learned will be happening in early June.

    Summary
      It's raining, again. Downright pissing down. Big shock in England, of course. (Not.)It's raining, they've all been in or just gotten back to the flat in varying degrees of grouchiness, oh and they also need food. Especially since there was meant to be a gig tonight, but it got cancelled for fuck knows what reason-- they can play in the rain, who cares? Apparently someone does.It's late, though not too late yet and there's nothing more on the table for the remainder of the night, so what are they going to do?(Or, the members of Queen learn a bit about themselves when they haven't got a gig during a rainstorm)

    Summary
      Just a Queen fanfic which is basically a shitpost. No idea where the story will go and how it will end, but this takes place in early 1987 and it’s about a 16 year old girl from 2020 who magically got transported here. There will be loads of inconsistencies, errors, and timeline(???) mistakes, but overall this fic is just written for fun and not meant to be taken seriously. Hope you enjoy it and my “humor”.

    Summary
      "Brian, if I don't get to fuck you in one way or another real soon, I'm committing murder," John rushed out."I – I figured," Brian said slowly. "Your suggestion?"John picked at a loose thread of their pillow. "Alright, just – don't hate me," he said quietly."John –" Brian began."IthinkRogershouldjoinusinbed," John said in one breath, looking anywhere but at Brian.Brian sat up. "Come again?"  "I think Roger –""No, I heard you, I just – what in the hell? Roger?".Or, the one where John and Brian have some serious communication issues, Roger is trying to be a good friend, Freddie Knows Everything but Would Prefer Not To, and the whole "Friends with Benefits" thing has never worked out for anyone, ever.

    Summary
      One time in what felt like another life, John had written You and I, thinking about Brian. Now it was only arguments, anger, frustration, a mix of negative feelings straining their relationship. All of this was getting on his nerves, and he’d felt the need to it put down on paper, where he could speak without his boyfriend’s replies. At first, it started with a few words, and now he had a full song, Back Chat.
