History[edit]
The HKCD was founded on 11 October 1952, at a price of 10 HK cents. Its stated aim was to serve as the voice of the local Hong Kong commerce, with a focus on worldwide economies, especially in Hong Kong and China. It also covered sport and, on weekends, offering columns and serialized short stories with pictures.
Early coverage of horse and dog racing was curtailed by the government the early 70s, so as not to promote gambling, leading to a severe decline in circulation.
In December 1989, a majority shareholding was acquired by the Joint Publishing (HK) Company Limited (the joint company of The Commercial Press (H.K.) Ltd, Chung Hwa Book Co. and Joint Publishing) for HK$160 million.
In 1995, HKCD launched a mainland edition, in cooperation with mainland publishing companies. Since 1996, an online version has been available.
In May 2005, the paper was upgraded, priced at HK$3 in Hong Kong and overseas, while in Mainland China, it sold for 3 yuan within Guangdong Province and 5 yuan in other provinces.
The new version of the paper emphasizes business news from Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta, along with some sports coverage.
In 2015, assistant editor-in-chief Long Zhenyang was placed under “political measures” for comments he made during the 2014 Hong Kong protests and regarding the demolition of churches in Zhejiang. For the following year, he did not work as an editor but was allowed to continue writing, and in February 2016 resigned and sought political asylum in the United States, comparing the sociopolitical climate in Chinese politics to the Cultural Revolution, and saying that "All hope for social reform, and reforms to China’s political system, have now been extinguished."[1][2]
