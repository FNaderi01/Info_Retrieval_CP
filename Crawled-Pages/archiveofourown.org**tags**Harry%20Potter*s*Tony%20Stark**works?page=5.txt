    Summary
      At times, it would seem that Mr. Potter has the indescribable urge to reach out and strangle Mr. Stark. Others, he is more inclined to ignore him. It's when he is too far gone in his anger that the ... interesting reactions come to light. Of course, kissing the man was just to shut him up.Mr. Potter never did see the smirk Mr. Stark wore when this happened.

    Summary
      “Well that was surreal,” Tony tells Happy as they drive away. “The guy wanted me to make a phone call with his fireplace. I mean, I talk to my walls all the time, but that’s different you know? My walls talk back. I’m pretty sure this Harry guy doesn’t have an A.I installed in his fireplace. He didn’t even have a television.”Tony Stark crashes into the world of magic quite by accident and it falls to Harry to make sure the budding superhero escapes with all his limbs — and his mind — intact.

    Summary
      Harry worked for W.A.N.D., the Wizarding Association of National Defence. He liked his job, and he liked being a lonely, miserable, old bugger. But when he's assigned to protect Tony Stark he's unprepared for what he'll have to face: a nosy, interfering superhero intent on getting Harry a life, or perhaps just getting himself one.

      Lovegood. A cozy bakery that Tony had discovered purely on accident - well, one of the only good accidents that had happened in his life. An accident that led to him finding the beautiful green-eyed, messy-haired man that he falls in love with.
