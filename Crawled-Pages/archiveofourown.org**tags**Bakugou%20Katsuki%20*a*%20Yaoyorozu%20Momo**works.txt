    Summary
      "Todoroki," Momo says after he doesn't say anything else. "Are you…are you thinking what I think you are?"They sit in the silence for a moment, Momo's heart rate picking up a little as she waits, trying to anticipate what he might say."That depends," he utters before moving his eyes to meet hers. "What do you think I'm thinking about?"---They've both got an itch that needs scratching and think they have the perfect solution. It's mutually beneficial, after all, and it works for them. Until - of course - something happens that changes everything.

    Summary
      Momo, that sweet angel who was hiding away such a fulfilling sex life. She has not one, but two sexual arrangements with the two best looking guys from their class Katsuki Bakugou and Shouto Todoroki. So not only were they fighting over the hero rankings but now this girl. It seems the only way to see who really deserves Momo was for the battle of the Princesses hand in the bedroom.
------It was Katsuki’s turn to flip things around, “Then why was she begging for my cock if she already had you?” Bakugou heard him click his tongue.
“Were you not satisfying her? Could you not make her cum for you Icy Hot?” Katsuki provoked even more as Shouto pushed him away. The two males were standing face to face not wanting the other to be right.
“Tonight, we’ll have a threesome. The first one to find her sweet spot is right,” Shouto proposed

    Summary
      The flowers start showing up about a week before, which is about the right time for her father’s business acquaintances who can only vaguely remember that her birthday is in late September to be sending their polite, obligatory regards. Momo is glad that the bouquets are at least small and easily managed, even if they are showing up at her office enough times for the delivery man to stop asking if there ‘is a Yaoyorozu Momo here’.---The thing they don't tell you about work is that it is a marathon, not a sprint. A Yaoyorozu Momo birthday story.

Affection-Starved Todoroki Shouto i have an influx of dudes who hate deku or baku and love the other and since i'm 'E for everyone': i write them equally infuriating so everyone's equally dissatisfied. i dont have a greek mythology phase; i have a greek civ class that i need to pass deku: son of poseidon: afraid of water bc bakugou tried to drown him in a ymca when they were 5 midoriya is gr8 but he's SO close to losing it. like aang from atla characters' views aren't my own. kirishima: his constant state of laxness comes off as lowkey psychopathic oops. my man todoroki gets sentimentally attached to a cowboy hat
    Summary
      Bakugou stares.Aizawa stares back."You're half horse."At this, the emo My Little Pony cosplayer's ear flicks, almost as if he's irritated. "And you're a whole idiot. What's your point?"-OR: I take every Percy Jackson book and mash it together into a single fic because I have no respect, and center it around Bakugou, with Midoriya forced to tag along because he doesn't have a ride home.Carpooling along are under-qualified babysitters Todoroki, Yaoyorozu, and Kirishima, sent to limit property damage.Along the way, they accidentally befriend more kids reeking of daddy-issues who have a capable resolve against Bakugou's bullshit attitude, because nothing like  life-threatening,  saving-the-world-and-bakugou's-mom pressure that really creates bonds.  (you definitely don't have to read PJO to get the gist of this bc i diverge from the plot anyways because i like fucking shit up.)

    Summary
      For someone who’d just spent over 40,000 yen to have a bunch of pretty boys (coiffed and dressed impeccably in charcoal suits) serenade her, Hadou Nejire looked rather miserable. While she certainly didn’t look out of place in the host club with her couture silk dress and probably brand-name bag, distress clearly weighed on her shoulders, her mouth set in a perpetual frown.As the rest of the hosts filed off to greet their customers, Bakugou strode to her booth, steps unhurried.“You just spent half a week’s salary on a bottle of champagne,” he said, never one to pull his punches. Sliding into the booth himself, he poured two glasses out for her and himself. “Haven’t you gotten over yourself yet?”(or: Most hosts give pretty smiles and spew empty words. Bakugou Katsuki does neither.)
