      Stiles had enough. After everything that happened since werewolves came into his life and watching his friends die one after the other, he turns to magic to get stronger and maybe change things.He had the perfect plan and then God decides to get involved because he didn't like how the future turned out. For some reason, he seemed to think Stiles was the perfect candidate to change that.Now, if only he had warned Stiles about the gender change and the whole deal with the Angels and Demons before sending him back in time, he would have been golden.

    Summary
      Wherein Klaus is alone until he isn't, his siblings are trying their best, the apocalypse doesn't happen, and maybe, just maybe, they can all find a little peace.***Dave is blindingly bright and so very good, and if life has taught Klaus anything, it’s that he doesn’t deserve good things.(He learned that the first time dad had shoved him into an icy mausoleum. He learned that when Luther grinned and taunted Klaus when his jaw was wired shut for eight weeks, as if it was a blessing that their brother couldn’t open his mouth, screams trapped behind clenched teeth as cold dead hands reached for him, always trying to take take take. He learned that when he woke up from his first overdose in the hospital with Diego at his bedside, looking pissed and worried but alone, and he learned it his second, his third, his eighth, when even Diego stopped coming. He learned that when weed was the only thing that kept the ghosts at bay, when that stopped working and then it was only narcotics, and then it was only crack, and then heroin, and then and then and then-) (Klaus isn’t bitter and sad, not at all).(His legal Name is still Number Four).***Standalone fic!

    Summary
      There's a faintly wonky, sideways pair of snowmen beside the front door that Jon did weeks ago to distract Martin from panicking one particularly rough morning, and the size difference between the two, the over-exaggerated skinny body and sour face of one and the big smile and bobbled hat of the other, still makes him laugh when he sees it. It's as Jon's stopping to survey the two of them one morning two weeks later, when the exhaustion has settled into background noise and the nausea hasn't, that it hits him. He gazes for a long moment and says out loud, without even meaning to, “I'll need to add another one soon.” He freezes.

    Summary
      Wherein Klaus finally gets his happy ending.***Klaus remembers the first time he met Dave. He remembers fear closing off his airway; he remembers the harsh rattle of gunfire, the ground trembling with the force of nearby explosives, the throbbing ache that clung to his very bones. He remembers the confusion and the panic as he was shouted at, dazed and hurting, until a pair of pants was shoved into his hands and a helmet onto his head; he remembers hours of trekking through damp, hot rainforest in pitch darkness, clutching that stupid fucking briefcase to his chest. He remembers the second time he met him, too, or maybe just the official time. He remembers clear blue eyes and freckles dotting sun-kissed cheeks; he remembers golden curls plastered against sweat soaked skin, and a warm hand settling firmly in his own, and he remembers “shit’s crazy, I know. Don’t worry, you’ll adjust.”He remembers a warm, genuine smile, and the way Dave’s hand lingered just a little too long in his own.

      "Respectfully Alpha Trion,” Optimus said, optics hard, servos balled up into fists at his side. “The moon has caused me enough grief. It cannot be restored, the most powerful mech on all of Cybertron tried and failed. He has paid more than his price for our hubris.”Cybertron is fallow and unstill, energon is fought over and jealously guarded by high walled settlements and vicious raiders. Optimus can no longer hide in the Yuss settlement, he has sparklings to rescue and the past to face.Broken Earth AU(Don't need to have read Broken Earth to follow along)

    Summary
      Ellie saw the flash from the gun, her eyes widening in despair. The sound crushed her heart, and an animalistic cry ripped through her throat as she realized who the target had been. Agony seized her as she realized that-- once again-- she had been spared and that Dina, however, had not.In a rage, Ellie pulled her gun up and shot wildly, blindly, allowing her other senses to take over in the darkened landscapes. Occasionally there’d come a shout, a whine of despair, and Ellie would know she’d shot one of the bastards responsible. She was trembling as she yelled, “I’ll gut you all like pigs! You hear me? You’re dead! You’re fucking dead!”

    Summary
      You’re making a mess, is what Diego wants to snap back. Instead he hears his mom’s voice clear as day say ‘boys will be boys’ and without thinking he’s moving on autopilot.Diego can feel his hands clenching rhythmically at his sides before he’s moving forward to take the bowl from Klaus and ripping the apron off in one smooth motion. Discarding the bowl to the side he works on getting the strings untangled and slips the apron over his own clothes.“Out.”He has so much work to do. The pancake is beyond salvaging, the kitchen is a mess, and he’s fairly certain the batter is inedible.Aka: the fic where Diego’s mothering instincts go wild

    Summary
      **NOT EDITED WORK; GRAMMAR &amp; STORYLINE MISTAKES**I decided to do this fanfic about a hypothetic Season 2 because I'm afraid of what might happen there. I'm not in the creators' minds to suppose things more than I should, but I don't want to get spoilers to get this work done or to watch even the trailer (which has already been released, but I'm not watching it; I hate trailers). I'm not doing this to pretend that things happen as I like, but I am truly worried about how Season 2 is delivered. Maybe it's because Westworld (HBO) was my favorite series until its Season 2 also fucked it up most of the things done in it; it got more complicated and inexplicable than it should have been, which might also happen in the second season of TUA. I'll stop talking. This is just our favorite dysfunctional family trying to fix up the mistakes they've done in their lifes and some twists that might also be cool.I’ve already finished publishing it, and I’m really happy how it turned out to be. There are still some unresolved questions, but just to make you think! :D If you’re still thirsty, you can always read a brief Klave one-shot I have on my "Multi-universe" work.Enjoy!
