Countries in alphabetical order[edit]
I think someone should put the countries in alphabetical order...maybe ill do it later Zephyrprince 17:46, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)
Fanta Sours[edit]
Someone forgot to add Fanta Sours. I added it to Australia since I live here and I've had it before. Don't know about USA or other places.

Countries with Fanta[edit]
I added South Africa, since it wasn't on the list. The flavours are identical to South Korea, curiously enough. —Preceding unsigned comment added by ManicParroT (talk • contribs) 14:14, 9 March 2006
Fanta is also in Nigeria —Preceding unsigned comment added by 142.156.1.223 (talk • contribs) 15:56, 26 April 2006
Fanta Light (UK)[edit]
I notice "previously known as". Fanta Light was completely replaced with a new drink (Fanta Z) due to Light being a complete disaster. (I'll vouch for that, it tasted horrible).
Fanta Z was introduced with a bizzare advert campaign involving people spitting out Fanta Light due to it tasting so bad
http://www.ephinx.com/tvadverts/34/fanta-z-goodbye-fanta-light-advert.html
therefore fanta light is a discontinued drink. not just the old name for fanta z

Hitler's Favorite Drink?[edit]
A few vandalism reverts ago, there was some quip about Fanta being Hitler's favorite drink? Was this vandalism or not? —Preceding unsigned comment added by FX 72.197.133.100 (talk • contribs) 16:04, 23 November 2006
According to Cola Wars part 2, it is said that Nazi headquarters is described as beingf "prime consumers" of coke products —Preceding unsigned comment added by 87.192.93.252 (talk • contribs) 19:51, 12 February 2007
Ireland[edit]
Can I just say that the "Ireland" and Northern Ireland bit needs to be changed 
Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom even though it shares the geographical Island 
with the Republic Of Ireland

Fanta ad campaigns[edit]
Hey all, I found the Fanta ad campaigns (launched in 2007) on the net. Shall I add the OFFICIAL YouTube links?
Pre Fanta[edit]
i own a pre Fanta Fanta bollte, still filled. It's called Citrun limonade-gazeuse, sugarfree.  The bottle is almost the same Bottle as the later Fanta models, only the ripples go all the way to the top. Bottled in the local Amsterdam Coca Cola company, before they stared to bottle Fanta.
