    Summary
      A Blade Runner's job is to track down malfunctioning or disobedient Replicants and forcibly "retire" them. This isn't the first time Neil's had a Runner after him, and it likely won't be the last. The fact that this Runner shares a face with someone he thought dead may cause some issues, though.

    Summary
      A random post got Andrew the attention of a guy he's slowly starting to fall for. He'd never expected to feel this way about anyone and now his entire life's been turned upside down. The only problem? They've only ever communicated online and Andrew's scared that he'll not be enough in real life.
