    Summary
      Who is she? If she’s so much 'more', containing so many multitudes, who is this suddenly foreign version of herself that’s been formed out of deceit? The Doctor. That’s it. She’s just the Doctor, and that will never change. The thing is, she wants to do better. She can do better, she knows she can do better.But unfortunately for the Doctor, the universe seems determined to prove her wrong.

    Summary
      In the Gallifreyan Empire, Emperor Rassilion works with his High Council of sorcerers to bring order to a ‘chaotic’ world filled with Normals and unruly mages. Slavery is their pillar for society and they destroy those in opposition. It was a shame for them that a previous empress, one Romanadvoratrelundar, created a clause, The Timeless Child Clause, enabling any mage children of the Founding Houses full right to the throne. The Clause was bound in an ancient magic; unyielding and irrefutable. The revolution believed there was only one surviving house member, a young woman who gave birth to an extraordinary mage. This mage would soon grow up into a beacon of hope for all though the High Council grow aggravated with her. It’d be an even bigger shame if the assassin they sent to kill her has a traitorous heart; a heart that beats for his target.

    Summary
      Yaz Khan is the new PE teacher at the same school as the aloof, secretive, mad-scientist Doctor Jess Smith. Within a matter of moments of knowing each other Yaz is put on edge by the Doctor especially after everything her colleagues have told her about the unreadable woman. Can the two teachers keep it professional or will their feelings about each other cause issues for students, staff, their jobs and each other?(This work has nothing to do with the actresses that portray these characters on screen, this is based off of descriptions of the characters alone. The actresses are real people with real lives and families that are just doing their jobs, please remember to stay respectful)

    Summary
      The Tardis was dark as Yaz padded barefoot down the corridor, but a soft, peaceful sort of dark, with just enough light for her to find her way. The walls hummed softly, and Yaz let her fingers trail along them as she walked, feeling a calmness settle over her. She wasn’t sure if she believed what the Doctor had said about the ship being alive - she never really knew when to take her seriously or not - but right now Yaz could imagine it being true.
Or: Yaz is having trouble sleeping. The Doctor helps her out.
