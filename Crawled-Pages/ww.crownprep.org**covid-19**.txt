Crown Preparatory Academy &gt; In Response to COVID-19
			In Response to COVID-19:
It has become clear that the battle against Covid-19 will not end anytime soon. We all must do our part to slow the spread of the disease and give our healthcare system time to provide the best possible care to all affected people. As a result, all STEM Prep schools, including STEM Prep Elementary, Crown Prep Academy, and Math and Science College Prep, will start off the school year with online instruction (distance learning) for all students.
