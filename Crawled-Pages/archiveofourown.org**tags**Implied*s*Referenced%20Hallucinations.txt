    Summary
      There was no rational thought left within his mind. She’ll hate me if I refuse. He tensed under her touch. It would be rude to deny her. Every cell in Konstantin’s body was dying to get away, but he was frozen solid. It’ll be alright if I just do whatever she wants.

    Summary
      Island existence, a concept that should be oh so simple. Until you have no service, monsters attacking at night, a lack of food, a child who is now your pseudo sibling, an angry boyfriend who's probably going to kill you and a policeman who wants to know way more than he should about your love life then he should be.At least Shin doesn't have to deal with all them right... right?!
