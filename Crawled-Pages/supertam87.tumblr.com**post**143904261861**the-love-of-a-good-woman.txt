                                                The Love of a Good Woman
                                                    This is an expansion of Jamie’s state of mind during the first 4 eps of season 2. FanFic Master ListIt had been months. His wounds were all but healed. His hand
was better than he had hoped it could be. His cock, on the other hand, had
betrayed him utterly. They had tried so many times. He had failed so many times. So
often he could not rise to the challenge, no matter how desperately he might
want to bed Claire. Other times he would find himself fiercely erect, burning
with want of her, yet as soon as he began, as soon as he relaxed into any sort
of intimacy with her, he was filled with disgust and shame so profound that he
would have to leave their bed for fear of being sick amongst the bedclothes. In the beginning he had tried to explain, but everything
seemed pathetic and futile so he stopped. She had fought with him and she had
cried. She had tried to talk him through it, tried to initiate intimacy. He had
rebuffed and rejected her as gently as possible. Sometimes it was because it
was too late, or because he had to get up too early, because he had important
papers he must attend to or because he felt ill. They both knew it was because
he feared the connection. He was aloof and withdrawn when he was with her in
their chamber and eventually she stopped crying, stopped fighting, stopped
asking for love and simply became silent. No reproach, no anger, no excitement.
Just – nothing. Tonight he had dreamed he was making love to his wife. She
was naked beneath him, holding him so close he could feel the press of her
breasts. Her legs wrapped enticingly around him, her skin burning where it
touched his. He felt a joy so profound he wanted to both weep and laugh as he
carried them to release…until, with unrelenting predictability, Randall
replaced Claire.He came awake abruptly, cock hard, balls aching, stomach churning
with bile. Claire, as always, tried to ease him through it. How could he tell
this beautiful creature that the sight and touch of her after a nightmare such
as this made him sick with self-loathing? He would never be a man again. This was the fifth night in a row he had awakened in the
dark, drenched in sweat, cursing his continued existence; five nights of wicked
dreams, five nights of pain, five nights of terror, five nights of rage. This
was the pattern of his nocturnal existence. Finally, he’d grow so weary from
lack of sleep that his body would simply collapse, and he’d sleep for a night, and
awake renewed and strengthened, only to begin the horrible process again within
a few days. Occasionally at first, and then with alarming regularity, he
would lose himself in drink, muddying his mind and blurring his thoughts. Even
then all he found was a haze of menace and unease; his rest was never
profitable. So many nights he would leave their bed, leave Claire, under the
pretense of work. There was much to
be done, and the Lord knew he was slow of hand. Frequently he did stay up,
struggling through the manifests and bills of lading, doing the work required
of him, lessening his anguish in the simple monotony of the wine business. But
just as many nights he was unable to focus on the work and found himself alone in
the alcove of their sitting room. He would lie under his plaid, seeking but not
finding, comfort in the weave of that familiar friend, wrestling with his
demons. Often he wept, despair overtaking his soul. Every part of him desired
Claire. Every muscle strained towards her, urging him to rise and return to
their bed, but he could not. He could not face lying next to her, feeling the
heat of her skin, smelling the faintly green scent that always floated about
her hair. He couldn’t bear to smell the musk of desire and arousal that drifted
from her secret places, filling his senses with promise, urging him to take
her, use her, rid himself of the fear and shame and loathing that were his
constant companions. He couldn’t bear to try and fail in a never-ending cycle
of humiliation.She was a stranger to him now. He no longer knew her body.
He felt distant from her mind. She was still Claire, but she was as separate
from him as any stranger had ever been. He screamed internally, desperate to
find a way to her. Every path was blocked by the black abyss filled with him, the demon who’d ended his life, but
hadn’t killed him. Damn Jack Randall to the black pits of hell forever. Damn
him!  The rage he felt was so consuming on some days that he could
barely maintain the most mundane conversations. His body and mind screamed at
him to maim, kill and crush. He needed to destroy that which had tried to
destroy, nay, which had destroyed
him. He needed to exact the justice of the Highlands, the justice of a warrior,
the justice of a man. But he was impotent. There was nowhere to direct his
rage. There was no Jack Randall to destroy, no bone to crush and flesh to tear
asunder. No fire to feed and stoke, to coax into a raging, burning apex of
fury, thence to be extinguished with the hot blood of his foe.  Jamie longed to slake his rage in the mindless oblivion of
blood lust. This was Randall’s greatest victory. He had taken Jamie’s body and
worse. He had taken Jamie’s manhood, his sense of self, his pride and his love of Claire and dragged it
through the filthy, fetid sewers of degradation and depravity. All of this
Jamie could have stood. All of it if, when he was given a second chance at
life, he had been given the opportunity to look that bastard in the eyes and
take it all back, sullied as it was, and know that it was his once again to
tend and cherish. All of this would have been naught, if he’d been given the
chance to watch the life drain out of Randall’s eyes and know himself to be avenged.
=====The night when she had bravely come to him again, waxed and
bare as a lass, he had been shocked, appalled even, but also terribly aroused.
He’d known that hoors did so at the brothels, but he’d had no notion that respectable
women did such a thing. And to have Claire, his beautiful brown one, in his
bed, as smooth and polished as wet river stone, had left him aching with need.
He had acted on instinct, claiming her mouth as he rolled onto her, pressing
hard. He’d come into her quickly and felt her immediate response. Lust surged
through his body, hot and urgent and he exulted in the heady cloud of pleasure
enveloping them. Quietly, sinisterly, from the dark places in his mind,
Jack’s tentacle reach coiled into his thoughts, reminding him of the pain he
was subjected to and the sweet relief he was given from that pain. The effect
was immediate. Confusion, embarrassment, shame. Always so much shame. Claire
tried to be understanding, as usual, but how could she understand this? She
knew the facts as they had occurred, but how could he explain the depths of
despair into which Jack had plunged him? How could he explain that he was drowning
in mist that dissipated as soon as he tried to grasp it? Oh, Claire! Beautiful,
brave Claire. How long could she be expected to stay in his bed, neglected and
forlorn? It would be different if he didn’t want her. If the sight of
her arse bent over the bed didn’t make his body ache and throb. If he could
look at her, lie in her bed, and feel nothing, then perhaps he could still be
some sort of husband to her. But he had never been able to look at her without
wanting her and now that want simply fed the shame that ate at him day after endless
day. How could he have her, take her body and touch her soul when his own soul
had become so defiled? Claire never tried again after that night. She no longer
initiated intimacy of any kind, and Jamie felt the loss keenly, but couldn’t
fault her when she had faced a constant stream of rejection month after long,
aching month. Would this hell never end?=====Dawn broke through the dark clouds of his mind the day
Claire told him that Jack Randall lived still. Randall was alive. He would meet
Jack Randall again and he would kill him. He would reclaim his manhood and
avenge the damage this demon had wreaked on his family. His father’s death,
Jenny’s disgrace, Claire’s assault, his own floggings and every second he had
spent at Wentworth. All of these things he would see Jack pay for with his
miserable, worthless life. This knowledge alone, sure and solid, was enough to
help him break free from his bindings. Now unbound, he had the strength to
begin his climb from the terrible dark pit where he had resided. He could see
the light of the sun and knew he had the ability to be whole once again. Jamie spent the day in good humor, and rushed home as
quickly as he was able, determined to prove to himself and his wife that his
shackles were broken, his mind and body free to act as he wished. Claire was
already in bed when he arrived, later than he had wished, and grateful to have
sent Charles off to his own abode. Comfortable living and free-flowing wine
were hardly a fair trade for the amount of time he had to spend in the company
of that wee fool.No, his life was still an unbearable hell. Jamie tried not
to think about anything, as he lay in the alcove, again, distanced from Claire once more by his own inability to
explain himself. There was so much between them now. So much pain, so much perceived
rejection. He didn’t begin to know how to bridge the gap. He wanted Claire. As
he’d once told her, he wanted her more than he’d ever wanted anything in his
life. He wanted to walk into their room and take her in his arms. Hold her and
soothe her. Love her and pay her court as she deserved. Tell her with is body
that she was still his everything. But he didn’t know how. Not anymore. He had
tried, in their room, to overcome the anxiety that surged through his system
when Claire had vocalized her hurt and fear. He couldn’t stay and face the
disappointment of another cold and lonely night, in bed together, so very much
alone. Jamie heard the soft swish of the panels rolling back on
their hinges, and caught the briefest glimpse of Claire as she dropped her
dressing gown. She was naked beneath and her skin glowed, luminous in the
moonlit room. She hushed him as she climbed onto the bed, silencing his hesitation,
removing the opportunity for doubt. She closed the doors and shut out the
world. It was dark in their little cavern, and the air was heavy with promise.
Jamie shut off his mind and reached out to Claire, reacquainting himself with
the peaks and valleys and secret places of her body. He worshiped her skin, caressing
the swell of her belly, the promise of his future, kissing and whispering words
of love as he made his way to her mouth. There was a moment, not long after their joining when he
felt the panic rise, felt his belly clench and everything started to freeze.
Claire felt it, too, and took Jamie’s face in her strong, capable hands, bringing
him in close for a soft, sweet kiss.“Jamie.” She breathed into his mouth, “Jamie, I’m here. Come
find me. Come find us.”His body was coursing with desire. The physical desire that
had never left, but had been ever frustrated, was easing as hands roamed freely
over Claire. His emotional desire, that yearning to connect with another soul that
had lain dormant for so long, was surging through him, piercing his heart,
resurrecting all the love and joy he had once known in his marriage, renewing
in him his faith in himself. He was free. At long last, he had overcome the
onslaught of the darkness, pushed it away, rejected it instead of his wife, and knew he could again. Claire had begun, taking Jamie to the places he feared to
go, keeping him with her until he overcame his doubt, always gentle, always
slow, allowing him to find his way. Now, joined with her in exquisite pleasure,
she stepped back and Jamie led them, confident in his body and his mind. He
wanted this moment to last forever. He wanted to be frozen in time with Claire,
joined, one, complete. He could not, however, contain his need to surrender to
her. He seized her, telling her with his hips that the time for gentleness had
passed. He pulled her on to him harder and deeper, biting her neck and
whispering roughly in her ear, “Mine, mo nighean donn, mine.”  They lay in each other’s arms, sheltered by the plaid that
had sheltered them so many times before. Jaime whispered to Claire all the
fears he had had, all the sorrows he had felt, all the ways he had felt alone,
sharing his heart and she returned the gift, cherishing him with her words.
They lay together, kissing, caressing, talking, reconnecting their souls, and
strengthening the bond that had been weakened, but never broken. Nothing
existed outside of themselves and this space. Jamie was ready to move on, his arsenal fully restored. He
was alive. He was whole. He was a man still and he could face the next fight,
whenever it might present itself, because of the love of a good woman.

Anyone who’s ever written a piece then taken the risk and posted it is doing something profoundly brave. They’re putting a part of themself, a piece of their imagination, out there to be seen. That deserves some acknowledgement. So the punctuation isn’t perfect. Maybe the grammar is shit. Cliches run amok. I don’t care. They took the leap and I applaud them for that.Everyone starts somewhere and no one ever gets better without practice. I’m in the business of trying to uplift people where I can and if there is one good thought, one good sentence, one neat idea they are getting a like.None of us are perfect. In a time when people are so mean and hateful to one another the offer of a small bit of kindness, even if it’s something as simple as the click of a button, can mean the world to someone and give them the encouragement they need.
