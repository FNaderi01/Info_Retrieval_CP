    Summary
      (OC x OIKAWA)“I’m resigning from the Volleyball Club.” Yana Iwaizumi used to love playing volleyball, but not anymore. She joined a team  as soon as she was old enough to play competitively. Unfortunately, for better or for worse they were always in the top three strongest schools.After a sudden school transfer to Aoba Johsai she vowed to never have anything to do with the Volleyball Club or it's incredibly popular captain and main setter, Oikawa. That's a little hard to do, especially when your cousin is the vice captain of the team and Oikawa's best friend.

    Summary
      (USHIJIMA X OC)They say that after making one thousand paper cranes you can make a wish and it will come true...---- Akiyama Umeko was a third year student at Shiratorizawa with one goal, to make one thousand paper cranes. This was her last year and she wanted to complete her goal. Umeko didn't really have much interest in anything other than the creative arts so it was only natural she didn't know much about volleyball. She had no reason to go to the gym, no reason to talk to the members of the club and certainly no reason to meet the captain of the team. However, a series of totally unplanned cliche events changed that.Soon she found herself very involved with the team and especially it's captain.
