    Summary
      (this fanfic is sort of related to the fanfic ‘Not Alone’ but it’s not necessary to read one to understand the other)Five years… Five years since you’ve heard from her… Your name is Rajani and you shouldn’t be in control of this body, though technically it is half yours. You are an extra personality and defenitly not the main one but after a traumatic event that happened five years ago the main personality, Miranda, has been comatose forcing you to remain in control of her/your body.So when you are hiking a mountain hoping that a few days camping might clear your head and you see a child about to jump into a deep cave with no security what so ever and you finally her Miranda’s voice telling you to save the child you don’t hesitate. … And then you fall into a world of monsters that want your soul to break a magical barrier that keeps then locked under the mountain. And with good reason, too. In this world is kill or be killed, after all… Oh you’ve got to be kidding me Miranda! How can we survive if we keep sparing the opponents?

    Summary
      When Miranda wakes up in the plane heading for the USA to meet her beloved sister she realizes that she had already lived that day before. It’s not just a sense of déjà vu, it is more than that. So much more… Who is this skeleton you can’t get out of your head and why do you feel so compelled to search for him and… WHY DO YOU FEEL ATTRACTED TO THE SKELETON!!!???
You’re going to get to the bottom of this!
(Series related to the fanfics ‘Not Alone’ and ‘Unbreakable’ but it isn’t necessary to read those to understand this one.)

    Summary
      So basically this will be a mix between an AU of Homestuck (in a way) where the extra John on this scene (see page and pester log) accidentally creates a new universe by zapping from place to place and time to time without control of his powers (see this Prologue for more on the subject). In this universe the Sburb and Sgrub games never get used and though the meteors still fall, there are duplicates of the Alpha kids and the Troll race shares the same universe with the humans because of zapping shenanigans. Also, underneath a mountain, monsters exist and, only by rescuing earth like That John did, will they get a chance to come to the surface (decided to use an AU for undertale too, this time Get-rammed's AU of Beastale) This will only show up like halfway through the fic so for now prepare to enjoy only troll and human shenanigans. Also, characters from a fan comic called Madstuck will show up. (see first page here)
