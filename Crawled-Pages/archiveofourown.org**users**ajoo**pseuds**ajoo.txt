      She embraces him so wholly she might be a manifestation of his artistic vision—crafted like a mosaic, a cathedral window—all extraneous pieces melted into stained glass, an abstraction of his deepest desires. Curated into a masterpiece of his own design to decorate the walls or wear as jewelry.

    Summary
      The brewing turf war between the Joestar and the Brando gangs has only made life harder for everyone trapped in between it all—including you. Money is tight and the cost of living only seems to get higher. Little did you know that your inability to pay the price of your monthly protection fee would change the course of your life forever.
