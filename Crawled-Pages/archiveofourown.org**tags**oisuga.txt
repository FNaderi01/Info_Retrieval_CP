    Summary
      Up and coming actor Tooru Oikawa is in the middle of filming before a storm hits and forces him and his crew to retreat into the hotel. Later that night when it seems as though the worst has passed, Oikawa just wants to move around and get a bite to eat. Unfortunately, as he's descending in the elevator, the power goes out and the elevator stops. He's trapped for a time with none other than Koushi Sugawara to keep him company.

    Summary
  Sugawara Koushi.
Oikawa’s brain supplies the name of the person standing at the other end of the aisle before Oikawa can even register him, attuned to spitting out facts about other volleyball players on a second’s notice, even after all these years. Karasuno High vice-captain. 174 cm…no, more like 176 now. Skilled at raising morale and bringing an element of surprise to their strategy. Troublesome. Refreshing. Setter.  The enemy.

      Bookmarker's Notes
        OH MY GOSH I’M IN TEARS,, i absolutely love every aspect of this fic that i don’t even know where to begin!! thank you for sharing this masterpiece okay okay first off, i love kageyama and oikawa’s interactions!! how he looks up to oikawa, how he’s enthralled by oikawa’s jump serve just like in canon ;; secondly i love the sweetness and fondness oikawa has for suga!! he’s so understanding gah and he fits so perfectly into their family,, i have too many lines that i adore but this one!! it makes me tear up qvq: “He sees his jacket, draped over the couch where he had forgotten it last night, his collection of volleyball game videos on the table next to the TV, his own crude drawing on the fridge next to Tobio’s. The man he loves in his arms. The boy he has come to adore sitting at the table, looking up at them shyly. And by the door, three sets of shoes in a row.”

    Summary
  "I win again," he declares triumphantly.
  "I'll get you next time," says Oikawa, smile tinged with the sharp tang of summer.
  It's no empty threat. Suga knows that he'll give it his very best, or kill himself trying, or, quite likely, kill them both. He's the worst. He's the best. (But, really, the worst, in the best way possible.)
how to meet and beat your perfect match, a manual: from back to front.

    Summary
      “You’re all bark and no bite, Tooru,” Koushi laughs, running a hand up Tooru’s chest and giving his nipple a particularly hard pinch.
You’re no bark and all bite, is what Tooru wants to say.  Instead, he chokes back a moan, and lets Koushi have his way with him.  He rides Tooru again, until Tooru is whimpering and begging Koushi to let him come inside again.  Koushi, for some reason, always obliges him.

    Summary
      Sugawara Koushi didn’t particularly hope to get into Seijoh - but now that he did manage to get in, he’s determined to make the best of it. This will be his new start and even though making his way into Seijoh’s volleyball team’s starting lineup won’t be an easy task, Suga refuses to give up without a fight.It doesn’t help that the one he’ll be going up against is Oikawa Tooru, Kitagawa Daiichi’s star setter and the best setter of the entire prefecture. And it definitely does not help that said setter is determined to drag Suga out of the misery his middle school team left him in by any and all means necessary and somehow manages to win his heart over in the process.

    Summary
  "He is not formed of the type of dust that makes up stars. Suga is not the type of person that stays in the mind of one like Oikawa Tooru, ten years later. He is formed of the type of dust you shake off, the type that settles into the ground." 
 Ten years after Suga last steps off a high-school court, Oikawa recollects a "Mr. Refreshing" in a post-game interview, and Suga is left scrambling.

    Summary
      Oikawa has moved back to Japan after a hearbreak, after his seven year long relationship ended, and he moves into an aparment with six other people. The most dysfuntional people he has ever met (and he thought he was a mess!).So, with the failures of citizens that he also calls 'roommates', a little begrudgingly, he tries to gather the pieces of his shattered heart and confidence. 
On his first day in the new apartment he is warned to stay away from Suga, the name provoking so little to be scared of he dismisses it, meets a stranger, and accidentally makes a merciless mistake.He didn't mean to fall in love when he realized who he was warned to stay away from.But feelings don't listen to your head.
