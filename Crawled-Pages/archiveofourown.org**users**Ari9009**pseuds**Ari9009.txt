    Summary
      The engine of Stiles’ old beat-up Jeep sputtered and rattled as it pulled into the driveway of the Stilinski house, and for the first time in three years, Derek and Stiles were home. Not that Beacon Hills was home. The town was nothing more than a swath territory that they had both sacrificed, bled, and nearly died for.The land, however, was another matter.--(Or: Stiles and Derek come home, and things aren't quite what they appear.)
