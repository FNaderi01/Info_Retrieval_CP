    Summary
      Luz and Amity were prone to a lot of fights. Both in public and when it was just the two of them. There was no rhyme or reason to it. One moment they were having a regular day and the next they had bloody hands and blurry vision.And yet, Luz still tried to have a little humanity every once in a while.Aka, beta concepts of Luz &amp; Amity fight in a parking lot and are soft.

    Summary
      Due to a Huge Misunderstanding when they first meet, Crowley spends the next six thousand years thinking Aziraphale is a demon, and Aziraphale thinks Crowley is an angel.  By the time they figure out the truth, they've only got eleven years left until the end of the world.
Alternately, the one where Aziraphale and Crowley are enemies, but neither of them ever got the memo.

    No Archive Warnings ApplyDiana Cavendish/Atsuko "Akko" KagariAtsuko "Akko" Kagari Diana CavendishKissing Making Out that's pretty much it Sorry Not Sorry Fluff Established Relationship So Diana is used to Akko by now Mild Sexual Content
    Summary
      It was several minutes into the lesson when Diana walked in, dishevelled, her hair and uniform a mess and a red tint on her cheeks."I apologise, Professor, I was doing something foolish."Minutes later, Akko arrived at the door in a similar manner, although grinning sheepishly."I just did something really clever!"¬†Diana has broom practise while Akko has magic linguistics class and Akko would rather watch her girlfriend getting changed than listen to Finnelan's lesson. Not to say that Akko only watched.(lots of kissing and not very much else)
