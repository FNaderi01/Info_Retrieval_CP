                                                                        laythornmuse
                                                                        Claire’s feet carried her quickly from Alistair’s study, but a set of boots followed her.  Claire maneuvered swiftly through the crowded halls where servants and soldiers searched for beds for the night and ascended the stairs to her own chamber.  At the top of the stairs, the pursuing boots spoke.“Claire,” James called.  “A word?”Claire froze but did not answer.  She’d held her composure to the eyes that watched her, but with solitude just footsteps away, she felt her willpower waiver. She turned towards his voice and nodded her consent. She did not trust her voice just yet.“You’ve had a shock, I know, but—”“Do not attempt to tell me what I feel, sir.” Claire spat, her eyes glassy with rage and tears.James held his hands upward, taking a step closer to her. “I mean no offense, Claire.  I know regret too well and wish to spare you the pain of it.”Claire felt herself take a step back but then grounded her feet.  She was exhausted, hurt, and on the verge of unraveling in front of a man she barely knew. Even Alistair had only seen her tears once.“I can barely look at him,” she whispered.  “I’m furious that he was…that he could even…” Claire wiped at her cheek again and scowled as her face tightened with frustration.   “What did you want to tell me?”James pressed his lips together as he watched her face close off, cloud over, and grey. “That you should go to him, and spend these last hours with him.  The anger lasts, but the hours do not.”“He’s your enemy!” She exclaimed,  and then quickly hugged her arms to her chest. She swallowed hard and lowered her voice.  “Why would you care for his welfare or mine?”“He is not my enemy, not now that I have the truth from him,” James said steadily, taking another step towards her.  He cautiously extended his hands to her elbows and took hold of her gently.  “He has chosen his path of atonement, and if it’s suitable for God, then it’s suitable for me.” He paused then and took her in.  Her eyes blazed with courage, and she stood ready to accept whatever fate awaited her.  Did she think he’d throw her in the dungeon then?  The fierce scowl curling about her lips told him she’d thought of it.“Do you fear you’re marrying the crazed beast, then?”  Claire felt a blush creep up her neck at his words.  “Oh. You’ve heard of your reputation.”“Mmhm.  Drinker of traitor’s blood, and stalker of oath-breakers, or that’s the last I heard,” James said and raised a brow.  “Any others?”“A few.  What’s your point?” Claire countered.James shot her a small grin,  and Claire felt her cheeks tingle in response.“Any decent man would care about his future wife’s welfare,” James said and dropped his hands from her arms.  “Unless you plan to reject my offer.”“Is it an offer?” Claire asked tartly. “Can I truly say no without being destitute?”“I’d like to say I could arrange it, but I won’t be able to control my uncle once I’m gone.”“And why me then?  Guilt?” Claire asked, letting her eyes wander to the floor.  “Your ability to outmaneuver marriage arrangements is sung about as much as your battles.”James laughed then, a hearty sound that sent warmth down to her toes. His face lightened, and he appeared as a boy for a moment before he bit his bottom lip. “Well, I admit I have several reasons.  Will you settle for the most practical one?”Claire considered him for a moment.  “I can admire practicality, yes.”James nodded.  “My son has bouts of sickness, and I have a suspicion you’d find a way to help him.”  Claire watched his fingers tap against his thigh.  “He also needs a mother.  I fear I’ve denied him one his entire life, and he’s finally old enough to notice. I suppose if you accept me,  you accept him as well.”Claire nodded at his words and met his eyes. “His name?”“Brian James.”Claire cast her eyes down.  “You’re father must have been proud.”James nodded.  “He was.”Claire felt the resolution settle in her, as well as a semblance of peace, the first she’d felt since the castle’s surrender. “I’ll accept you both, and I’ll take heed of your advice.  I’ll change and then go to Alistair.”James bowed his head and felt relief wash over him at her words.  He turned to leave when she called out to him once more.Claire bit her lip and steadied herself.  “Will it be quick? His death?”James felt his chest tighten and nodded.  “He’s requested a duel with swords, but I’ll make sure it’s clean and swift.”A tear slid down Claire’s cheek as she gripped her elbows to her chest. “Thank you.”“My lady.”***Claire found herself standing by his graveside at dawn,  not having slept a single hour.  A heavy fog crept slowly along the stacked stone walls, making the rock shimmer with condensation. Her uncle’s stone was small but well kept, a sign of the lives he touched during his years here as a tutor. Jacob’s stone was by the willow tree, beside his mother’s.  Alistair’s plot would surely be on her opposite side.“Jacob.”  His name sounded too loud in the thick morning fog.She swallowed and tucked her hands into her knitted shawl.  “You told me one day I would marry and find happiness…”  She squeezed her eyes shut.  “But I did not imagine it like this.”Claire sat on the willow’s exposed root,  huddling into its side as her eyes swept over the grounds.  “I remember when we used to play here.  We had picnics under these trees and annoyed the piss out of the spirits with our loud games.”  A soft breeze moved through her curls, and she closed her eyes as a smile lighted her face.“You were my brew taster, my weed picker, my secret keeper…” Her smile grew.  “Still are, I suppose.” Claire fell silent and let the early sun rays break through the fog and light her face. A stillness settled within her.“Thank you,” she whispered to the last traces of fog and wiped the stray tear off her cheek.  She stood and shook out her skirts, giving the graveyard one last glance before she started back toward the castle. She wouldn’t sleep,  but she would be by Alistair’s side until fate parted them.  ***A quarter to Noon, Alistair walked Claire down the stairwell to the small family chapel.  Claire froze at the bottom of the stairs when she heard James’ voice.  Alistair turned to her, a ghost of a smile on his face.“I know you harbor anger for me despite your silence,” he said softly. “But I am grateful I can see you safe.”  Claire nodded stiffly and gave him a tight smile before lifting her skirts and continuing forward.James stood by the chapel doors with Dougal, looking like a fine specimen of a man in his shined boots and gentleman’s coat.  His kilt was pressed and clean,  a miracle considering the chaos of the last few days, and his hair was tied at the nape of his neck. When his eyes swept over her, she became self-conscious. While her dress was clean, it was hardly one of her best.James walked towards her and bent over her hand to press a kiss to her knuckles.  He met her eyes and gave her hand a reassuring squeeze. If he had an opinion of her appearance, he didn’t show it.“Ready?” He asked softly.Claire nodded as he led her into the chapel, with Alistair and Dougal in tow.Claire felt her heart race as the priest began the ceremony.  James kept a firm hold of her elbow as he spoke his vows, though she wasn’t sure if he meant to hold her up or keep her from fleeing.When James produced a gold band from his pocket, she nearly pulled her hand away in shock.  It fit her finger well, but the extravagance of a gold band on a second arranged marriage was not lost to her.Before Claire could look up, the priest announced them married, and Claire raised her head in time to feel the gentle graze of James’ lips on hers. She felt flush as his kiss sent heat down her spine and heard herself gasp when he suddenly pulled away.A moment later, she realized why: Dougal stormed out of the chapel and immediately put Alistair in shackles.“Dougal,” James called harshly.“Nay, Jamie, we’ve done enough of this your way, aye?”  Dougal answered as he hauled Alistair behind him up the stairs to the courtyard.  Claire stood frozen at the chapel doors as she watched James bound up the stairs after Dougal. For a brief moment, she considered if she should try to run,  but that thought left her head when she heard the angry clash of steel and a roar of shouts.Claire felt herself fall against the steps as she tripped on her skirts but barely registered the pain as the shouts grew louder.  Finally reaching the upper courtyard, Claire let out a scream as Dougal plunged his dagger into Alistair’s eye before kicking him to the ground.His howls and screams were needles in her skin, and without thinking, she lunged for the circle of men and pushed her way through.  Right before she broke through the crowd,  James rushed forward and knocked Dougal backward.  With his dagger drawn, he quickly dealt a mortal wound that left Alistair silent.Claire pulled away from the men and slowly approached Alistair’s battered form,  taking his hand as she knelt beside him.  James pressed his hand to Alistair’s forehead and began whispering what Claire recognized as a prayer. Slowly, Alistair slipped away from her,  his grip on her hand growing weaker and weaker.“Rest well…son of Scotland,” James whispered.

It was, at times, uncomfortable and awkward,  sweaty with noises that in any other environment, would be frankly, horrendous. To find someone that you were comfortable with, and perhaps not just comfortable, but more importantly compatible with was rare.Claire had had sex with men before. She could count on one hand the times that it had been absolutely mind blowing (one of those times had been on hers and Jamie’s first date- once the cherry had been popped and Jamie became more sure of what he was doing) and she had lost count of the amount of times she had faked it in order to have the session end. She didn’t like faking it- didn’t like lying about it, but sometimes it was a necessary measure. Some men tried too hard, were too much in their own mind that they lost the rhythm of things and made Claire, in turn, lose interest. Others didn’t try at all, laying there like a limp noodle expecting Claire to do all the work. A few had clearly watched far too many porno’s written by a man, where the woman was immediately ready after a kiss on the lips and a squeeze of a breast. One in particular should perhaps do some research on the female anatomy.The lead up to sex could be awkward. Of course, there were plenty of times where one thing led to another and two people would end up in bed together. But others, not so much. To go for it, to hold back, did the other person want this, was it too soon- there were far too many variable factors. It felt odd to just blurt out “well, should we have sex now?”. There was a certain trepidation with the lead up to sex, and suggesting it. What if the other person wasn’t ready? What if it was too soon? Things with Jamie on their first date had happened organically, and sure it was awkward and there were moments that were stiff and graceless. But after the bandaid had been well and truly ripped off and Claire let herself go with him, he seemed to be a natural and Claire hadn’t been able to stop thinking about it. They fit together, and yes, there were leg cramps, elbows in the wrong place and a few moments of passion that were broken by an unexpected move, but they had found each other on an intimate level that Claire wasn’t entirely sure she had experienced with another partner before.Her first sexual experience had been memorable, but not in the way one would want it to be. Fumbling hands, red faced blushing profusely, a few strokes and it was over. It was a classic first time between her and her then boyfriend. She’d thought a few times over the weeks between her and Jamie’s first date, that Jamie didn’t know how good he’d had it for his first time.She’d rarely had a reaction to another man like she did with Jamie. Other men would put their hands on her knee or hold her hand and she would think, ‘I suppose this is nice’. But when Jamie touched her, she was sure that her entire surface area broke out in gooseflesh. Perhaps it was the distance between them, the uncertainty of what they were or how they were supposed to be together that made her react that way. But even after they had defined what they were to each other, his touch still gave her the same reaction.  Keep reading

Enter one Claire Elizabeth Beauchamp (Randall?) to this story) @outlanderpromptexchange​Chapter 1: Life offers you many surprisesBerlin, Französische StraßeFriday, 25 July 2025, 8.50 a.m.         Five minutes earlier, Claire Elisabeth Beauchamp had entered the large, light gray house, built in the neo-Renaissance style that dominated the whole Forum Fridericianum. In the lobby, which was dominated by marble and dark wood, Claire was greeted by a receptionist. She was asked to sit down for a moment in one of the dark leather armchairs, of which four were grouped around an elegant round table. As she waited, her eyes wandered up the high walls of the entrance hall. A few steps of a staircase led out of the hall through a large glass door that ended in a round arch at the top, reminiscent of a gate entrance. Above it was a large ornament of dark stones inlaid in the light marble. The ornament showed a circle, which, as it seemed, was formed from a belt. The words “Je suis prest” could be read in the curve of the circle and in the center of the ornament was the head of a stately stag, which looked directly at the observer. Keep reading

                                                Our Story: Chapter 7
                                                    Hi friends! Sorry for the delay here. I’ve been on vacation, so my priorities have been boozin’ and cruisin’. Thanks for your continued support of this story—I love hearing your feedback. This one’s a whopper of a chapter!______We often lose track of time in this great, big world of ours, in much the same way we lose a pair of keys, a couple of pens. “I swear I saw them two seconds ago!” we groan, groping to purse-bottoms, finding only lint and chump-change. So many things—these small facets of our lives—sucked into the void of bygones, taken before we can ever think to tie them down.“I swear I was twenty-two just yesterday.”This is how it is for Jamie and Claire, their years like old playbills confiscated by the wind and an invisible clock. Certain acts reappear from time to time, when the arm of a broom sweeps them into the light, when the frosting of dust disturbs, then floats. And for a brief moment, as the particles of time and forget resettle themselves, Jamie and Claire can hear their lives’ most glorious crescendos. The lowest notes tip-toe from the long-kept silence, rising and sinking slowly, steadily. All plucked strings, still vibrating, until the echoes die, cradling the past.You can write an entire story with these bits and pieces of their lives, cut the acts together to form one winding opera. It plays and stops until, eventually, the grand finale. The overlap: a perfect harmony which carries them from their separate wings, to center stage and to each other. And it is there, finally, that they meet again, lips and lives melding. They stand together in the orb of the spotlight. A single sun, glowing.Keep reading

                                                The Berserker - Part 21
                                                                        suhailauniverse
                                                                        - MasterlistPart 21. “Again.”Claire could barely lift her arms, but with wooden sword in one hand and shield in the other, she straightened up once more and took her position.Elin, armed the same, came at her with a fluidity that defied her age. She carried her weapons as if they weighed nothing and struck with a graceful yet deceptive turn of strength that Claire still couldn’t quite believe. Claire could definitely see where Jamie got his ferocious agility from.Elin brought her sword down on Claire from above - Claire just barely getting her shield up in time to parry - then spun round, bringing the edge of her shield just inches shy of Claire’s exposed midriff.“Yer shield is as much a weapon as yer sword and yer sword as much a shield,” Elin said for what felt like the millionth time. “It is more than just an extension of yer hands, they must both feel as light as each other. Here,” Elin said, moving to stand beside Claire and showing her a particular spinning maneuver Claire couldn’t quite seem to master. “The moment ye have yer shield raised to parry the blow, ye leave yer belly unprotected. Ye canna afford to ever leave it unprotected. Ye must anticipate yer next move before yer shield has even left yer side.”Elin, in one agile movement, raised her shield above her head and brought the flat of her sword -  blade pointing down - to safeguard her abdomen, then spun away to her left with one step which - if done properly - effectively put her behind her now vulnerable and stumbling opponent.“‘Tis all in the feet, Claire, and using yer opponent’s strength and momentum against them, as much as using yer own,” she finished, with her hands resting on her hips.Taking a deep breath and rotating her shoulders to loosen the settling tightness, Claire went through the motions once more. She seemed to finally be grasping the blocks, but it was the spin away that always left her off balance. Off balance enough that any split second advantage she would have gained to go on the offensive was lost.“Uuuugh!” Claire groaned in frustration after a few more attempts. Of all the lessons she’d had with Elin so far, this had by far been the most disheartening. They had been at it everyday for two weeks now. In amongst all the preparations taking place around them, Elin had pulled Claire aside for a few hours to work on different techniques Claire never knew were even possible. She never thought she’d ever find herself being able to move like that. She knew she was nowhere near Elin’s (or any of the other shieldmaidens there) level, but there was so much she still wanted to learn. Seeing them all spar in what free time they got was a sight to behold.Just then, Jamie came around the corner, tunelessly humming to himself, eating a dried piece of venison. Whenever he got the chance, he loved to come and watch the two of them spar. He sat on an upturned barrel and quietly munched on his snack as Elin repeated the move.“Once yer body gets used to the motion,” Elin was saying patiently, “it will become second nature. A movement that will open more doors to others.”Claire wondered if perhaps such moves came easier to those that weren’t pregnant. She felt ungainly as it was, so executing something with precision seemed rather counterproductive. Elin read her look all too quickly.“We learn these actions precisely because we carry far more prized treasures than men do,” she said patiently. Claire tried again, without much success.“Dinna tighten yer hips so much, Sassenach,” Jamie chimed in from his perch.“Oh yeah,” she replied testily, “why don’t you show me how it is done then, since you know so much.”He hopped off the barrel good naturedly, took her sword and shield and taking up a position in front of Elin - who came at him without warning at a ferocious speed - proceeded to pull off the move swiftly and with very little effort. He turned to Claire and bowed.“Damn…” she said.“Dinna feel defeated, lass,” Elin said, consolingly, “he’s been training since he was a wee lad. Here,” she added, giving Claire her weapons, “spar with him for a bit. ‘Tis always better to train with a bigger opponent.”Jamie was always hesitant to spar with Claire while she was pregnant, and had adamantly refused the first time Elin had told him to. But after much convincing and coaxing from Claire, he finally reluctantly agreed.He took up his place in front of Claire, rotated his shoulder a few times, then at Elin’s word, proceeded to bring his sword down on Claire in the slowest, gentlest possible way. So slow in fact, Claire had time to straighten up from her crouched position and put her hands on her hips, exasperated.“Every time,” she said, swatting his sword away irritably when it finally reached her, unable to keep her smile at bay as Jamie - who Claire had come to find was unable to wink properly - blinked at her like a solemn owl. She winked back.“Properly, lad, she needs to learn,” Elin said, stifling her own amusement.So with a resigned sigh, Jamie swung - with speed but considerably less power than he truly possessed - and they began to spar in earnest. They went to and fro with barely a pause, working different techniques as Elin shouted out instructions and advice from time to time. Jamie was pleased to see Claire’s style begin to evolve for the better since she began training with his mother. Her response time as well had improved greatly. “Now!” Elin suddenly yelled in the middle of one of Jamie’s feints.He suddenly spun and brought down his sword. Claire, having no time to breath let alone to think, let her body move of its own accord. She parried with her shield, blocked his own with the flat of her sword and with a rather inelegant but effective pirouette, she spun around him and satisfyingly tapped his behind with her sword.“Finally!” she exclaimed, raising her hands in triumph, then immediately lowered them as if they were made of stone. Jamie rubbed his behind in mock consternation.“Well done, a leannan,” Elin said, applauding. “Always best not to overthink it. Ye kent what to do fine, ye just got caught up in the technique of it all. Best to just let yer body guide ye through. Again.”“Ma,” Jamie said, giving her beseeching look, “she can barely lift her arms, perhaps a break for today?”Claire kept silent, not wanting to seem weak or exhausted, but was secretly relieved and thankful he’d spoken up.“Aye,” Elin said, looking at Claire’s now limp arms, “aye, yer right. That’s enough for today. I hope ye arena overly tired, lass?”“No,” Claire lied immediately. “But I think I need to check on the stores for my herbs.”Elin smiled and nodded. “I’ll leave ye two to it, then. Where’s yer godfather, Jamie? I have some things to discuss with him.”“I left him in the stables,” he replied.With that, Elin bid them goodbye and headed to the stables. As soon as she was out of sight, Claire dropped her weapons and doubled over.“Lord, but I am exhausted!” she said, near breathless.Jamie laughed and walked around her and began kneading her shoulders.“Ye did braw, mo cridh,” he said, kissing her neck. “D’ye need me to carry ye inside, or do ye think you can manage?” he teased.She playful slapped his thigh. “No, I can manage,” she said, turning in his arms and wrapping her own around his waist.They walked back to the main house in good spirits, Jamie keeping tight hold of Claire’s sagging body.***Lallybroch had begun to look like a veritable fortress. Jamie had made sure to oversee every aspect of their preparations, his directions adding far more to what had already been done. A fence made of tall, spiked wooden beams - with ramparts erected along the inner wall for the archers - encircled the entire boundary of the freehold. In addition to the main palisade, formidable spiked beams and tenails jutted out of the wall at irregular intervals, making scaling it near impossible, and a deep trench was dug into the ground all round the foot of the outside wall. The outer grounds themselves had been roughly furrowed making it thoroughly uneven, on top of the crude chevaux de frise that had been scattered throughout the landscape per Jamie’s command.He had been determined to make sure storming Lallybroch would be next to impossible. Claire stood beside him on one of the ramparts watching the men and women train on the uneven ground.“This willna be the main battle ground,” Jamie said quietly, as the winter wind whipped around them. Claire knew he had chosen the narrow mountain pass Dufgall would have to use to get to Lallybroch, where to meet his uncle. “Should he pass us, he willna have an easy time getting to Lallybroch.”“Why leave the safety of the walls, at all?” Claire asked looking over at him, his face creased in deep thought as if etched in stone. “Why not just meet him here?”He looked at her then. “I willna have him anywhere near ye, mo nighean donn,” he said, voice softening.“Claire is right, my lad,” Elin’s voice came from behind them. She walked towards them, Murtagh by her side. “Our fortification here can repel any attack.”“And all it would take is one fire arrow to bring it all down,” Jamie retorted.“Aye, that is true,” Murtagh said, “but he willna be expecting to be lured into that,” he said, gesturing to the pock-marked ground before them. “We have the advantage of the higher ground here.”Jamie nodded vaguely. “‘Tis a thought…” he said.“I sent Willie, our fastest lad, to keep a lookout beyond Broch Mordha. Should Dufgall’s force be seen, we’ll ken it soon enough,” Murtagh said.“Aye,” Elin said, sighing, “we have done all we can to prepare ourselves, but now we must see to more pressing matters. Getting through the winter as strongly as possible. It willna help matters much if we neglect our life here. Those new to this land need to be reminded what it is they fight for. What they may die for to defend.”Claire shivered at the impending prospect and wrapped her thick woolen cloak around more tightly. But Elin was right. No matter what may happen, they had to live first.***Life at Lallybroch slowly returned to normal. As it got colder, it was easy to see people retreat into their own confined family bubbles, but Jamie had taken it upon himself to make sure the inhabitants didn’t. Every night, in the makeshift long house they’d initially built when first they’d returned, they held a communal gathering. They ate and drank and got to know each other properly. The last remaining barriers between the Norsemen and the Scots finally falling away. An amalgam of languages (and cultures) coming together to create a unique pidgin - much to Lamb’s delight.Claire’s morning sickness however, had yet not improved since leaving Jenny and Ian’s.“Bread,” she murmured, near every morning. “Bread,” she said, more urgently.She heard Jamie clamber out of their bed, bare feet thumping onto the wooden floor and scrambling as he cursed in Gaidhlig, looking for the loaf he’d brought with him the night before.“Here,” he said nervously and she could smell the piece he’d brought to her lips. She cracked an eye open, looking from him to the bread, then heaved herself onto her elbow, gingerly taking a small bite. She tentatively chewed.“Better?” he asked, kneeling beside her. She nodded as the bread helped her roiling stomach a bit.“You’re naked,” she observed, looking him up and down and giving his bare chest a poke.“Aye and whose fault is that?” he said amused. Their night had been a breathless and feverish taking. Neither patient enough for tenderness, too hungry for one another to take stock of where or even how they’d flung off each other’s clothes. “It is freezing, Jamie, you should put something on,” she said, lying back down and shutting her eyes, willing her stomach to settle.He laughed and got back under the covers beside her and pulled her to him. “Aye, I would, but yer wearing my shirt,” he said nuzzling into her neck. “Are ye alright?” he asked quietly.“I’ll be fine in a moment,” she replied, slipping her hand beneath the covers and giving his leg a reassuring squeeze. “What have you planned for today?” she asked, stifling a yawn.“Och,” he said, rubbing her arm, “nay much really, just helping with the remaining preparations for Hogmanay.”With the new year fast approaching and having lived among them for so long, Jamie had been well versed in Norseman winter solstice customs, but looked forward to sharing the customs of his own land he hadn’t openly celebrated since he was a young boy.The twelve day Jol winter feast celebrations were already well under way. What trees that hadn’t been taken by the frost had been decorated with carvings and food, a couple having been cut down and brought into the shared longhouse, while the Jol log had already been burning for a dozen days. Panpipes, tagelharpas and lyres permeated through the still nights spent in the longhouse, punctuated by the hypnotic thrum of drums and the stomping of feet. Haunting voices carried through the pulsating and primal celebrations. Sometimes lasting until first light.Uncle Lamb had told Claire stories of the winter solstice customs held here in the North during their long travels, but they had never had the chance to experience them. And seeing Jamie’s quiet excitement at the prospect of getting to have a proper Hogmanay at home was infectious. He had placed a lump of coal by their bedroom hearth, while Elin had been busy baking black bun cakes for days - though given the frigid winter they were having, the cakes weren’t as rich in fruit as they usually would have been.Eager to participate, Lamb had shadowed Elin for most days, asking questions and trying his hand at baking - to disastrous results. Finally tired of his endless fervor, Elin had suggested he and Murtagh, being of black hair, be in charge of the first-footing duties, while Elin and Jamie would handle the saining.“Saining?” Claire asked, twining her fingers with his and nestling deeper into his warm embrace.“A blessing. Of the house and livestock and such,” he replied, tucking a stray curl behind her ear with his free hand. “‘Tis seen as bad luck for red headed folk to participate in the first footing, see, so we tend to keep out of sight during, busying ourselves with other things.”“Bad luck, is it? I would say I have had rather the most agreeable luck with red heads,” Claire said coyly.“Agreeable, huh?” Jamie said, his hand slowly, lightly working its way beneath her shirt and up her bare leg.“Most agreeable,” she replied, turning slightly towards him, giving his touch more access. She took a sharp intake of breath as his nimble, yet slightly cold fingers reached their destination. “And so what will I be doing, during all of this?” she asked between breathless gasps.“Ye could put yer feet up by the fire? Have a dram?” At the sour look on her face - she had lost all taste for whisky the further into her pregnancy she had gotten - he quickly said, “or mayhaps ye could help me with the saining?”“And what exactly does a saining entail?”“Och,” he said, settling into his self-appointed task. “I just need to go up to the wee river ford just north of here and get a few pails of water. Then find what juniper branches I can and bring those back as well.”“Why?”“Well, the juniper branches we burn throughout the homestead to stave off evil spirits. The water we drink a little of, before sprinkling that too throughout the homestead and livestock. The water’s said to be magic, crossed by both the living and the dead.”At this, Claire’s half closed eyes snapped open abruptly. “What?”“‘Tis nay but old custom and tradition, Sassenach,” he replied with a bit of a laugh. “Come with me today. Ye can sit in the wagon while I go about my work?”The prospect of spending the day with Jamie, albeit in the frigid cold, sounded far more pleasant than training in the frigid cold with Elin. She nodded eagerly but almost immediately dropped her head back onto the pillow, letting out a long, drawn out moan as Jamie’s fingers utterly undid her altogether.***

                                                EDINBURGH TO BOSTON -CHAPTER 20 - PERMANENCE
                                                    Edinburgh to BostonChapter 20PermanenceHello all, Here is chapter 20 of Edinburgh to Boston. There are several things that you need to know when you read this. It begins directly after the King’s Gambit. In fact it is the same day. We pick up after Jamie teased Claire in bed. The chapter encompasses several days. It starts on a Tuesday and ends on Sunday night before they return to work on Monday morning. There is some concern that readers could get lost because of the changing days, so I just labeled each section with the day of the week for convenience.I want to thank scubalass as always for her work as the beta, which is not an easy task. I can be pigheaded at times.I give you Edinburgh to Boston, Chapter 20, Permanence. For better or worse, here goes nothing.Tuesday afternoon:“Come here mo chridhe, ” he beamed holding open his arms to her.Claire eyed him suspiciously, “What are you planning to do?”“I want tae kiss ye, ” he chuckled.“Oh no, you don’t. You’re not going to get me all riled up again and not finish the job. I’m no fool you know.”“Never thought ye were. I just thought we could start at the beginning and see where it takes us,” he proposed as he wiggled his eyebrows suggestively. “Sound like a plan?”Claire launched herself into his arms, ”Aye, that sounds wonderful.”They were entwined in each other’s arms luxuriating in the closeness. He stroked her with a practiced hand. Caressing her. Adoring her.  Whispering words of love in her ear.  They kissed and ignited an inferno. They burned bright and hot becoming blazing twin suns. He moved over her covering her body, He wanted to possess her body and soul. “Ye are mine, Sassenach. Now and forever. Body and soul. Whether ye will it or no’. Mine.”“Yours,” she whimpered.And loved her tenderly, then furiously until they were sated and sleepy.Claire yawned contentedly, “I never knew playing chess could make you so tired.” Jamie chuckled, “‘Tis a verra rigorous game.” He pulled her against his chest wrapping his arms around her. They closed their eyes and  fell into a blissful sleep.Keep reading

                                                Our Story: Chapter 5
                                                                        westerhos

The going is treacherous in these parts—the wayward couple must heal on their own, tread the sea of two decades with arms and souls akimbo—but still, it is not unnecessary. The middle is never aimless. Always, always, it has one goal: the ending.When the lights go up and the curtains close, you clap—perhaps, should the couple reunite (which, of course, they will), you shout “Encore, encore!” But then, at last, you return to your car. You catch the train, or you grab a taxi. At last, having started at the beginning and waded through the middle, you reach the final destination. The night is over; you go home.Home. Whether a place, a person, a feeling, or a thing—it does not matter. Home is always the goal and the ending, the northernmost star we pray to and walk towards.[December 24th, 1996] Keep reading

It was lovely to see how the NTS have sorted the access and made everything tidy. (My clan)This is the marker for the Clan chief mentioned by DG in The Fiery Cross where Lieutenant Hayes mentioned how Jamie rescued him from Murchison and took him to the well where this chief was being tended (although already dead).Old Leanach Cottage on Culloden Battlefield in Scotland is Believed to be The Only Remaining Building From the Battle in 1746We drove down Strathdon to see the unique Corgarff Castle, once a family Tower House and, after Culloden, taken over by the Redcoats, fortified and garrisoned, to oppress the Highlanders.
