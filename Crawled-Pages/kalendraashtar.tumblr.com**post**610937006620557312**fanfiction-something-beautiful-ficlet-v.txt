                            Fanfiction - Something Beautiful (Ficlet V)
                            This ficlet is a much deserved belated birthday present to the ever lovely @missclairebelle​. I love you loads, K! A heartfelt thank you to @veryfaintveryhuman​, whose recent comment on the last chapter of SB moved me to write again in this universe (that is the great power of generosity). This ficlet takes place immediately after Jamie and Claire’s wedding (honeymoon ficlet, y’all!!) and I hope you enjoy it. Let me know if you have other requests! XSomething Beautiful Arc I, Something Beautiful Arc IIFiclet I, Ficlet II, Ficlet III, Ficlet IVSomething BeautifulFiclet V – Half a MoonAfter
nineteen hours of traveling in commercial airplanes - including three layovers
(Aberdeen – Glasgow – Amsterdam – Abu Dhabi – Malé) -, followed by a
bumpy, sweaty and slightly terrifying trip on a light aircraft (a matchbox
for flying humans) and speed boat, it was hardly surprising that Jamie and
I kissed chastely on the lips before collapsing on the enormous bed of our
Maldivian honeymoon suite. Exhaustion had a way of knocking out sexiness, and
we had two weeks to enjoy being naked together in the sultry air. But my
slumber must have recognized the lingering tension of my body and the
expectations created by being a newly-married woman – amidst chaotic dreams of
bland airplane meals, arguments on the baggage claim desk and the immensity of
crushing blue surrounding me, I fantasized of being woken by the mouth of my
husband upon me and arriving at the lavish breakfast well loved. Thus, it was
somewhat disappointing when I opened my eyes to discover the plush pillow next
to mine empty of my favourite red mane. A note scribbled in Jamie’s jumbled
penmanship read “Went for a morning jog. Meet me at the beach, Mrs. Fraser?”I turned the
note several times on my hand, perplexed, half-expecting to find a “Got you,
Sassenach – meet me in the shower!”, but upon uncovering nothing else had
to admit defeat and drag my mildly annoyed arse to put on a bathing suit. Critically
examining my reflection over my shoulder, clad in a shiraz-red trikini, I
decided it was probably enough to ensure little time in public and our swift
return to our water villa. Carrying my light
beach bag and my straw sun hat, I padded across the long walkway which
connected the secluded water villas to the shore, where the main activities of
the resort were located. Before too long, I was settled on a sun lounger, thoroughly
smeared with fragrant sunscreen, like a buttered pale chicken ready to roast. It was still
fairly early, and my head was filled with a jetlag haze that made everything
watery and somewhat strange, so I napped on and off under the balmy influence
of the Maldivian sun as I waited for Jamie to return. Soon it became too hot (a
trickle of sweat defying my bellybutton in a nagging race) and I ventured
into the absurdly clear waters, discovering they were a far cry from the briskness
of Aberdeen’s ocean, like a liquid soup enriched by colourful schools of reef fishes
and corals. Lounging on
my chair again to dry, I noticed a couple of indiscreet young women giggling openly
near the beach bar, as they threw inquisitive and lewd glances towards
something on the far left. It was without any great surprise (but a definite
hint of pride and possessiveness) that I turned my head to realize Jamie
was running towards us. His flaming hair
was moist, subdued to roan and cinnabar, either from exertion or an impromptu
dive to cool off at some point. He was wearing black shorts and a glistening naked
torso, already acquiring a faint honey colour, with a grey t-shirt carelessly
tucked on the waistband of his shorts, dangling in the air. Brown aviator sunglasses
hid his mischievous blue eyes and for a moment I remained there, speechless,
unable to believe I was actually married to this formidable man. “Hey there,
my bonny Sassenach.” He leaned down to peck my lips and I struggled not to hook
my legs around his waist, pulling him down and on top of me. “Fell of the
bed, did you, Duck?” I peeked above the rim of my own sunglasses, raising my
brows. “Abandoning your wife on the first morning of our honeymoon – I’m sure
there’s some good ol’ Scottish lore disapproving of the notion and foretelling
a world of unhappiness upon such bad omens.”He laughed,
brushing his arm against his forehead, and slumping on the chair beside mine. “T’was
the jetlag, aye? Needed to sweat it off a bit.”I braced on
my elbows (a quick glance verifying that my bosom looked perky and promising
underneath the red elastic fabric), and replied in my most suggestive voice,
“There were other ways to make you sweat, I’m sure.”We had
almost consummated our wedding on the beach near our house, amidst plaid and Wellington
boots, but returned to find the wedding party still bustling. The sun was
almost up when the last guest finally stumbled away, still singing, and we had
rushed to the airport right after for the first leg of our journey. After nearly
forty-eight hours of being Mrs. Fraser (his clan, his legacy, his
heart’s blood), I very much wanted the grace of his striking body against
mine to make it real. He cocked
his head, gave me a lopsided smile, but said nothing else. Instead, Jamie
stretched and yawned at length, the perfect arch of his body looking almost
obscene under the heavy sunlight (secret-less, shameless, daring).  While the
nagging feeling of purposefully being robbed of something rightfully mine didn’t
fade completely, we enjoyed the sweltering sun for a while, commenting on the
unparalleled beauty surrounding us. The broad span of pale golden sand allowed
for significant privacy, with other lodgers no more than dots on the horizon or
mild disturbances around the counter of the nearby bar (alcoholic beverages
with little paper umbrellas and large slices of pineapple and cherries on the
rim).Feeling
uncharacteristically restless and predatory, I eventually got up and cooed a “I’m
going to soak down for a while”, sauntering towards the tranquil sea and
expecting my husband to follow me promptly. I swam
languidly below the surface, my curly hair a weightless mass like a peculiar
water creature playing around me, and eventually emerged at a significant distance
from the line of sand. With a few powerful crawl strokes, Jamie reached my side
with a delighted moan at the water’s temperature. “It’s sizzling,
hm?” I caressed the slope of my neck, making a point of how hot I felt everywhere.
“It barely makes a dent on the heat.”“Aye.” Jamie
leaned back, so he was half-floating on his back. “It might ruin me proper for
ever going back to the North Sea.”I hummed in
agreement, eyeing the firmness of the muscles of his abdomen. “I might have to
take some clothing off to make it bearable, Duck.”He jerked
up, looking mildly alarmed, as I moved for the ties around my neck. “What - here?
Now?”“It wouldn’t
be the first time.” I furrowed my brows and bit my lip, equal parts aroused and
annoyed. “As I recall, you proposed inside a lake and we were naked. It’s our
thing, isn’t it?”“There are people
here, Sassenach.” He made a tutting sound with his tongue, raising his palms
in a splashing motion. “They’ll see us – or hear us. Your wee noises can
raise the deid. I’d rather not be arrested for public nudity and debauchery in
a country sae far away from home.” And much to my chagrin, a couple chose that
exact moment to start paddling in our direction with their boards, making me
want to roar in frustration. “Fi-ne,
Duck.” I mouthed, irritated. “Let’s do some snorkelling then. Is that safe
enough for you?”He grinned
back at me, amused by the utter annoyance and dismay in my tone, and kissed me
soundly on my right temple. I squeezed his left buttock in return, my fingers deftly
gripping the slippery fabric of his swimming attire. We had a
wonderful time braving the underwater world, where curious green and hawksbill turtles
drifted around us and fearless manta rays slipped against our skin, their accidental
touch foreign and disturbingly slick. Jamie made me laugh wholeheartedly by imitating
the half-scary half-hilarious face of a moray eel and I pointed a very small
shark lurking ominously at the distance. For lunch we
took shelter at a small restaurant with a lovely seafront, enjoying mouthfuls
of delicious green salads and creamy fish curry (Jamie traded his plate with
mine, once he realized I liked his order better), washed down with a local
cocktail called Maldivian Lady. All the time, while I giggled at something
Jamie had said, observed the rosy tone of his sunkissed cheeks, or marvelled at
the controlled grace of his toned body, my belly ached with a throbbing need,
pulsing with the best, thickest, part of my blood. “I’m going
to the washroom.” I declared, giving Jamie a meaningful onceover. “Will you
come with me – in case I…get lost…in the great wilderness?”He snorted and
squinted at me, knowing all too well even my feeble sense of orientation couldn’t
possibly make me go astray on my way to the bathroom on the back of the building.
However, I gripped his hand firmly and pulled him with me. “What are ye
doin’?” Jamie asked, slightly breathless with surprised laughter, as I pushed
him against the wall with my significantly less imposing frame, as soon as we
were out of sight. I positioned
myself between his legs, starting to ruck up my white sundress. “I’m sure this was
on your honeymoon list as well, Duck. I mean, don’t worry, I won’t last long - you
made me wait long enough to ensure it. Fast and hard, so I can breathe again, please.”His eyes were
several shades darker than what they had been with the reflection of water upon
them, and he seemed thoughtful and decided, even as he caressed the curve of my
waist. “Not here, Claire. Not like this. There is time for that later, mo
ghraidh.”“Really?!” I
hissed, my open fists bumping helplessly against his pectoralis major muscles
in pure exasperation. “Did you marry me to make me sexless, James Fraser? Are
you playing with me? What’s the point in all this?”He tilted
his chin and furrowed a brow, but before he could answer an employee of the hotel
passed by us carrying an unstable tower of beach towels, and we came apart like
magnets snapping away by some mysterious force. “I’m going
back to the villa.” I murmured, looking away from him and feeling ashamed in a
manner I couldn’t quite explain. “You might want to go for another jog, while I
cool down.”***Our villa
was fairly lovely with the orange and pink light of sundown infiltrating
through the wooden boards, cracks and slits filled with the promise of lingering
warmth to endure the night to come. I barely enjoyed it, pacing and sighing
like a tragic tropical prisoner, before I finally sat on the large bed, receiving
the sun’s goodbye through the open doors of our private porch. My fingers
mindlessly touched the engagement and wedding rings on my finger, reassuring me
like magical objects with secret powers within.“Claire.”
Jamie’s voice sounded close and I turned to watch him coming in, looking
cautious and beautiful in the half-light. “Is it alright for us to talk?”“I think we
need to.” I nodded, raising my chin in the hot defiance that frequently
followed my deepest vulnerability. “Are you avoiding making love to me?” A
ragged breath and then more words pouring out. “I get that we are married now
and maybe some things ought to change, but –““It’s no’
that.” My husband glared at me, as if willing me to understand some great
mystery. “I’ve wanted ye for years, Sassenach. I’ve wanted ye through nights
when ye didna want me back and through days when ye did. There will never come a
time when my body and soul forget the difference between the two.”“So why?” I
asked in a husky voice, awaiting as he sat next to me. “What happened today? I
mean, you certainly can have days when you’re not in the mood. I’ll probably
have them myself. But then tell it to me straight, damn it! Don’t deny
my touch and tell me a lie.”“Maybe I must
ken that ye need me, sometimes.” Jamie confessed softly, entwining our
fingers together, so that our wedding rings clashed against each other. “For many
years, ye’ve told me how ye’d fancy a lad, but never really needed him. It
broke my heart a little, the thought that ye’d never ken what is to need
someone so.” His forehead
leaned in and I allowed it to rest against mine, as I inhaled the smell of sun,
sweat and sea on his skin. “And while I am sure of what ye’ve found in
me, I’m not immune to my own weaknesses, my own – and maybe I need to hear it
from yer mouth from time to time. Maybe I need to drive ye wild with want, to
watch ye fight a little to lure me closer – and know we are always fighting the
same battle for closeness.”I touched
his high cheekbone, royal and solid, and felt a great tenderness washing over
me. “It’s a very hard thing to be a man sometimes, isn’t it?”“Never told
ye I’m not in the least vain and cocky.” He grinned self-deprecatingly,
brushing hips lips against mine. “It’s a hard thing to be a man with such a lass.
And also, the simplest one, at that.”“I love you.”
I told him, our eyes meeting fully. “I might never need you to change a
lightbulb or to drive me somewhere – but I need you, Jamie. You make
it make sense. You’re the man they sing about in the songs for me.”“Good.” My
long-time best friend made husband smiled tenderly and pulled me into his lap. “Because
I had a plan for tonight. To make it special for our first time together as Frasers.”
He rolled his eyes, emphasizing the evident mushy nature of his own words. “’Tis
what I was waiting for.”“Oh.” I
tilted my head in curiosity. “What’s this great plan I’m just now hearing
about?”“Get
undressed.” He kissed my lips, short and hot, the briefest trace of his tongue
tasting me. It made me think of the day he trapped me against his door after
kissing me on the road, arrogant and gentle, when I had realized this man
had the way of me. “And follow me, mo nighean donn.”He walked
outside, slipping his shirt away from his body, and I took off my dress and
bathing suit before I followed him to the night. Jamie stood stark naked on the
edge of the water surrounding us, the muscles on his back silvery and taut, his
cock half-hard. He offered me his hand and I took it, before we stepped down
together, until gentle water reached my clavicles. “There’s a
moon eclipse tonight. Soon it will be half a moon and then no more.” He
whispered against my ear, positioning himself behind me. His large palm held me
by the pubic bone, as the fingers of his other hand started to play with my
body, with my need. “Look up, Mrs. Fraser.” He bit my shoulder, his
teeth grazing the sensitive curve of my neck. “Watch the moon change as I take
ye.”

Jamie takes his wife while watching the moon eclipse … that’s a strong message of love, adoration of his lady, woman of his life.
The Moon is the symbol of women, and you bring this strongly into this beautiful ficlet ❤❤❤                            speedracermom liked this                                    yasminl reblogged this from renee-writer                                                                                                                                                                                    dapala12 liked this                                    gazingoffsouthward liked this                                    lafell liked this                                    lovetolearnposts reblogged this from thebrochtuarachs                                                                                                                                                                                    millefluer reblogged this from thebrochtuarachs                                                                                                                                                                                    nowayredsrulewth liked this                                    ayrlassie liked this                                    ladybirdparade liked this                                    sxc1naycontest liked this                                    strawberryfieldsbricksonwalls liked this                                    smblackburn reblogged this from renee-writer                                                                                                                                                                                    smblackburn liked this                                    25elprofe liked this                                    scubalass liked this                                    kikiange-01 liked this                                    salmongriller liked this                                    kalendraashtar posted this                                                                        ')[1].split('')[0];
