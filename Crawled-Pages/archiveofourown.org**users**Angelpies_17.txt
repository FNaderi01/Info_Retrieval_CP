    Summary
      Tony Stark and Loki have known each other long before the attack on New York. Tony is shocked to find that Loki doesn't remember him at all, that hence the reason Tony being thrown out the window, that is until he's slammed to the ground by The Hulk. When Tony sneaks a peek at the beginning of interrogations he discovers that the Loki that attacked New York has seemingly woken up from some kind of mind control, and is begging for help.

    Summary
      Kissing his best friend was never something Stiles thought would be an ongoing thing.  It became this spontaneous thing, finding physical comfort in each other when one of them was sad, furious, stressed, bored, excited, ridiculously horny, that slowly molded into something that Scott and Stiles just did. It was like another factor in their friendship, a factor that no one else knew about, a factor that was only for them, like some inside joke that they didn't share with anyone else because it was only something they could understand.
