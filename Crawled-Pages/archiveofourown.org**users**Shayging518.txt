  Summary
    At 6 years old, the son of Tony and Pepper Stark, Peter, is kidnapped, never to be seen again. Or, so they thought. Ten years later, while raiding a HYDRA base, the Avengers come across a new, enhanced individual, working for the enemy: in black spandex, with a tendency to stick to walls and shoot webs from his wrists, the Black Spider is a pain in the ass in more ways than one.

    Summary
      “Amenadiel!” he called out. “Brother! I could really need a lift back home!” he specified, frustration in his voice. “Any time now!” he hissed loudly but received nothing once more. Damn it. “This is really familiar,” Darcy muttered lowly.“Yeah…” Jane agreed, looking at a loss for what to do. “FATHER – you cannot leave me here!” Lucifer growled angrily. “I have stuff to do – you know this!”“Really   familiar,” Darcy sighed. Jane nodded and shushed her. ---Or, Lucifer utterly fails at returning to Hell at the end of season 4 and ends up in the Marvel Universe before the Avengers instead. Completely unoriginal concept, but I've had fun with it. Ignores timelines like nobody's business.
