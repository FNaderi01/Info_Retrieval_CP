    Summary
      “There’s nothing to tell.”“Liar, liar, pants on fire!” Klaus blocks his attempt of walking past by throwing an arm out and moving into his way. “Is it embarrassing?”“Go away, Klaus,” Diego groans, rubbing at his forehead. Christ, where’s a scary ghost when he needs one? Though, he immediately feels a bit bad for the thought as soon as it crosses his mind.“Not until you tell me.”“Be annoying somewhere else.”“Tell me, tell me, tell meee,” Klaus whines. “Did you fight with Luther again?”“No.”
