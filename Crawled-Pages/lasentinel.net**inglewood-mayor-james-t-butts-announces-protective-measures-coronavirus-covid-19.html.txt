GUIDANCE TO EMPLOYEES AND OTHER PROTECTIVE ACTIONS
The virus is transmitted by exposure. Short of closing City Hall we can limit potential transmission of COVID-19 by limiting contacts until the virus has passed the incubation contagion period.
Internally we should eliminate where possible visits to other workplaces for social purposes. Emergency Services will be examining proximity access privileges to ensure specific work site related access only.
Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
If soap and water are not readily available, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
Practice social distancing (no hugging, kissing or shaking hands).
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. If you do not have tissue, use your sleeve (not your hands).
Clean and disinfect your immediate workspace frequently.
Drink plenty of fluids such as water or Gatorade.
Employees exhibiting flu-like or other respiratory symptoms should stay home and away from the workplace. Notify your supervisor immediately if calling off sick.
Human Resources will maintain tracking of all sick call offs.
Employees are to limit unnecessary visits to other workgroups that are non-essential to the performance of their work.
All non-essential new or pre-approved business travel is prohibited until further notice unless reconsidered and approved in writing by the City Manager.
The Mayor, Elected Officials, Department Heads and the Office of Emergency Services (OES) are participating in daily/weekly tele-briefings with LA County Health, Elected Officials, City Managers and Public Safety agencies across the state.
OES is participating in daily/weekly conference calls with Area G Emergency Managers.
Additional cleaning staff has been assigned during business hours to disinfect public counters and high traffic areas at city facilities.
Hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes have been placed at all public counters.
Informational flyers and posters on the coronavirus and best practices have been placed at all city lobby entrances, employee breakrooms and elevator lobbies.
OES has a robust social media platform on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, and is providing a wealth of preparedness information to our residents and employees. We encourage everyone to follow us @ReadyInglewood.
