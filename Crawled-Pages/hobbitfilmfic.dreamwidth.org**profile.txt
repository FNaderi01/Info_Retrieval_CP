                 Mini Bio
                This community is dedicated to the characters in JRR Tolkien's The Hobbit, tangentially related characters from the same time period (from the Appendices to The Lord of the Rings), and the actors who play them in Peter Jackson's movie adaptations. While slash makes us squee most enthusiastically, we have no objections to posting het and gen fics. The community is open to both Fictional People Fiction (FPF) and Real People Fiction (RPF). Flaming posts and/or comments about the evils of RPF/RPS are not welcome and will be deleted.Content Guidelines:Hobbitfilmfic accepts FPF and RPF slash/femslash, het, and gen featuring any characters/actors, as well as FPF/RPF in other fandoms featuring actors from The Hobbit film and possible bridge events from The Hobbit to The Lord of the Rings.The community's sole requirement at this time is that all fic/art/misc. posts (be they slash, het or gen) include at least one character or actor from The Hobbit, as a focal point in the story/art/post.If you are not sure whether your fiction falls within the guidelines, please feel free to contact one of the moderators.Posting Guidelines:Place all fics, long discussion topics or title banners larger than 300 x 300 pixels behind LJ cuts. All fics should include a header containing the following information: Title, Author, Rating, Pairing, Summary, Disclaimer, Feedback, and Comments. Fics that warrant them should have proper warnings (incest, BDSM, etc.).Postings can consist of any of the following: fics, art, fic/art challenges, graphics/icons, actor/movie info, links to other people's fics/art, links to websites or challenges that would be of interest to the community. We also welcome discussion of character and craft in writing and of fandom in general; however, keep in mind that this is a forum where we can discuss ideas. It is not a place to launch personal attacks stemming from differences in interpretation. All such posts will also be deleted.All content in this journal should be considered copyrighted by the individual posters, and as such any/all unauthorized duplication or publication without their consent is illegal.
