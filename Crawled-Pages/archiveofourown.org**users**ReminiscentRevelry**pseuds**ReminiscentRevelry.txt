    Summary
      As common as soul marks were, they weren’t well understood. No one knew where they came from or how they were determined, but a few things had become clear throughout history.Every person had a soul mark over their heart that signified their own soul. The colors varied from person to person, and a colored soul mark elsewhere on your body meant that person was your romantic soulmate. A black mark was indicative of a parent-child soul bond and a white mark was a platonic bond. The marks would appear when the younger person was born, and some faded over time or disappeared or scarred upon death, but most stayed.
