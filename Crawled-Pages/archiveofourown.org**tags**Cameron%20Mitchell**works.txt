    Summary
      ‘Hi, Mer McKay, PhD, PhD, autistic, genius, gender ambivalent, queer and kinky as fuck, compulsive over-sharer.’ He gave John the kind of firm handshake that was usually accompanied by words like “Gemma Radcliffe, CEO,” or “Matthew Smith, vice president.” The man was so open, so honest, so utterly without game or guile that John was almost charmed. But he was also completely thrown.

    Summary
      "It felt entirely too dangerous to be anything but fully Sekhmet, and yet, Nes couldn't do that. Not now. Not with him." Final installment of Nesert, overlapping with SG1 seasons 9-10, a few dips into SGA, and movies. Original character story intertwining with series without disrupting canon. Completed and will post several chapters a week.

    Summary
      We know what happened to the Odyssey. The bubble timeline never occurred and Teal'c saved the day by sacrificing decades of his life. Or do we? Tampering with time is rarely that simple. What happens when reality shatters and the Ascended have to pick up the pieces? A bullied girl in a locker becomes one of the most advanced ships imagined. Rated T for Worm-style swearing.
