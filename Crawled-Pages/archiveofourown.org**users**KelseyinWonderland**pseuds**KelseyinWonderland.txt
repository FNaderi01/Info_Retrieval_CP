    Summary
      Draco and Harry are forced to spend the summer before 6th year in Surrey with the Dursley's. Both boy's are forced to face so many things they'd rather shove deep down into the deepest recesses of themselves, despite their promise to save their brooding and anger for the end of summer. Two steadfast enemies spend the summer teaching each other that it's okay to feel, and that they aren't as steadfast as they thought.

    Summary
      Draco and Harry both return to Hogwarts for their 8th year hoping to gain different things after spending the summer taking a personal inventory of themselves. When Harry is drawn to a softer and less rigid Malfoy, he can't keep himself from his old habits and finds himself seeking him out....through various moments of gazing at one another, and irrational decisions too engage in conversation the boys end up bonding through novels and Harry learns what created the softer, more thoughtfully spoken Malfoy, and of course love ensues.**I do want to note that I was inspired a lot by "Call Me By Your Name" by, André Aciman. However, I definitely tried to write it in a way that wouldn't prohibit anyone who hasn't read the book or seen the movie from understanding the references! If you haven't seen the movie, or more importantly read the book you definitely should it is so achingly amazingly beautiful!! **

    Summary
  Normally having Sokka by his side for these sorts of events made them more bearable, but Zuko wasn’t sure he would be able to bear letting Sokka loose in public looking like that. 
 Another night, another obligatory political function, and another room full of people who can't seem to stop flirting with Sokka. Zuko gets understandably jealous and takes matters into his own hands. Or, was it mouth?

    Summary
      After getting Ian back Mickey almost comes to terms with his sexuality but still doesn't feel safe expressing it. He finds an unexpected solution when he gets his hands on a pair of handcuffs while scaming an older pervert together with Ian.***If Mickey thought that letting Ian kiss him, worship his body or whatever sappy things Gallagher always wanted to do to him is too gay... Being the one enjoying other boy's body, wanting to trail his tongue over the hard abs, scrape his teeth over the sharp hipbones and actually take his time touching those long-ass legs he has been drooling over since they first fucked? That was even more fucking gay.Great Russian translation from the great Jane McArrow: https://ficbook.net/readfic/9881972.

    Summary
      It's not the first time Harry's been the victim of a botched curse (that's one of the reasons he doesn't like crowds), but he feels bad that Malfoy had to get caught up in it too.So they're bonded. That's ok, they just have to make sure to be touching at all time. No problem. Because Malfoy smells so nice, and has such lovely shiny hair, and his skin is so very warm. But this isn't going to be a problem for their friendship at all. Is it, Harry?
