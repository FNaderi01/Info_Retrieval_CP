    Summary
      Wei Wuxian was fully prepared to be rejected – no matter what Jiang Cheng said about the Sunshot Campaign caring more about defeating the Wens than anything else, the fact remained that his cultivation was most decidedly abnormal and unorthodox, the sort of thing the cultivation world most scorned. He’d already decided that if they did that, he would return to his previous approach of stalking the Wens from the shadows, fighting them in his own way, on his own.Instead, he walked into the command tent, Chenqing gripped tightly in his hand, and Nie Mingjue didn’t so much as blink, just said, “Can you do anything but ambushes?” and the next thing he knew, it was three shichen later, he’d shared far more than he’d meant to about his new cultivation style, and there were eight different plans of attack that would greatly increase his effectiveness on the battlefield.It was – exhilarating, actually.(in which Nie Mingjue and Wei Wuxian become sworn brothers)

    Summary
      Instead flaunting his power by forcing twenty juniors from each sect to be taught by his incompetent son, Wen Ruohan decides to take a subtler route. At Qishan’s Grand Discussion Conference, every sect heir and their second-most prominent disciple finds themselves forced into a marriage carefully crafted to mock them. Worst affected is the Gusu Lan Sect, where the twin Jades find themselves in marriages to two men. Lan Wangji is ordered to marry the shameless Wei Wuxian who touched his forehead ribbon, and Lan Xichen is ordered to marry the widely-mocked bastard of Jin Guangshan... who may be less innocent than he appears.

    Summary
      This was why he didn’t like to leave the Unclean Realm, Nie Mingjue thought with dismay. Guileless dark eyes blinked up at him, tiny hands clutching at his robes. Or: Nie Mingjue comes across Wei Wuxian before Jiang Fengmian, and decides Nie Huaisang could use a friend.

  Summary
    Wei Ying and Lan Zhan somehow find time to be student sweethearts at Cloud Recesses, and it changes the course of the war.  Mashup of novel and drama, with bonus donghua and a little manhua as a treat.  Anything that wasn’t AU before Cloud Recesses is certainly AU after.  Fluffy fix-it with very little plot and a lot of Lan Zhan and Wei Ying being super cute together.
