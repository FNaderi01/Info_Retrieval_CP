            Building a Magical Home        Originally posted by mayleeillustrationOne of my favorite quotes about the magic of homemaking comes from Cory Hutcheson, host of the New World Witchery podcast. He says, ‚ÄúHome is a transformational act. It is the thing you do to turn a space into a space‚Ä¶ that is full of ritual and significance and meaning. So there is sort of this ongoing relationship you have with the space that makes it a home.‚ÄùThe act of creating a home, of making a space your own, is inherently magical. But if you want to make your space feel a little more witchy, here are some ideas to get you started.Charms and TalismansMaking your own magical objects can be a powerful way to bring magic into your space. The best thing about making your own charms is that you can make them look however you want, so it‚Äôs easy to disguise them as ordinary household objects. You can make a charm for any intention by combining objects based on their magical correspondences.I‚Äôve talked about protective charms in previous posts, so I‚Äôm not gonna spend a lot of time on it here. The simplest protective charm is keeping a large piece of iron under your bed to keep away nightmares, evil spirits, and negative energy. You could also make your own protection charm, like a witch bottle.You can create a ‚Äúhappy home‚Äù charm to bring peace, harmony, and happiness into your home. This charm could include herbs like basil, rosemary, lavender, peppermint, and/or bay leaves, as well as other items that you associate with peace and good fortune, like lucky coins, crystals, or black cat fur. Write your desires for a harmonious and happy home on a piece of paper, fold it up, and add it to the charm. You could store these items in a green bag, bury them in your backyard (in this case, make sure you‚Äôre only using biodegradable plant matter ‚Äî leave out the coins and crystals), or place it inside a household object like a lamp or an end table.If you suffer from insomnia or other sleep issues, try making a dream charm to help you sleep well and have sweet dreams. To make a simple dream charm, fill a blue or purple bag with lavender, chamomile, peppermint, and any other objects that you associate with peace, restfulness, and sleep. If you want to have lucid dreams or receive psychic messages in your dreams, include a bit of mugwort. Place the charm in your pillow or under your mattress. (I personally swear by this one, as it‚Äôs helped a lot with my insomnia.)Charms are great for homemaking magic because you‚Äôre actually creating a magical object, which can then become a permanent fixture of the space.Magical DecorYou can use magical items to decorate your home to bring certain qualities into that space.Hanging or displaying a broom is said to bring good fortune, protection from evil, and good hospitality. Cauldrons are used to represent the Goddess, rebirth, and raw potential. Horseshoes hung above door frames bring safety and luck to all who cross under them, and keep unwanted guests away. If you can get them legally and ethically, animal bones, teeth, claws, and feathers can represent the spirit and energy of that animal. You can also put up images of spiritual and occult symbols ‚Äî I have an image of the Sun tarot card hanging in my bedroom to promote positivity and growth.If you need to be a little more subtle with your witchy decorations, working with the magic of color is a great way to do that. Gathering a lot of items of a single color in one room changes the energy of that room. Here‚Äôs a quick guide to give you some ideas:Yellow is associated with divination, mental clarity, the element of air, success, communication, and inspiration.Purple is associated with divine power, spiritual awareness, mystery, astral travel, magic, and authority.Blue is associated with healing, psychic abilities, the element of water, peace, truth, and patience.Red is associated with protection, the fire element, sex, power, vitality, and love.Orange is associated with ambition, creativity, breaking through blockages, and career success.Pink is associated with romantic love, friendship, self love, compassion, and emotional well-being.Green is associated with nature, herbalism, the earth element, money, wealth, prosperity, and luck.Brown is associated with grounding, animal magic, stability, and balance.White is associated with purification, cleansing, the full moon, new beginnings, healing, and spiritual growth.Black is associated with protection, truth, outer space, banishing, and transition.Decorating your home with colors that are meaningful to you can create a powerful magical space. You may also have your own color associations (for example, yellow is a very ‚Äúhappy‚Äù color for me), so feel free to incorporate those into your decor as well!Originally posted by myrsparvGrowing Magical HouseplantsMost witches feel a very deep connection to nature and draw power from the natural world, but we can‚Äôt all live in a cottage in the heart of the forest. Even if you live in a tiny apartment in the city, you can still bring nature into your space by keeping houseplants. Many popular houseplants have magical uses, and many popular magic herbs can be grown inside. Here are a few to get you started.Aloe. This is one of my favorite plants. Aloe brings luck and protection, especially protection on an energetic/spiritual level. I like to keep aloe in my bedroom to protect me while I sleep, as well as to bring luck and inspiration while I‚Äôm working at my desk.Basil. Basil is very popular in money spells, and will attract prosperity and luck to your home. However, it also has protective properties ‚Äî both spiritual protection and protection from bugs, since basil is a natural insect repellent! Basil can also be used in love spells, and is just generally a good plant to have around for good vibes.African Violet. This flowering plant attracts positive spiritual energy into your space. It has associations with the moon and the water element, and is very good for promoting spirituality and psychic power.Rosemary. Rosemary is one of those herbs that every witch should have on hand. It‚Äôs so darn versatile, it can be used as a substitute for virtually any other herb, and can be used for almost any intention. Some of the most common magical associations for rosemary include: cleansing, purification, protection, healing, mental activity, and enhancing memory. According to author Deborah J. Martin, there‚Äôs an old English saying that, ‚ÄúWhere rosemary grows, the woman rules the house.‚Äù Like basil, rosemary is a natural insect repellent.Lavender. Lavender brings peace, love, and gentleness, which makes it a perfect addition to any home. It can be used in spells for cleansing and purification, enhancing psychic abilities, and stress relief. Lavender is also a powerful addition to love spells. Keeping lavender in the bedroom can aid in restful sleep, while lavender in the kitchen will bring harmony to the home.Sage. Sage is the most talked about cleansing herb, and with good reason. Unfortunately, a lot of the sage bundles you can buy at metaphysical stores are made with white sage (Salvia apiana), which is sacred to Native American peoples and is endangered due to overharvesting. Instead of buying those, why not grow your own garden sage (Salvia officinalis), which has a lot of the same magical properties? Growing sage in your home will purify the space and protect those who live there. Sage also has an association with wisdom and mental prowess.Hoya. Hoya is a common houseplant that you‚Äôve probably seen even if you don‚Äôt know it by name. It has a distinctive appearance with waxy, dark green leaves and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers. Hoya aligns and balances the energy centers within your body, as well as in the surrounding space. It‚Äôs associated both with grounding and with spiritual openness, so it can be great for balancing the two.Peppermint. Peppermint has a variety of magical uses, but my favorite way to use it is for gently opening up blockages and getting things moving. It‚Äôs great for cleansing, but is more gentle than rosemary or sage. Place it in any room where you tend to do a lot of healing work, or where you could use some peace and love. Peppermint is also used in dream magic, so growing it in the bedroom may bring on vivid or lucid dreams.Orchid. Orchids are used in magic for love and lust. Historically, orchid has been used in folk medicine to promote male virility and ‚ÄúJezebel root,‚Äù used in American folk magic to attract wealthy male lovers, is a type of orchid root. If you live with a significant other, try growing an orchid in the bedroom to promote passion in your sex life. Otherwise, grow orchids in your home to promote love or to attract romance.Catnip. If you have cats, they‚Äôll love this one. Catnip is actually a type of mint, and has strong lunar associations. It‚Äôs said to make one more charming and attractive, and is especially useful for attracting women. At the same time, catnip promotes courage and fierceness. It is also, of course, associated with cats and feline deities, so this is definitely a plant you‚Äôll want to keep around if the cat is one of your animal guides.If you have a yard space that you can turn into an outdoor garden, your magical plant options are limited only by your local ecosystem. Some outdoor plants that have magical uses include roses, sunflowers, rue, lemon balm, and strawberries.Creating an AltarAltars are focal points of magical and spiritual energy. Many people, both witches and non-witches, find that having a designated space for their spiritual practice creates a deeper sense of sacredness and purpose.An altar can serve lots of different purposes. Many witches use their altar as a magical work space to prepare spells, meditate, and do divination. You may choose to dedicate your altar to a deity, your ancestors, or some other spirit(s) you work with. You can also build altars for specific intentions, such as a money altar or a love altar ‚Äî performing rituals at this altar everyday is a powerful method for manifestation. You altar may be some or all of these things, or it may just be a place to sit and connect with the spiritual.You can set up an altar on any flat surface, like a shelf or table, or inside a container like a jewelry box. Your setup can be as simple or as elaborate as you like. An altar can be huge and complex, with statues and candles and flowers, or it can be as simple as a tealight and an incense burner. It‚Äôs all about what appeals to you.Resources: New World Witchery pocast, ‚ÄúEpisode 143 ‚Äî The Magical Home‚ÄùSouthern Cunning: Folkloric Witchcraft in the American South by Aaron OberonWicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner by Scott Cunningham‚ÄúCandle colors and their meanings‚Äù by Michelle Gruben on the Grove and Grotto blogGreen Witchcraft by Paige VanderbeckA Green Witch‚Äôs Cupboard by Deborah J.

            Banishing Nasty Spirits        Originally posted by adventurelandiaIf you‚Äôve been following this series of posts, you know why a witch might work with spirits, how to establish a relationship with a spirit, and how to communicate with spirits. What we haven‚Äôt yet discussed is how to get rid of spirits that are bothersome, annoying, or malevolent.I was planning to talk about pathworking and astral travel before getting into banishing, but in light of some asks I recently received on Tumblr, I think it‚Äôs important that we take a moment to discuss how to get rid of spirits that, for whatever reason, you don‚Äôt want around.There are lots of reasons you might not want a spirit in your space. Just like with people, some spirits just aren‚Äôt a good fit for you and your practice. Part of being a spirit worker is cultivating a ‚Äúspirit team‚Äù of beings that you can have healthy and beneficial relationships with.Some spirits are mischievous and like to cause trouble. If you find yourself on the receiving end of lots of spirit pranks, you may want to gently encourage them to move along. And there are some spirits out there who just genuinely hate humans and will go out of their way to cause mental, emotional, and even physical harm.Don‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äî malevolent spirits aren‚Äôt common. In my experience, the vast majority of unwanted spirits are more annoying than dangerous. I‚Äôm not saying this to scare you or make you paranoid. But these things do exist, and it would be negligent of me not to mention them in a series on spirit work.There‚Äôs a reason that one of the most common truisms in witchcraft is, ‚ÄúNever conjure something you can‚Äôt banish.‚Äù If you‚Äôre going to be working with spirits, it‚Äôs a good idea to know how to banish them just in case. With that being said, here‚Äôs how you can clear out any nasties that may be lingering in your space.CleansingThe first step is to kick those unwanted spirits out of your space. There are lots of ways to do this, so choose the one that is the best fit for you.Cleansing with fire and smoke is a very old and very simple method. If this is the way you decide to go, there are several magical substances you can burn to banish spirits. Burning sulfur or asafetida will clear out just about anything, but they both smell awful and are potentially toxic, so you‚Äôll want to get an okay from the other people living in your home, burn a little at a time, and make sure you have lots of windows open. (Some people say sulfur and asafetida will banish all spirits, not just the unfriendly ones, so you may have to invite your spirit team back in later.) For something that smells a little more pleasant, you can try a mix of frankincense and myrrh resin, or burn a mix of dried rosemary, sage (garden sage, not endangered white sage, please!), and bay leaves ‚Äî but again, make sure you have windows open, because these get smoky. Plus, you want the windows and/or doors open so the spirits have somewhere to go when the smoke chases them out.If smoking up your living space isn‚Äôt an option for you, you can manually clean your space with a wash or powder. If you have hardwoods, you can make a floor wash with water, salt, lemon juice, rosewater, lavender essential oil, and either bay laurel or rosemary essential oil. (This is adapted from an uncrossing bath in the book Utterly Wicked by Dorothy Morrison.) Use this mixture to mop your floors, as well as to wipe down your walls and furniture. If you have a humidifier or essential oil diffuser, diffusing some of this mix would also be a good idea.If you have carpet, you can make a powder by combining salt, dried lemon peel, dried roses, lavender flowers, and bay leaves. You‚Äôll need to ground this really fine, so I recommend using a coffee grinder or food processor. Sprinkle the powder on your carpet, let it sit for a few minutes, and then vacuum it up. I would supplement this by also diffusing a mix of saltwater with rosewater, lemon juice, and lavender and/or bay laurel essential oil. If you don‚Äôt have a diffuser, at least sprinkle some saltwater around the room and on your belongings.No matter which form of cleansing you decide to use, it‚Äôs important to verbally state your intention to banish these unwanted spirits from your space. Tell them out loud that they are no longer welcome here and that they need to leave. Don‚Äôt be rude about it, but be firm and speak clearly and with confidence.After you cleanse your space, it‚Äôs a good idea to cleanse yourself as well to remove any psychic ties to the spirits you‚Äôve just banished. The easiest way to do this is with a ritual bath. The floor wash recipe mentioned earlier can also be used as a psychic cleansing bath. Other options include a bath with salt, frankincense, and myrrh or a bath with salt, rosemary, sage, and bay laurel. You can use essential oils for your bath, or add the resins and herbs to a cheesecloth bag and drop it into the tub for easy diffusing and cleanup.If you don‚Äôt have a bathtub, you can cleanse yourself in the shower. Place two cups of salt in a bowl. Add lemon juice, rosewater, lavender essential oil, and either bay laurel or rosemary essential oil. If you don‚Äôt have essential oils, you can add dried lavender and crushed bay leaves. Add some of your favorite body wash to create a scrub (if you don‚Äôt have body wash, use olive oil). While in the shower, use this mixture to scrub your skin ‚Äî visualize yourself scrubbing away any psychic gunk you might have picked up.Originally posted by dayaftermoonProtectionOnce you‚Äôve removed any unwanted spirits from your space, you want to lay down some protection to keep them from coming back. There are as many ways to ward off spirits as there are witches, but here are a few ideas to get you started.One option is to create a ward. You can do this by anointing the door frames, door knobs, and window frames of your home with a protective oil blend and/or by creating lines of salt across your doorways and just inside your windows. You can use other protective substances if you prefer. As you lay down these protections, visualize a protective shield around your home, and speak aloud your intention to keep harmful spirits out.Iron is said to repel spirits. Keep a railroad spike or other large piece of iron under your bed to prevent nightmares and to keep spirits from messing with you while you sleep. There‚Äôs an old superstition that says that hammering iron nails into the four corners of your home protects it from spirits ‚Äî this may not be possible if you‚Äôre renting, but you can create a similar effect by displaying a piece of iron in each of the four corners of your home. Hematite is a crystal that is high in iron, so it can be used in a similar way to ward off spirits.Aloe is said to protect from negative spirits, and to bring protection and good luck more generally. It‚Äôs also a common house plant that is easy to care for, so this method of protection is especially great for witches who need to keep their practice a secret. Keep several aloe plants in your home to protect those who live there.For witches with a crafty side, making a witch bottle is another option for protection. There are lots of different recipes for witch bottles, but the basic method is to fill a bottle with sharp objects, add something from your body, and hide it somewhere outside your home (traditionally buried on the property, but leaving it in an outbuilding works just as well). The idea is that any nasty spirit that comes looking for you will be attracted to the bottle (because it contains part of your body), get caught by the sharp objects, and be trapped. To create a simple witch bottle, fill a mason jar about halfway with sewing pins, then add a bit of your hair and some of your fingernail clippings, and finally fill it with liquid (traditionally, this liquid is your own urine, but if that makes you uncomfortable vinegar will also work). If you want, you can also include some of your favorite banishing herbs, resins, or crystals.Religious symbols can also keep nasty spirits away. If you identify strongly with a religion, display protective symbols from that faith in your living space. For example: a Christian witch might hang up a crucifix or set out a statue of Archangel Michael, a Norse pagan witch might hang up an image of Mjolnir, a Hindu witch might display a statue of Durga, etc. Sometimes the most effective way to keep nasty spirits away is to let them know that you‚Äôre under the protection of someone more powerful.When dealing with unwanted spirits, the most important thing to remember is that you do not need to be afraid. You are a powerful witch, and you are more than capable of getting rid of them. Be confident in your abilities and know that whatever happens, you can handle it.Resources:Southern Cunning: Folkloric Witchcraft in the American South by Aaron OberonA Green Witch‚Äôs Cupboard by Deborah J.

            Pathworking and Astral Travel        Originally posted by demariocIn spirit work, we often connect with the spirits that have crossed over and are present in the physical world. However, there are also ways to cross over into the spirit world and connect with spirits in their home environment.PathworkingAs I mentioned in a previous post, a pathworking is a specific type of meditation where you go on a psychic journey, but are still anchored to your physical body. It‚Äôs sort of like dipping your toes into the spirit world.There are two important elements to a pathworking: a clear entrance/exit point and a way to retrace your steps. Pathworking journeys are typically cyclical ‚Äî there is both a journey out and a return where you go back the way you came. This makes it easier to fully return your consciousness to your body, and failing to do so can cause you to feel disoriented upon the return.Your entry/exit point can be absolutely anything, but common examples include a door, a gateway, a tree (or sometimes The World Tree), a cave/tunnel, or a natural landmark like a beach or mountaintop. What‚Äôs important is that it‚Äôs recognizable and easy to find your way back to.If you want to try pathworking, make a rough ‚Äúroad map‚Äù of your journey beforehand. This doesn‚Äôt have to be super specific, but it should contain the following: a goal for the pathworking (such as to connect with a certain spirit), an entry/exit point, and a general idea for the route you‚Äôre going to take. If you‚Äôre worried about getting lost, author Thea Sabin recommends using ‚Äúthe Theseus trick.‚Äù Like in the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur, you can tie a golden thread or rope to your entry point and the other end to your astral body. If you get lost, you can follow the thread back.Pathworking is fairly beginner friendly, and I highly, highly, highly recommend starting with pathworking and becoming comfortable with this method before trying astral travel. Even for more advanced witches, pathworking is often a better option than astral travel because it‚Äôs less involved and requires a little bit less effort. I personally prefer pathworking for most situations.Performing a PathworkingBefore you begin, establish a clear goal for your pathworking and write out a rough ‚Äúroad map.‚Äù At the very least, you should know what your purpose is, where your entry point is, and how to find your way back.Begin in a dark, quiet room. Cleanse the room by burning incense, diffusing or spraying essential oils, or using a ritual broom to sweep out old energy.Find a comfortable place to sit or lie down and begin meditating. You may want to play meditation music, practice breathing techniques, or use some other method to help you reach a meditative state.Once you reach a meditative state (you should know what this feels like if you have experience with meditation), see yourself standing at your entry point. This is your entrance to the astral realm.Set out on your pathworking.When you are ready to leave the astral realm, you will need to find your way back to your entry point. Once you reach your entry point, it should be fairly easy to return to your body.Once you‚Äôre fully present in your physical body, use your favorite method to ground yourself.Write down everything you experienced during your pathworking in a journal.Originally posted by weed-and-poetryAstral TravelIf pathworking is dipping your toes into the spirit world, astral travel is diving in the deep end. Also called spirit flight and hedge riding, astral travel includes actually sending your soul/consciousness out of your body and into the spirit world. As you might guess, this is more complicated and requires more effort than pathworking. For this reason, astral travel is not beginner-friendly. If you are completely new to meditation, witchcraft, and spirit work, it‚Äôs best to learn to pathwork before you attempt astral travel.A word of warning: you may want to avoid astral travel at times when you‚Äôre in a very vulnerable or volatile emotional state. Some days you just aren‚Äôt up for it, and that‚Äôs okay. On those days, a pathworking or another form of spirit work may be a better option.Triggering Spirit FlightIn astral travel, a trigger of some kind is used to help disconnect the soul from the physical body. Common triggers include drumming, special music, shaking a rattle, chanting, and dancing.You can find shamanic drumming tracks on YouTube that can help you achieve astral travel. If you find that repetitive motion helps you trance out, you may look into getting a small drum or rattle to play.Animal GuidesIn many cultures, those who travel into the spirit world do so with the guidance and protection of an animal spirit. From the Norse fylgja, to the shamanic power animal, to the witch‚Äôs familiar, history is full of examples of these types of guides.Before you begin astral travel, do a pathworking to meet your animal guide. It‚Äôs important to note that you aren‚Äôt choosing an animal guide ‚Äî only meeting one that has always been with you. Your guide may be an animal that you like or identify with, or it may not. When I first began experimenting with astral travel, my guide was a coyote ‚Äî an animal I had never identified with before, but who I learned was deeply connected to my inner self.It‚Äôs important to always have your animal guide with you when going on astral journeys, as they are an important source of protection and power. They may also literally guide you to the things you need to see and the spirits you need to meet.Flying OintmentsHistorical accounts describe witches using ‚Äúflying ointment‚Äù to help them achieve spirit flight. These traditional flying ointments contained toxic and/or hallucinogenic plants like belladonna, datura, henbane, mandrake, and opium poppies. For obvious reasons, most modern witches do not use these herbs.Please do not try to create your own flying ointment with poisonous plants. If you‚Äôre a true traditionalist and feel like you just have to try a historically accurate flying ointment, Bane Folk Apothecary sells several. Bane Folk is run by Sarah Anne Lawless, a kickass witch who knows her stuff and produces safe, medicinal products inspired by traditional flying ointment formulas. I am usually very pro-DIY, especially when it comes to witchcraft, but this is one case where it really is best to defer to a professional.To create a modern, non-toxic flying ointment: heat eight ounces (or one cup) of poppy seed oil over low heat on the stove. Once the oil is warm, add 2 ounces (or ¬º cup) of beeswax into the oil. (Use carnauba wax for a vegan alternative.) Take the mixture off the heat, and allow it to cool off a bit. Once it has cooled (but before it‚Äôs begun to solidify), add nine drops each of mugwort essential oil, star anise essential oil, and peppermint essential oil. Pour the mixture into a mason jar and seal tightly. To extend your ointment‚Äôs shelf life, add a few drops of Vitamin E oil and store in the refrigerator. If you don‚Äôt have access to essential oils or prefer a more traditional method, you can buy dry herbs and infuse them into your oil instead ‚Äî to do this, crush up 2.5 ounces (or 1/3 cup) each of dried mugwort, star anise, and peppermint and add them to a mason jar; add enough oil to the jar to cover the herbs completely, with about an inch of oil above them; seal the jar and place it in a sunny window for 2-3 weeks to infuse; and finally, strain the herbs out of the oil with a mesh sieve or a cheesecloth. You can then add your Vitamin E oil and beeswax to create an ointment.This modern recipe does not contain hallucinogens, but it does contain plants that are commonly used in magic to increase psychic abilities and aid in astral travel. You can say an incantation over this ointment while making it to add some extra magical potency. Applying the flying ointment can also become a sort of ritual that prepares you for spirit flight by helping you slip into a more spiritual head space.Performing Astral Travel/Spirit FlightBefore you begin, know why you are journeying to the spirit world. You should always have a clear goal for your astral journeys.Begin in a dark, quiet room. Cleanse the room by burning incense (mugwort incense aids in astral travel), diffusing or spraying essential oils, or using a ritual broom to sweep out old energy.Use your favorite method to ground yourself.If you are choosing to use a flying ointment, rub it on your skin now.Hold a protective item in one of your hands. I like physical items for protection during spirit flight, because they can ground you and help you find your way back to your body. Examples of protective items include a sprig of rue, a piece of iron, or a protective crystal like black tourmaline. If you ever feel scared or uncomfortable during your journey, you can bring this object into the astral realm to protect you. It will also keep your body safe while your consciousness is occupied.Start up your trigger, whether this is drumming, rattling, dancing, etc.Allow yourself to drift into a trance state, and then to disconnect from your body.Call your animal guide to you.Set out on your journey in the spirit world.When you are ready, feel yourself returning to your physical body. Allow yourself to come back slowly ‚Äî don‚Äôt rush it.Ground yourself. One good way to ground after astral travel is by eating a snack.Write down your experiences in a journal.Resources:Wicca for Beginners by Thea SabinSouthern Cunning: Folkloric Witchcraft in the American South by Aaron OberonHedge Riding by Harmonia Saille‚ÄúHow to Make Herb-Infused Oils for Culinary &amp; Body Care Use‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow to Make Herbal Salves‚Äù from the Mountain Rose Herbs blog

            Working with Spirits        Originally posted by ghiblighibsIn my last post, I talked about different types of spirits that witches may work with. Today, we‚Äôre going to discuss how to approach spirits and establish a working relationship.Keep in mind that these are general guidelines, and every spirit is different. I encourage you to do your own research beyond this post, especially if you plan to work with powerful entities like deities, angels, or fairies.Remember the Four R‚ÄôsIt‚Äôs important to keep these things in mind when working with spirits:Respect. The spirits are powerful, and you need to have a healthy respect for that power when working with them. It‚Äôs also important to respect them as individual, autonomous beings.I‚Äôm not saying that every interaction you have with the spirits needs to be a full blown ritual with incense and chanting. (In fact, some spirits don‚Äôt care for those types of rituals.) But every interaction you have with them should be conducted with an air of respect and reverence.What this mostly boils down to is good manners. Being polite will get you better results ‚Äî and it will also keep you from being on the receiving end of spirit mischief. Proper etiquette depends on the type of spirit you‚Äôre working with, which is one reason it‚Äôs important to do your research. In general, it‚Äôs polite to make an offering, use respectful language, and thank the spirits before you leave (unless you‚Äôre dealing with fairies ‚Äî some traditions say you should never thank the fae).Respecting spirits also means respecting their desires ‚Äî even if that means respecting their wish not to work with you. Not every spirit you reach out to will want to form a relationship with you, just like not every person you meet in your life will want to be your friend. When a spirit turns you down, respect their decision, politely bid them farewell, and move on.Reciprocity. The goal of spirit work is to establish a mutually-beneficial partnership ‚Äî not for one partner to serve the other. On one hand, this means that you can‚Äôt just command spirits to do your bidding without giving anything in return. On the other hand, it also means that you won‚Äôt be worshiping/honoring them without receiving some kind of boon.This is why it‚Äôs important to make offerings to the spirits you work with. These offerings ‚Äúfeed‚Äù the spirits by giving them power, and a good offering will likely make a spirit more willing to work with you. Offerings are not payment for favors from spirits (it‚Äôs not quite that simple), but they are a sign that you intent to practice reciprocity in your relationship.In general, it‚Äôs important to make an offering when you first introduce yourself to a spirit and again before you ask them for anything. But you shouldn‚Äôt only make offerings when you‚Äôre about to ask for something! How would you feel if you had a friend who only did nice things for you when they were about to ask for a favor? You‚Äôd probably start avoiding them, right? You might even get angry. To avoid this kind of dynamic in your spirit work, make regular offerings to the spirits you work with. If you‚Äôre especially close with a spirit, you may want to offer to them every day.Relationship. The spirits are not vending machines where you put offerings in and blessings fall out. They are living, sentient beings with feelings, and deserve to be treated as such. Your relationship with the spirits you choose to work with is just that: a relationship. And like any relationship, it requires time, energy, and emotional labor.If that sounds like more effort than you want to make, there are plenty of ways to do magic without ever working with spirits. You don‚Äôt need to do spirit work to be a witch. It may not be your thing, and that‚Äôs okay!But if you choose to work with spirits, it‚Äôs important to remember that you are working with them as an equal partner ‚Äî you‚Äôre not their boss, and they are not obligated to like you, help you, or even tolerate you. Relationships with spirits are built over time, through mutual respect and trust.You wouldn‚Äôt drive up to your friend‚Äôs house, throw a fast-food burger at them, and then demand a special favor. Likewise, you shouldn‚Äôt just dump an offering on your altar and demand something of the spirits. Take the time to sit down with them. Talk to them. Get to know them. Put some thought into your offerings, instead of just offering the same thing every time. Spirit work is, at its core, about building an authentic relationship with the spirits we choose to include in our practice. Enjoy it.Research. When it comes to spirits, it‚Äôs important to know exactly who (and what) you‚Äôre dealing with. As previously mentioned, the etiquette for dealing with fairies is very different from other land spirits. Different deities have different standards for their worshipers, which vary from one pantheon to the next. The way you interact with your ancestors will probably be shaped by their personalities, cultures, and values. All this is to say it‚Äôs important to know who you‚Äôre reaching out to, preferably before you reach out to them.With deities, this is easy. Most witches who choose to work with deities will feel drawn to a certain pantheon, or even a specific god or goddess. There‚Äôs a lot of information out there about most historical pantheons, so researching them is easy. The same goes for angels, saints, demons, and even fairies.It can be a little more difficult to do your research when you‚Äôre dealing with land spirits, spirits of place, or other less well-known figures. In these cases, it‚Äôs best to take three steps: 1.) figure out what type of spirit you‚Äôre dealing with (land spirit, animal spirit, ancestor, etc.), 2.) find out what this type of spirit is like generally, and 3.) find out how that applies to your specific spirit.For example: you want to connect with your local land spirits. You do some research to find out how land spirits have been treated in various cultures ‚Äî you find out that they‚Äôre typically benevolent, are closely tied to the natural landscape, and were often given food offerings. Then, you do some research into your local plants and animals ‚Äî what form might a nature spirit take in your local environment? Would it be a huge moose with snow-covered antlers, or a magnolia tree in full bloom? Is there any local folklore in your area that could be describing a land spirit? Once you have answers to these questions, you‚Äôll have a much better idea of how to approach the spirits and start up a relationship.Originally posted by crazycinephilesInitiating a Relationship with a SpiritBegin by identifying who this spirit is. For example, let‚Äôs say you choose to reach out to a specific ancestor spirit ‚Äî maybe a deceased grandparent. Make sure you‚Äôre familiar with the etiquette for interacting with this type of spirit so you don‚Äôt accidentally do something disrespectful. (If your Grandma hated cussing, try not to drop any f-bombs while communing with her.)Create a special space to communicate with the spirit. This can be as simple as lighting a candle or as elaborate as setting up a special altar. If you‚Äôre reaching out to a grandparent, you might set up a small ritual space with a photo of them, any of their belongings that you have access to, and some things that they enjoyed while they were alive. These items may make the connection easier, but you don‚Äôt need them to communicate. What matters is that you‚Äôve taken the time to create a special space for this moment. (Like all ritual spaces, it should be clean and tidy, and it‚Äôs a good idea to do an energetic cleanse beforehand.)Make an offering. Make sure your offering is appropriate for the spirit you‚Äôre connecting to. Offerings should be made with an air of reverence ‚Äî don‚Äôt just toss a bag of Doritos on your altar and expect it to be well-received.Introduce yourself. Speak out loud. State your intention and who you are hoping to connect with.Wait and listen. You may feel a presence or receive some kind of sign ‚Äî or you may not. Just because you didn‚Äôt get a sign doesn‚Äôt mean that your offering wasn‚Äôt noticed or that you‚Äôre being ignored. You may also receive a sign several hours, days, or weeks after you first reach out. Be patient.Say your farewells. Express your gratitude for the spirit‚Äôs presence, and let them know that you are ending your little ritual. It‚Äôs up to you whether to invite them to stick around or politely tell them to leave, but if you‚Äôre going to give a spirit permission to linger in your home you better be 1000% sure you know who they are and what their intentions with you are.Moving ForwardAs you work with this spirit, it is important to establish clear boundaries for the relationship. Be clear about what you want to accomplish by working with them, and make sure you understand what they expect from you in return.You might want to establish a time limit: for example, maybe you‚Äôre choosing to work closely with the goddess Brigid from Imbolc to Samhain, at which point you can choose to continue the relationship or to take a step back. Or, you may choose to work with a spirit on a specific task ‚Äî for example, working with the goddess Aphrodite to get back on your feet and rebuild your self esteem after a breakup. Once this task is accomplished, you may choose to form a more long-term relationship or to take a step back.Forming a permanent or long-term working relationship with a spirit is a very big, very serious commitment, and should not be taken lightly. This goes double for anything involving a ritual commitment, such as dedication to a deity. When you make these commitments, you are choosing to make a spirit and their energy a permanent part of your life. This decision requires some very serious introspection and consideration, and should not be made impulsively.Resources:Southern Cunning: Folkloric Witchcraft in the American South by Aaron OberonA Practical Heathen‚Äôs Guide to Asatru by Patricia M.
