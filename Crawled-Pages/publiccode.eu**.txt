                    Public Code
  A campaign by 
            Why is software created using taxpayers’ money not released as Free Software?
            We want legislation requiring that publicly financed software developed for the public sector be made publicly available under a Free and Open Source Software licence. If it is public money, it should be public code as well.
            Code paid by the people should be available to the people!
                Sounds complicated? It's not. It's super easy!
                More advantages
                Reasons for Public Code
                    Tax savings
                    Similar applications don't have to be programmed from scratch every time.
                    Collaboration
                    Major projects can share expertise and costs.
                    Serving the public
                    Applications paid by the public should be available for everyone.
                    Fostering innovation
                    With transparent processes, others don't have to reinvent the wheel.
        Free Software gives everybody the right to use, study, share and improve software. This right helps support other fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press and privacy.
          Do you believe that Free Software should be the default option for publicly financed software? Let’s convince your political representatives!
