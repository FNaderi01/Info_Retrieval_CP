                            Fanfiction - Something Beautiful (Ficlet V)
                            This ficlet is a much deserved belated birthday present to the ever lovely @missclairebelle​. I love you loads, K! A heartfelt thank you to @veryfaintveryhuman​, whose recent comment on the last chapter of SB moved me to write again in this universe (that is the great power of generosity). This ficlet takes place immediately after Jamie and Claire’s wedding (honeymoon ficlet, y’all!!) and I hope you enjoy it. Let me know if you have other requests! XSomething Beautiful Arc I, Something Beautiful Arc IIFiclet I, Ficlet II, Ficlet III, Ficlet IVSomething BeautifulFiclet V – Half a MoonAfter
nineteen hours of traveling in commercial airplanes - including three layovers
(Aberdeen – Glasgow – Amsterdam – Abu Dhabi – Malé) -, followed by a
bumpy, sweaty and slightly terrifying trip on a light aircraft (a matchbox
for flying humans) and speed boat, it was hardly surprising that Jamie and
I kissed chastely on the lips before collapsing on the enormous bed of our
Maldivian honeymoon suite. Exhaustion had a way of knocking out sexiness, and
we had two weeks to enjoy being naked together in the sultry air. But my
slumber must have recognized the lingering tension of my body and the
expectations created by being a newly-married woman – amidst chaotic dreams of
bland airplane meals, arguments on the baggage claim desk and the immensity of
crushing blue surrounding me, I fantasized of being woken by the mouth of my
husband upon me and arriving at the lavish breakfast well loved. Thus, it was
somewhat disappointing when I opened my eyes to discover the plush pillow next
to mine empty of my favourite red mane. A note scribbled in Jamie’s jumbled
penmanship read “Went for a morning jog. Meet me at the beach, Mrs. Fraser?”I turned the
note several times on my hand, perplexed, half-expecting to find a “Got you,
Sassenach – meet me in the shower!”, but upon uncovering nothing else had
to admit defeat and drag my mildly annoyed arse to put on a bathing suit. Critically
examining my reflection over my shoulder, clad in a shiraz-red trikini, I
decided it was probably enough to ensure little time in public and our swift
return to our water villa. Carrying my light
beach bag and my straw sun hat, I padded across the long walkway which
connected the secluded water villas to the shore, where the main activities of
the resort were located. Before too long, I was settled on a sun lounger, thoroughly
smeared with fragrant sunscreen, like a buttered pale chicken ready to roast. It was still
fairly early, and my head was filled with a jetlag haze that made everything
watery and somewhat strange, so I napped on and off under the balmy influence
of the Maldivian sun as I waited for Jamie to return. Soon it became too hot (a
trickle of sweat defying my bellybutton in a nagging race) and I ventured
into the absurdly clear waters, discovering they were a far cry from the briskness
of Aberdeen’s ocean, like a liquid soup enriched by colourful schools of reef fishes
and corals. Lounging on
my chair again to dry, I noticed a couple of indiscreet young women giggling openly
near the beach bar, as they threw inquisitive and lewd glances towards
something on the far left. It was without any great surprise (but a definite
hint of pride and possessiveness) that I turned my head to realize Jamie
was running towards us.

                            Some stories find us exactly at the right time. The story of Duck and Sassenach found me when I needed
it the most and brought to me the kind of rare joy I will cherish forever. There’s
a different kind of power in telling a light, happy, story, that I truly enjoyed
discovering. While this arc closes today, I’m not saying goodbye – I intend to
visit them again, more than likely through ficlets, and I count on you to tell
me what you’d like to read as well. Thank you to all who read, supported,
commented and championed Duck as he fought to be with the girl of his
dreams and to make her absurdly happy. All my love, Kal. XSomething Beautiful Arc I, Ficlet I, Ficlet II, Ficlet III, Ficlet IVPart I, Part II, Part III, Part IV, Part V, Part VI, Part VII, Part VIII, Part IXSomething Beautiful IIPart X – Husband (II)JamieThe Red String of Fate.On
the last month of my solo travels, I had found myself in Japan, searching for
the peace of raining cherry blossoms, quiet temples and ancient tales of
unbreakable honour. There, I was told about the legend of an invisible red
thread, tied around the little finger by the gods, which connects those who are
destined to be together, regardless of time, place and circumstance. It is said
the Red String of Fate may stretch or
tangle, but it will never break.After
that occasion, I had decided to return to Scotland. To Claire.I
had long before realized my love for her would
never break or be tamed, no matter how many mountains I stretched that
thread across or how many deep oceans I submerged it in. Our thread was long
and unyielding, thickened by years of familiarity, connecting me to her
irreversibly. Only
many years later, I would start to believe she might feel the pull of that
thread too, tugging her ever closer (that
I, alone, possessed the other end). I
don’t think I’ve ever loved her as much as I did that night, as I saw her
walking towards me on the beach near our house, surrounded by a cloak of
darkness and stars. Even if her stunning wedding dress seemed somewhat
mismatched with knee-high Wellington boots, a long black parka coat and a set
of colourful mittens and beanie, I’d never seen her more striking.As
I watched her, the pad of my thumb pressed the cold metal of the wedding band
against my flesh for the umpteenth time, anchoring me to its realness. The now visible end of my thread. “Hiding
out here, are you?” Claire accused me amicably, before she plopped down
unceremoniously next to me, well within the merciful influence of a bonfire.
The dress’ fabric billowed around her, like a fallen cloud laying in the sand
for one night’s rest. “The party is still going strong. Mrs. Graham was
forming a conga line just before I escaped to find you. Tipsy people are
sleeping and cavorting everywhere in the house.”I
grunted, somewhat desperately. “I’m exhausted. Shouldn’t they be as
well?” She
sighed, fished inside her large right pocket and produced my Voldemort Funko
Pop keychain, dangling from her index finger. “If I wave this around,
do you think it will drive the message home?”

                            This is the first part of the last
chapter of Something Beautiful – it would be a beast for my standards, if I
posted it as one piece. I highly recommend listening to “She” by Elvis
Costello on repeat through this, because it’s quite perfect. I’ll save last
words for the final bit - but Jen, this one is for you. Something Beautiful Arc I, Ficlet I, Ficlet II, Ficlet III, Ficlet IVPart I, Part II, Part III, Part IV, Part V, Part VI, Part VII, Part VIIISomething Beautiful IIPart IX – Husband (I)On the eve of our wedding, I cut Jamie’s hair. We were alone at our house, finally finding a moment of precious
peace, since both our mothers had been appeased by all the completed
preparations, and retired for some much-needed rest before the big day  (“Must
look good for all the Insta stories I’ll be posting tomorrow”, my mum told
me before she happily sauntered towards my previous address - her current
kingdom -, her arm linked with Ellen’s).This time, I not only traced the small mole behind his ear with my
fingertips, but kissed it wholeheartedly, making him gasp (a shudder, the unspoken invitation of the tilt of his head). When I deemed myself content with my ministrations, he turned
quickly on the leather couch, pulling me from my advantageous position and
trapping my legs with his body with remarkable efficiency and finesse.
Wordlessly, he undid the belt of my robe and opened it languidly, as he gazed
into my eyes (a promise of dark desire,
of light through it). I wondered how many times he had stopped himself from
doing exactly that - ravishing me after I teased him mercilessly - over the
years of our friendship, which to him had been the longest courtship. His mouth was hot on my belly, and even hotter further down; I half-heartedly
protested that we should be keeping some form of celibacy as nuptial traditions
demanded, but his answer was to redouble his efforts and I said no more. We showered together, happiness coating our nakedness along with the
scent of soap (not citrus, nor floral,
but undoubtedly sweet), and afterwards we curled by the fire reading Sharp Objects together. When my phone rang, I jumped to get it
- I had been awaiting a call from my hairdresser to sort some last-minute details.
“Hello?” I smiled and nudged Jamie with my foot, as he
mockingly tried to bite my big toe over the edge of the book’s cover. “Ah,
Mister Jenkins, how are you? I wasn’t expecting a call from you today.” Mister Jenkins was the manager of our wedding venue, a
scrawny-looking Welshman that talked a storm. 
Usually his energy and optimism seemed endless, so as I heard the tone
of profound preoccupation and regret in his voice, my concern was immediate. An unexpected flood due to
last night’s storm, he informed, as my lips became
completely numb. The damage to the main
hall and equipment, as well as all the decorations, is too great, I heard
somewhere in the distance, the wedding
cannot take place tomorrow. My hand was shaking intensely as he said, I can rearrange things and should have
another opening for you in six months or so.Six months or so.

XSomething Beautiful Arc I, Ficlet I, Ficlet II, Ficlet III, Ficlet IVPart I, Part II, Part III, Part IV, Part V, Part VI, Part VIISomething Beautiful IIPart VIII – Flannel &amp;
LaceThere is something about wedding
planning that turns reasonable and considerate people into wankers, with a
tendency for cannibalization of their own kin. We didn’t want to wait too long, so Jamie and I were perfectly
content with the idea of a winter wedding. The first seven days of our
engagement were blissful, wrapped as we were in the shockproof cover of a
foreign country, rather like an undisturbed couple embracing inside a snow
globe.However, after our return to the reality of our common days, real life
insisted on being meddlesome. It started with Jamie being promoted at work. When he shared the
news upon arriving home, a grin so large on his face that I’d come to associate
mostly with wickedness between sheets, I’d arboured hope that it meant more
desk duties and less time soaking in waters hell-bent on killing him.I peppered him with kisses (“I’ll
allow for some well-deserved gloating now, Duck”), proud as if I had
trained him myself (industriously) to
become a legendary rescuer. Soon enough I’d realize it meant exactly the same physical hazards that
kept me awake at night in his absence, but longer hours doing bureaucratic work
and being even more involved in recruit training. That meant that a task devised for two committed partners quickly
became a source of lonesome frustration for me.We had just managed to select and book a venue for the wedding,
before things went completely mental. It was a small estate embedded within an
old forest leading to Aberdeen’s majestic shoreline, which combined enough
elements of our history and joint alchemy to feel like us. Even with that major decision laid to rest, there was still an
infinite list of tasks to be perused and accomplished, that I tried to handle (somewhat ungracefully) as best as I
could, although it made me feel like I was carrying the weight of a massive
block to build a revered pyramid all on my own. That particular week, we had vouched to take some serious “us” time, dealing with wedding cake
tasting, honeymoon debating and flower ogling (and subsequent sneezing and eye-watering). When I woke up with a
feeling of crushing dread one morning, only to receive a call from Jamie
telling me he had been chosen to do some interforce cooperation in the Bering sea for a couple of weeks (his voice sorrowful, but not entirely
capable of hiding a distinct sense of awe and excitement), I darkly
contemplated the yellow sapphire of my engagement ring for a few minutes and
dragged myself to a long shower. The manager of the venue (a stout woman with a vigorous taste for
expensive perfume) animatedly discussed the merits of lemon frosting versus
chocolate ganache, but I couldn’t concentrate enough to coax my tasting buds
into surrender. As I blindly glanced through the window, revealing leaden skies
and biblical rain - some part of me wondering if Jamie had touched down in
Alaska -, I distractedly speared and nibbled on a piece of the cake closer to
my elbow. The oily, rich and slightly smoky taste of nuts filled my mouth
instantly.

only real thing to exist, I opened my eyes to Jamie’s beautifully made back.
His hand, big and possessive, was
splayed on my hip as his powerful arm stretched back; by his breathing, I knew
he was awake too.“It’s real, then?” I demanded, my voice croaky and mellow, mostly
from cries that only the pillow underneath me would ever confess. “I really asked
– and you said yes?”Jamie rolled to face me, his thigh edging between my knees in unspoken
familiarity. “Ye were stark naked.” He pointed practically. His own
voice was unhinged, like a deep cave echoing a million whispers of yearning and
abandon. “I didna see that I had much choice, aye?”I slapped him half-heartedly, a movement that turned into an almost
brusque caress on his pectoralis, as if there was no other true way to
touch him if not in desire. “Glad I made such a compelling case, Duck. I
can get into a fugly jumper and sweatpants, if you want to reconsider without
further distractions.”“Nah.” He smirked lazily and bent his head to apply a well-measured
kiss on my left breast, with just enough persistence to make me gasp aloud. “I
already ken what’s underneath, so not a real chance of not being distracted.”
The palm of his hand touched my cheek and he gazed at me tenderly. “I’ll say “yes”
everyday until ye meet me at the altar, mo nighean donn.”“Good.” I hawked, inefficiently trying to dissipate the
renewed wave of emotion breaking on the rocks of my chest, where Jamie always
walked on the shores of my thoughts and swam in the waves of my daydreams. “We
were rather busy yesterday,“ A foolish blush was seizing my fair skin, a
belated reverberation of the insatiable movements of our bodies the previous
night, eager to pledge themselves definitively to one another. “But I have
something to give you. While it didn’t seem appropriate to give an engagement
ring to a man, I still wanted you to have something – a token, to
symbolize our commitment.”As Jamie watched me, with awe and surprise in his fathomless blue
eyes, I jumped from the bed and dashed to my handbag, discarded on the floor
close to the open balcony doors of our quaint hotel room.  Bellow, the Hallstatt Lake dawned like
liquid mercury, silver with faint tinges of heated orange, and the breeze was akin
to a snuggling cat, lazy and charming. When I returned to Jamie’s side, an elegant box coated in black
leather and shaped like a cube was nestled in my hands. I sat with my legs
folded in front of my boyfriend, covered only by the whiteness of a sheet, and
placed it silently on his lap.

                            Fanfiction - Something Beautiful II
                            This chapter was the first thing that took shape in my mind for Arc II. It was greatly (and shamelessly) inspired by my time in Austria early this summer. I so hope you enjoy this Jamie POV. ❤Something Beautiful Arc I, Ficlet I, Ficlet II, Ficlet III, Ficlet IVPart I, Part II, Part III, Part IV, Part VSomething Beautiful IIPart VI – Skinny-dipping JamieWhen my life would come to an end, what would be in that kaleidoscopic
film playing incessantly on my mind, that summary meant to show the substance of
my existence?Her face glaring at me curiously when I came out of that pool. The
way we raced through the airport terminal, because I was late from all those
carefully avoided farewells, her tears suspended on the air. That small eternity
when I thought I was going to die from a hammering heart and instead I kissed
her. The delicate and moving feel of her skin against mine when I circled her, knowing
it to be her way to surrender. How she kneeled in front of me for the first
time and I thought I’d lose myself like an inexperienced wean, just from the knowledge
of her desire upon me. Her naked morning-star shoulder blades, beautifully-made,
as she entered that lake ahead of me. But also, the day I realized those things might never come to pass.I had been sleeping fitfully. It’s hard to find good rest when someone
else shares the inside of yer head, carelessly banging doors and peeking inside
your carefully closed drawers. Claire had taken residence there for over six
months and that neighbouring relationship was getting increasingly more difficult
to play with any degree of coolness – I had been cooking up a confession,
mainly because I feared I’d go absolutely whacky from unspoken love.“I’ll just go there right now.” I exhaled, studying my own bewildered
reflection on the mirror of my room close to the university, feeling more than
a little chunderous. On the background, The Temptations crooned about “What
can make me feel this way? My girl (my girl, my girl)”. “And tell her.
Straight out wi’ it. Nothing more, Fraser. Huh, right now.”I mussed up my damp hair in nervousness, picking up and putting down
objects before I could realize what I intended to do with them. I grabbed my backpack
(completely forgetting to place my training kit inside) and headed outside,
with a confidence that was entirely faked. I was already five-hundred yards
away from the dorm, when I realized I was donning unmatched socks, one emerald green
and the other coloured like terracotta.“Shite.” I grunted between teeth, before running back to
change. Most of that small itinerary was spent babbling to myself (“Blimey,
what am I even going to tell her?” I scratched my uneven stubble in impatience.
“Hey lass, are ye into time travelling? Because I see ye in my future.” A
mortified moan escaped my lips. “Why would I let myself out of the house? I’m
hopeless.)”After an hour in which I abandoned and returned to my small flat
more than half a dozen times, I had finally made my way to Claire’s apartment
building, where she and Geillis dwelled. “Hey Claire.” I trained in a
casual low voice, trying to sound mature and interesting (and like I fuckin’ had
it together). “I think ye should know that I – I-“

last visit pre-dating our romantic relationship. Both with insanely demanding
careers, it wasn’t always easy to find the available time and spare energy to
take the drive further up north, deep into the Highlands, for a quick gathering
and family lunch. Overflowing with enviable energy, Ellen made regular visits
to Aberdeen in order to spend a weekend reconnecting with her only surviving son,
also enjoying the occasion to catch up with my mother (her bestie) whenever
she was in town. After Jamie’s return from Dorset, we had finally found our way to
the estate to spend a long weekend walking the breathtaking countryside, eating
far too much from the lavish lunch table and fuelling our hearts with the
stories and laughter of our family. And so I found myself unpacking my small holiday
bag (searching for a cute sweater to wear for dinner) in such a familiar place
again.The room was filled with remarkable memorabilia – photographs;
diving trophies and medals (most for champion, of course); law tomes which
had survived Jamie’s thorough purge after he resigned college; vivid postcards
collected in his wanderings around the world; a couple of quaint art pieces made
of wood and shells, acquired in said travels. At a closer inspection, I
realized a lot of Jamie’s most cherished memories involved me (revolved
around me) – there I was on his nightstand, giggling and making faces next
to him, immortalized in a string of cheap shots from a photo boot in London,
where we went to celebrate my graduation from Medical School. “Ye look bonny in this room.” Jamie smiled at me from the bed where
he was perched, watching as I tried to decide between a blue cashmere sweater
and a white woollen cardigan. “Although I dinna support this notion of you
searching for even more clothes to wear. Just more work for me to do later.”
I grinned and walked to the bed, slumping on it beside him. The idea
of making love to Jamie for the first time between these walls left me somewhat
breathless, as if we were still teenagers going against an imposed curfew to
meet for a risky experiment of tongue-kissing and fingering in a quiet corner.
The bed was remarkably narrow, since he had towered above most men since
puberty – I imagined I would just fall asleep with my body still on top of his,
after we were both sated from that terrible thirst, in which we tried to drink
each other but found only salted water (an initial relief, followed by an
even more pressing urgency, never quite mitigated).“Do you remember when we came for Jenny’s wedding, Duck?” I asked
him, leaning against the curve of his shoulder. “The house was bursting at the
seams with people, so I stayed with you – we slept together here.”

                            Not safe for work, church, drinking hot tea or reading in the same room as family members (if everything works out as intended). Much love to you all. XSomething Beautiful Arc I, Ficlet I, Ficlet II, Ficlet III, Ficlet IVPart I, Part II, Part IIISomething Beautiful IIPart IV – BrunchJamie had been absent for a week, called away by his only mistress (duty),
to teach a course at Dorset’s HM Coastguard Academy. During that time of
forced longing, I was able to carefully determine what I missed the most about
him. There was the singular skill he possessed to take the piss out of
me, without ever being hurtful or callous – like the day he discovered an
old Care Bear costume (pink, fluffy, terribly embarrassing),
mistakenly placed inside one of the several card boxes I dispatched to his
place, when I moved in (I chased him around the house brandishing a pillow,
while he laughed sidesplittingly and called me Claire-Bear).There was also the gentle and mindful way he battled his single-caveman-for-so-long
instincts, making a concerted effort to pay attention to the details that irked
me or were significant to me - a preventive fold on the end of the duct tape,
to keep me from going ballistic trying to blindly find it with a stressed
fingernail; the soothing and low tone, akin to that of a professional
psychotherapist, he used to address me before I had my first cup of coffee in a
morning after a strenuous string of shifts; the music I enjoyed playing in the
background when cooking together, bare-footed and complicit in the kitchen,
butting our hips to the rhythm of the song; my quirky Sheldon-Cooper-like
trait of having a favourite (unchallenged, except for Adso) place on our now
shared couch. Those small loyalties were the declarations of love he never failed
to make me.There was the soft whimper he made when I quickly pulled the covers
to lie down next to him in darkness, coming home from the hospital - a slightly
grumpy sound, that was always followed by a long relieved sigh, when his hands
found natural purchase on my arse or flat low stomach. But the thing I missed the most about him was the way our
mouths didn’t quite fit when I surprised him with a kiss amidst laughter, my
lips against the scrape of his teeth, uncovered by the exposed shelter of his staggered
mouth. That edge-filled happiness, in lieu of a perfectly round and composed
thing (drool-free, painless without the clash of unprepared gums,
camera-ready), was my favourite way to taste him. Of course, there were other things I yearned for in his absence.
Jamie was generous with his touch, seeking me often for a brush of fingertips
or a tender kiss in whatever skin he could reach. It wasn’t always something
primal and carnal between us (although it was that, too) - he was a
master of gentleness and timing, understanding when I needed my body to be
roused by a knowing hand and when I needed my spirit softly caressed. While sex
had been a part of the human experience I deeply appreciated since my
adolescent years, with Jamie it acquired breadth, like some cartesian two-dimensional
diagram suddenly building up to a complete sphere. The knowledge attentively
gardened by him throughout years of friendship had translated into an uncanny
capacity to disassemble me, either with a swift movement of hips when he was already
deep into me or by not moving at all and just waiting for me to meet him
halfway.

                            Duck and Sassenach are back!!! Thank you @notevenjokingfic and @balfeheughlywed, the masterminds behind this amazing challenge that has already given us so much. My blessings forever upon @holdhertightandsayhername, for listening to me freaking out over this non-stop. My quote: 
“I know what ye meant, Sassenach.” He said, turning his head to look up at me. “Never worry, the six inches that are left are all between my legs.”Chapters and FicletsSomething BeautifulFiclet IV – Sun-kissedWhile Jamie and I had
spent several holidays together, both in Scotland and abroad, the novelty of
packing up a bag with contents meant to be seen by my lover during a week in
the sun (relaxed, playful, unhurried) was inebriating. This time around
we’d be sharing a bed and all the activities that went with it; even my
practical and laid-back nature couldn’t resist a sneaky trip downtown to
acquire a few handpicked new bikinis, flowy sundresses and luxurious undergarments.The business of
deciding a destination hadn’t been seamless; our new life together seemed to
expand with possibilities, an open-spaced house without constraining walls to
bump upon, and we were starved to experience everything, all at once.
Jamie suggested a snowtrip, talking in that spellbinding lilt about physical
exertion on the ski slopes, followed by cosy fires at the lodge and mulled wine
we could sip from each other’s lips. Even if the concept was undeniably
appealing, my clumsy nature and patent lack of bodily coordination, quickly
made work of discouraging me. “I’ll end up with a
bloody hip fracture.” I protested, scrunching my nose. “And we will be doomed
to several weeks – maybe even months – of a remarkably unimaginative sex
life, with a lot of physical therapy to cope with.” I tapped my naked hip with
a dry snap, enhancing how I would be unable to rotate it in any significative
way. “Unless you’re really adamant on beginning our practice early for our
freaky eighties, let’s not.”Jamie, irritatingly
prone to all sports and physical prowess, clicked his tongue in disappointment
– but undoubtedly his horror of being condemned to perform an adaptation of the
missionary position in perpetuity crushed any further protests. We quickly
agreed on a sunny destination, where we could stroll ancient streets filled
with golden sunlight hand in hand, and lounge at the beach with an unlimited
supply of an alcoholic beverage of our choice. After some detailed Google
Maps scouting; careful exploration of flights (too expensive, too long,
too many layovers) and resorts; and a heated debate on budget and time
period for our escapade, we giggled our way through the booking of a one-week
vacation in Malta - like two teenagers, planning a much-anticipated shag on a
folded blanket on the back of a pickup truck, loaned from a complacent uncle.On the eve of our
trip I barely slept, excitement like a liquid thing filling every indent with a
vibrant orange energy. Jamie, a firm believer of the sacred nature of sleeping
whenever you had the chance, softly snored beside me unfazed, his regular
breath against the curve of my neck making me dream of the warm breeze by the
Mediterranean Sea.Our flight landed in La
Valletta, Malta’s quirky capital, around lunchtime. We pushed through the
crowds at the small airport to swiftly retrieve our luggage, Jamie particularly
eager to stretch his legs after being crammed in his seat like a reluctant yoga
practitioner; the narrow aircraft clearly hadn’t been built to accommodate the
progeny of Viking blood (“My bahoochie is that numb, Sassenach”).

                            three-drink-amy:Claire and Jamie have been best friends since they met at university. When Claire decided to leave medical school to pursue her dreams, Jamie was the first to support her. Five years later, they’re still best friends. But two conflicts stand poised to hurt their friendship: Jamie’s stake in her business and Claire’s secret enduring love for him. Chapter OneThe bell dinged, signaling the arrival of a late customer. Claire rolled her eyes, wishing more than anything that she could close the store and get home quickly. She plastered on a fake smile and walked out to greet the new guest. A sigh of relief echoed through the mostly empty room when she saw who it was. “Oh thank god, it’s just you.” “Just me?” Jamie teased. “I’m so flattered, Sassenach.”Claire scoffed, walking past him to turn the “Open” sign to “Closed.” “You know what I mean. I was afraid it was the type of person who comes in two minutes before closing time and wants the world.” “Jerks.” Claire paused and watched Jamie for a moment. “Yes, in fact, they are.” She started walking back behind the counter and into the kitchen. “Come on. If you’re here, you might as well help me.” Jamie shrugged. “Very well.” He rolled back the sleeves of his button down shirt and prepared himself to help Claire close down the bakery. She’d allowed most of the employees to leave a few minutes earlier. On days like that day, she liked to take the time to close things down on her own. It reminded her of how it was in the beginning. It had been 5 years since she opened her bakery, Sassenach Sweets. The name had been inspired by Jamie’s nickname for her. Really, it was a way to thank him. She had been in the trenches of medical school and hating it. After many tearful conversations over pizza and beer, Jamie told Claire to pursue her dreams and do what she really wanted to do. And what she really wanted to do was bake. Knowing she could never own her own bakery, Claire gave up hope pretty quickly. But fate, and then Jamie, had other plans. He’d been on a spur of the moment trip with his brother-in-law to New York City when he bought a lottery ticket as a joke and then won. 3.5 million dollars had completely changed Jamie’s life.
