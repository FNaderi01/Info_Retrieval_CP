    Summary
      While trying to jump across dimensions, Five Hargreeves gets “Fractured”, a rare side effect of frequent time travel that splits the host into fragments of a full person that need to be put back together like a sad puzzle. If the traveller was lucky, they would split into a couple of parts; they might even be able to put themselves back together as quickly as it happens, avoiding all the emotional moments and touchy subjects that follow.Of course, Five was never that lucky. He gets split into too many pieces and it's up to the rest of the Umbrella Academy to put him back together.

    Summary
      Five decided it was one of those “good news, bad news” situations. The good news was that the Hargreeves had made it back to 2019. The bad news was that there were now six dangerous strangers in their home. The worst news was the strange way Reginald was staring at Five.--- Set Post S2, the siblings are stuck in an alternate version of 2019, where the Umbrella Academy doesn’t exist. Five is mostly trying to avoid dealing with the trauma of watching his siblings die for the third time while trying to keep his family safe from Reggie and the Sparrow Academy.  The others, well…at least they’re trying.

      After narrowly subverting the apocalypse, life returns to normal for the Hargreeves family. Unfortunately, this peace doesn't last long after Five follows Diego on a routine night mission that goes sideways in the worst way. The dysfunctional super siblings must now work as a team to try and put the pieces of their smallest member back together before he shatters completely beyond repair.

    Summary
      “No one leaves until we figure this out,” Five snapped. 
Wordlessly, Luther grabbed him by the fabric of his sweater and blazer. He lifted his brother off his feet as if he weighed nothing and threw him sideways, tossed him over the side of the balcony. It happened so quickly that nobody moved to stop him- and maybe they wouldn't have anyway. They'd grown up with superpowers, pitted against each other in training sessions by their father, so they were all pretty accustomed to roughhousing. Knives were thrown as often as insults. They all knew Five was way too agile to be hurt so easily. 
More irritated than worried, Diego watched from the stairs as his older brother flew through the air in a perfect arch and then plummeted towards the ground. He knew that Five would just jump out of the way and reappear somewhere else- probably out in the alley, so that he could work off some steam. He always jumped out of the way, even before he'd fully mastered his power. Teleporting seemed instinctual to Five. So, Diego was stunned to watch as the boy just sunk like a stone in water.
There was a thump, followed by the sharp cracking of bone, as his body hit the floor of the shop.

    Summary
      Three days before the Apocalypse, a Temps Commission worker fails to check in his briefcase. As a result, it is left on Earth when humanity is wiped out. Less than a year later, the briefcase is discovered by a lone time traveler and is used to make an unregistered trip back to the 24th March 2019. Five lands in the living room of the Hargreeves mansion minutes before his father's memorial, seven months after being trapped in the Apocalypse.
