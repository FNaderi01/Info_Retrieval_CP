    Summary
      The Dark Lord wanted a consort and had decided to host a competition that involved nearly everyone in Britain. If they thought they were good enough, they could enter to compete in a certain amount of tasks set by the Lord of the lands himself. Only the victor would have the skills necessary to become Voldemort's consort. Harry unfortunately nabs the Dark Lord's attention. Voldemort does as he pleases.Hermione enters to win, Bellatrix takes interest in certain people, and of course there's the villain causing trouble.A/N: SLASH/Harrymort/AU. I'm still waiting for someone to tell me exactly how this sounds like Harry is a slave. Please do so. Nothing at all would suggest it. How about we don't assume that because the word "consort" is involved, it must *obviously* be about slavery. Does anyone actually know what a consort is?

    Summary
      There is a tower, they say, with hushed voices and eyes full of fear. There is a tower that is taller than the tallest trees, higher than the highest mountains. It houses treasures unknown, guarded by a fearsome dragon that rests at the very top.If one tries to slay the dragon, they say, they will be met by a golden man with powers unheard of, a swordmaster dressed in all black, and a dark elf that resembles the late king of Roan. No one can defeat them, let alone the dragon that simply watches.Don’t go near the tower, they warn. For you may never come back.

    Creator Chose Not To Use Archive WarningsKim Dokja/Yoo JonghyukKim Dokja Yoo JonghyukAlternate Universe - Fantasy Kinda grim reaper!kdj dead soul!yjh Fluff Angst no happy ending Bad Ending Suicide i made myself emo with this
    Summary
  Kim Dokja had to admit, he was definitely starting to get attached. Warning bells had started going off in his head a while ago telling him that this was all wrong and that he had to stop before things escalated any further. His instincts were screaming at him – that this was forbidden and that he was in danger. But somehow, despite the grating noises inside his head, he found himself deaf to it all.
  I’m just doing my job and trying to guide him to the afterlife, he convinced himself again and again. He didn’t know how much longer he could carry out that lie.
AU in which Kim Dokja is a grim reaper and Yoo Jonghyuk is the next soul he has to guide to the afterlife.

    Summary
      Yoo Jonghyuk made a promise to his sister before he left home to become a Pokemon Master - that he would not go picking fights with people and settle it with proper Pokemon battles instead.
In his defence, he thought as he contemplated the bodies of several kids only a year older than him, they picked on him first.
Yes. He didn't start this fight at all.
...Hey, who was this random kid?
