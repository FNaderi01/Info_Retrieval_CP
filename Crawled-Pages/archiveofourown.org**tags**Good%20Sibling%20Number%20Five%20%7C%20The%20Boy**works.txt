    Summary
      There was a distinctly annoyed and horribly familiar huff behind him. "What a ridiculous waste of time. It is a Friday night, you should be honing your powers, Number Four."And. Klaus. Froze.He felt his shoulders bunch up, all his muscles tensing at the sound of his voice. He squeezed his eyes shut, hoping that he imagined it. But no."I am well-aware that you can hear me, Number Four. Or is this some extension of your irrational fear of the dead? I would've expected you to have moved past that by now, but you always were the weakest of your siblings."---In which Reginald Hargreeves comes back as a ghost and Klaus is left to deal with the fallout.

    Summary
      Wherein Klaus is alone until he isn't, his siblings are trying their best, the apocalypse doesn't happen, and maybe, just maybe, they can all find a little peace.***Dave is blindingly bright and so very good, and if life has taught Klaus anything, it’s that he doesn’t deserve good things.(He learned that the first time dad had shoved him into an icy mausoleum. He learned that when Luther grinned and taunted Klaus when his jaw was wired shut for eight weeks, as if it was a blessing that their brother couldn’t open his mouth, screams trapped behind clenched teeth as cold dead hands reached for him, always trying to take take take. He learned that when he woke up from his first overdose in the hospital with Diego at his bedside, looking pissed and worried but alone, and he learned it his second, his third, his eighth, when even Diego stopped coming. He learned that when weed was the only thing that kept the ghosts at bay, when that stopped working and then it was only narcotics, and then it was only crack, and then heroin, and then and then and then-) (Klaus isn’t bitter and sad, not at all).(His legal Name is still Number Four).***Standalone fic!

    Summary
      The apocalypse was successfully avoided.With their house still standing, nothing kept them from going on with their lives. As Allison began her road to recovery and Vanya her much needed training, everything finally seemed to slip into place.But the Umbrella Academy had always been some sort of danger magnet, so of course the easy life didn't last that long. Unfortunately, this time they didn’t have a long lost sibling fall out of the sky to inform them of the impending doom. But with Vanya in safe hands, what could be the cause this time? Was it finally time to face an enemy or problem outside of the family? Or had Reginald screwed up somewhere once again?Maybe the Commission had been right all along; What’s meant to be is meant to be. ((Takes place around season 1))

    Summary
      Set on episode 6 of season 2, in the family meeting. Klaus gets possessed by Ben but it turns out a little bit more dramatic than that. Nobody cared when he fell to the floor after what seemed a desperate attempt to gain attention, but they didn't expect for him to start seizing uncontrollably before their paralized gazes.I know, I suck at summaries. :D Hope you like it.

      It sort of hit him all at once but also hit him in stages. Maybe it was days, maybe it was weeks, it could have been months but what is time. Five would know the answer to this question but he wasn’t sure where he was.

    Summary
      Five didn’t recognise it, it certainly wasn’t in the house. The garden- no- what was that big stone building at the bottom of it though? Five wracked his brain, he hadn’t been down there in literal decades, had forgotten it even existed. God, Klaus was so little, but his wails were echoing loudly off the walls, clearly utterly distraught. Five’s chest was burning just watching it.The mausoleum. That big, stone tomb full of god knows who, sitting dauntingly at the end of the garden. He swallowed thickly, forcing himself to watch more, to figure it out. That’s what he did, that’s what he always did.

    Summary
      It’s a well known fact that Klaus doesn’t know how to drive and since Diego adamantly refuses to get into another vehicle with him after the ice-cream truck incident, Five decides it’s up to him to teach Klaus. Based off of Five saying “I’m the daddy here!” in Season 2. Not Season 2 compliant though.

    Summary
      Wherein Klaus finally gets his happy ending.***Klaus remembers the first time he met Dave. He remembers fear closing off his airway; he remembers the harsh rattle of gunfire, the ground trembling with the force of nearby explosives, the throbbing ache that clung to his very bones. He remembers the confusion and the panic as he was shouted at, dazed and hurting, until a pair of pants was shoved into his hands and a helmet onto his head; he remembers hours of trekking through damp, hot rainforest in pitch darkness, clutching that stupid fucking briefcase to his chest. He remembers the second time he met him, too, or maybe just the official time. He remembers clear blue eyes and freckles dotting sun-kissed cheeks; he remembers golden curls plastered against sweat soaked skin, and a warm hand settling firmly in his own, and he remembers “shit’s crazy, I know. Don’t worry, you’ll adjust.”He remembers a warm, genuine smile, and the way Dave’s hand lingered just a little too long in his own.

    Summary
      Wherein there's some good, old fashioned brotherly bonding (with a little bit of angst peppered in for flavor).***Five is silent, still staring at him, and Klaus winds his arms around himself, shoulders hunching under the scrutiny, feeling undeniably like he’s just said something wrong. But then Five is lurching forward, pulling him clumsily against his chest and Klaus just- freezes. Because this is the second time in as many months that Five has hugged him, and Klaus just- he misses it. He’s always been tactile and his siblings, while always willing to tolerate it with nothing more dramatic than an eye roll, are never the ones to initiate it, and he hasn’t realized how much he’s wanted that until, well, now.

    Summary
      “I want to know what the hell happened in there? Who was that? Why were you in the mausoleum in the first place?” Five fired off one after the after, gaze hard as he set his mug down with a thud. Klaus sighed, leaning his head back, feeling somewhat responsible to give Five an answer to what he walked into. What he walked into bloody actually, Klaus couldn’t forget that.“You can’t just swan in here looking like you took a day trip to the slaughterhouse and demand answers like that.” He said, somewhat smugly as he took another sip, knowing he had Five trapped there. Five wasn’t getting answers out of him unless he gave some up himself first, and he’d never do that. If he was being honest, Klaus still didn’t really know anything about his brother after he’d left. All those years completely blank. That definitely wasn’t fair, Five got to read about Klaus’s ever continuing list of fuck ups before he’d even done them. Perks of the future and all.

    Summary
      Wherein Five and Klaus's conversation lasts a little bit longer, and Five takes his role as little big brother seriously. ***“I love him, Five. I love him and- a-and...” “And he’s gone anyways,” Five finished softly. Klaus couldn’t find the words to explain, couldn’t find the strength to say them out loud, couldn’t get them out past the tears even if he wanted to, but Five was always the smartest, and he doesn't need Klaus to say anything at all.“You love him,” Five says, voice incredulous as he repeats. “And he’s gone anyways. You love him, and you think that’s why he’s gone. Because you went and loved him at all.”***(Title change- previously called ‘all the missing pieces of my heart (they finally collide)’)

    Summary
      “Besides, as I said earlier, Luther is capable of defending himself,” Five adds. “This is Number One we’re talking about. There are very few people on this planet who aren’t able to be crushed with his fists.”
“You think I don’t know that?” Klaus snaps, and it’s not until Five’s eyes narrow and Diego’s eyebrows furrow that he realizes he’s said too much.
