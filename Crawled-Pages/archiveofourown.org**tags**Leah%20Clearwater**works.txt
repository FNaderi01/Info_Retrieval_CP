    Summary
      Jacob may have imprinted on Renesmee when she was born, but that doesn't automatically mean the two will one day be romantically involved. Each needs to figure out themselves before they can find love together. Life is a journey and this follows them down the path to the final destination of the other, with all the inevitable pit stops along the way. Sequel to I Thought I Knew.

    Summary
      Two years ago Alexandra Clarke moved to the small and under-appreciated town of Forks to live with her father for the first time since her mother's death. Slowly but surely the place started to win its way into her heart (not that she'd ever admit to it) but everything is thrown off balance after the arrival of her slightly-estranged half-sister Isabella Swan.Thanks to her sister, and some incredible chance encounters, Alex finds herself thrust into an entirely different world... a world of magic and monsters right on her doorstep. With this new life comes some of the most incredible people she has ever met, but also some of the most dangerous. Alex Clarke never wanted to be a target, or a victim, or a hero of any sort.All she ever wanted to be was more than 'the other sister'.And to Paul Lahote she is... she's absolutely everything.

    Summary
      Peter really regrets allowing Tony to convince him to go on this stupid mission. Going undercover sounded like a cool idea at first. Going undercover in a tiny, barely-there town in the middle of Washington sounded a little less cool, but who was he to be picky about it? Turns out, he should have been picky about it.
OR
When a string of violent murders breaks out in Port Angeles, the Cullens and the Pack are concerned, Tony is sent to investigate, and Peter is just tagging along for the ride. However, nobody expected for things to get this out of hand.

    Summary
      It's been 6 years since Bella ran off with the Cullens. Jacob had been sure she was dead, or at the very least she was an undead leech. Yet here she was, or rather...here he was. How will they deal with how each of them have changed? Is forgiveness possible after so much time and pain? This isn't typical J/B. AU.

    Summary
      Sam may have—he may have cheated and broken their engagement, but she still had her parents and Seth and they were what mattered. “You’re right, you’re—oh my god that asshole has my cat still.” She had left the house in a hurry and hadn’t even grabbed any of her belongings when she stormed off. Most of her clothes, her college textbooks, her cat was still in his house. Leah groaned and shook her head.“Let’s steal your cat.” Seth said quietly.“Let’s steal my cat!” Leah yelled back.
