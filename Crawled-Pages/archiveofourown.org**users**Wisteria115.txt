    Summary
      Five decided it was one of those “good news, bad news” situations. The good news was that the Hargreeves had made it back to 2019. The bad news was that there were now six dangerous strangers in their home. The worst news was the strange way Reginald was staring at Five.--- Set Post S2, the siblings are stuck in an alternate version of 2019, where the Umbrella Academy doesn’t exist. Five is mostly trying to avoid dealing with the trauma of watching his siblings die for the third time while trying to keep his family safe from Reggie and the Sparrow Academy.  The others, well…at least they’re trying.

So I'm gonna give it to her Fluff A helping of angst too Father-Daughter Relationship Father-Son Relationship Brother-Sister Relationships POV Multiple POV Third Person Castiel is Magda Peterson's parent Castiel is Jack Kline's Parent Co-Parenting Powers!Sam Winchester
    Summary
      Magda hadn't had a family in a long time, she lost her mother, brother and father the second she turned 15 and the devil had come to her. But as she travels down these roads with Sam, Dean and Castiel she finally remembers what it was like. 
He hadn't expected anything from saving Magda from her horrible mother. But he finds, that of all the messed up things Chuck had thrown at him all these years. His children were the best. 
Jack had always thought that Castiel would be his father, at least that's what his mother had said but things rarely ever work out, especially for a Winchester. But this time. Chuck was good.

    Summary
      There’s a lump in Klaus’ throat, one that won’t go away no matter how hard he swallows, and he realizes right now he could tell them everything. He could tell them about the harsh words, about the possession, when Ben broke his rules and almost did unthinkable things with his body, refusing to leave even when Klaus was sitting in the corner of his own mind, helpless, begging to be freed.
But what good would that do? He doubts his siblings would even believe him, but on the off chance they did, that would just destroy the only comforting image of their dead brother that they have. They don’t need to know Klaus’ version of Ben—he can’t do that to them. 
So he'll give them a version they can picture in their minds and still smile fondly at.
