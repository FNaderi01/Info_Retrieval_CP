                  thehugwizard:lovelesssupremeshirts:realkremlinhours:realkremlinhours:animeismybestfriend104:marxism-sjwism:btw… important PSA: cutting off the mold on the surface of food does nothing. you can only see the spores on the surface, but mold itself has spread and grown roots into the food. by the time you can actually *see* the spores, that piece of food is completely full of it. youre still eating mold. many of which are poisonous and have been shown to cause cancer. youre not even supposed to sniff it, because that can get spores into your lungs. like if you look up the health and safety guidelines for mold they barely stop short of telling you to put on a hazmat suit. like produce is okay as long as you cut around it at least an inch, but cooked foods? you gonna die. stop eating mold people does that include breadyesHere’s the USDA mold chartVERY IMPORTANT INFO FRIENDOS!!!!!!!!!!!!(via sarah-lou-who)

                  sketiana:hate it when im reading abt a poet/writer/artists sayin we shouldnt let societal pressure form too much of our outward expression of our true inner self n how life is too short to succumb to the pressure of the many to act and behave in a way that deep on the inside makes us unhappy n then find out they were just talking abt wanting to freely be a fucking pedophile

The sound of whispering makes me want to claw my face off.(via gorkipelin)
