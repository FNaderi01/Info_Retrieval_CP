anonymous asked:Could you maybe show us an evolution of your drawings? (Even before this blog?) I love the fact that you are self-taught. I'm not good at drawing but I would love to give it a go, but I would appreciate some motivation by seeing your evolution (if you don't mind)? Big fan! x Well, basically all digital art that I’ve drawn is posted on this blog, or at least on my dA account :) Although I did delete a few! So I guess I can bring them back… *cringe*Okay so… In 2015 I got really into Harry Potter and was inspired by all those fanartists, so I tried drawing some stuff of my own. I didn’t have a tablet yet, I was just trying the waters, seeing if digital art is even something I’d be interested in. Here are Hermione and Draco’s portraits I did in mid-November 2015 (I think I was drawing with my mouse, or I might have been using a touch pen on my Asus laptop that has a touch screen, but it’s very tough to work with, not like a tablet at all, no pressure sensitivity, no precision)Ugh the cringe…. :DI mean if you scroll to the very bottom of my dA page you’ll find more stuff like this, if you’re interested.But yeah, those portraits are pretty much the first digital drawings I’ve done.Continuing with portraits, 4 months later (mid-March 2016) I did Hermione and Draco again, this time already using my graphic tablet and also using references:Already much better! Yet, to me, still cringy :D I haven’t yet redrawin these portraits (I am planning to), but if we look at my newest portraits (from Ravenclaw set since that one’s the latest, it was completed in February 2017 which is almost a year later from the previous ones), you can see that I have improved a lot too!They look so much cleaner, every brushstroke has much more purpose, there’s more symmetry and logic and all those things. I like how my portraits changed, not sure how others feel :)The biggest change in my art was me starting to use references. It helps so much with getting proportions and perspective and body movements right.And then it was just all about continuing to learn and polishing my style through practice and frequent drawing :) As I did more and more portraits, it sort of felt as though I’ve always been doing them the same way, as though my portraits look the same and no progress is done, but as you can see, during one year, the way I draw changed, or rather got a bit better and precise, so while it didn’t feel as though I’m improving as I’m drawing, when looking back, the progress is visible.So just take your time :) Miracles won’t happen in a short period of time, especially if you don’t draw at least a couple of times a week (last year in spring-summer I drew like 5-12 drawings a week, so that totally made a difference). You will improve, I promise, but looking at other artists’ art, trying to figure out how they did it, trying out different tools, and learning from references will surely speed up the process of making progress. So yeah, I hope this helps a little :) Sorry I only showed portraits here, I just thought they’re good to show art evolution with since I drew so many of them. Good luck mate! &lt;3

anonymous asked:You know what i love most about your nsfw art? You make sex so beautiful and natural and loving, even when it's downright kinky and filthy as well. You normalise the raw, primal side of sex in this really beautiful way that i think encourages people to explore what they like and to recognize what they don't without ever overstepping uncomfortable boundaries. Thank you for your beautiful drawings ❤DUDEThis message is the best thing!!! You have no idea how much I want my art to represent the things you describe it as, so I could not feel happier and more accomplished!! Thank you for looking at my art with such a wonderful perspective! &lt;3

womenwoods  asked:I saw you described the picture you edited of Pavel Baranov as your real-life Draco, are there any other people you see as the real-life version of the other characters?Well, no real person is a
perfect representation of any of the characters, but I suppose there are some closely-resembling people that, if you change a few details about them, WOULD then become some HP character in my head. And I usually use such people as references, so I guess I can give you my list of those? :)(and I hope you don’t mind me sharing your ask with everyone! &lt;3) Keep reading

anonymous asked:Why don't you do requests? I think that fan art isn't something that should be charged to get, but that's my opinion. Your artwork is good but there's so many people including myself who have no talent and want people to draw something for them but then get sad when they find out they have to pay twenty bucks for it. It just makes me kinda sad, I guessTL;DR:Look at it this way (not a perfect parallel but I had to go with something that’s not conventional art): I’m “sad” just like you, because I’m horrible at cooking but I love fancy, delicious food. However, I’m not going to ask some chef to cook me a meal for free–a meal whose recipe they did not necessarily come up with themselves, or a meal that they might not have necessarily prepared all by themselves. Yes, I can’t cook the way that chef can, and I don’t even like cooking, but it’s common sense that, if I want somebody else who’s good at cooking to make me that meal, then I have to go to a restaurant and pay money to receive that service. Right?Whether it’s more clear now or not, I still wanted to say more about it from my personal perspective, so there’s more under the cut. But please don’t think I’m being rude! I’m afraid I probably sound so, so I apologize for that, but I really don’t mean to be rude, I’m just frustrated, so I hope you’ll accept my further (emotional) explanation! x) Keep reading

anonymous asked:Can you please post a listing of your fav fanfiction. I am looking for some new stuff to read and I would love your recommendations.I haven’t really read enough fanfiction to be able to make a normal list, but I can tell you my favorites? :) I mostly read Dramione, and my favorites are The Nietzsche Classes by Beringae (45k), Isolation and Hunted by bex-chan (~200k), and Cruel and Beautiful World by Lena Phoria (over 400k, but unfortunately it’s been taken down. I still have it saved though). And in terms of Drarry, nothing has been as good as Turn by Sara’s Girl, but again, I don’t really read x) Sorry!! I’m not the right person to ask for fic recommendations :)

“desi - a person of Indian, Pakistani, or Bangladeshi birth or descent who lives abroad” ;)

anonymous asked:As a fellow artist, I tend to have difficulty with consistency in faces (i'll draw a person, and i'll like the drawing, but find it difficult to repeat their features). You clearly don't (obviously, as you have drawn the majority of your characters more than once each), any tips? not in an insulting way at all: I love your artwork!!!I really don’t know what tips to give besides the most obvious one–figure out how your characters looks like (which takes a lot of practicing and trying different things out) and try to establish the features: how do their eyes look like? Nose? Lips? Eyebrows? Cheekbones? Chin? Hair? etc etc etc. And just draw draw draw.
For me, having a fancast can be sometimes useful. I designed my most-recurring characters over time by myself, without any help of fancasts or whatever, but it still could be helpful to take a model/actor that has a similar bone structure to your character (bone structure is enough–don’t worry about things like hair, eye color, etc–that you can change more easily) and then use that person as a reference to help you develop your character and maintain the same general structure and proportions as you practice drawing your character from different sides and angles (depending on different references of the model you’ve chosen). And eventually you’ll have memorized how their face looks like and will not need references anymore :)
Does that make any sense? I have no idea :D Sorry I cannot be more of a help!!
