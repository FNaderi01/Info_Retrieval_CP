Los Angeles Mayor, Eric Garcetti has taken the initiative to provide the current statistics surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. As of Tuesday, April 14. Mayor Garcetti disclosed statistical evidence of L.A. efforts to flatten the curve; it is showing promise with daily coronavirus increase in single digits. The Los Angeles City Mayor addressed pressing matters such as relaxing the Stay at Home order. Mayor Eric and his office has studied data locally and internationally, the evidence reflects that L.A. should remain under quarantine. The L.A. elected official explained the decisions to remain under strict physical distancing guidelines as we maneuver through many waves of the coronavirus increase.
Mayor Eric Garcetti began his announcement with the data surrounding coronavirus in Los Angeles. As of April 13. there were 25 additional deaths, 11 of these individuals were between the ages of 65 and over, with underlining health conditions. This brings the total COVID-19 related deaths in the L.A. County to 320.
Although “Drive-thru” testing locations increased the accessibility for the L.A. County, Mayor Garcetti recognized that a good number of Angelenos do not own a vehicle. In order to overcome that hurdle, there are new “walk-in” facilities. The first of its kind opened a couple weeks ago at Carbon Health in Echo Park. The second one opened Tuesday April 14. Anyone with symptoms can be tested at this time. Locations were strategically placed to prioritize African American communities and others within urban areas, since evidence has proven the COVID-19 related death rate are higher within the African American ethnicity. Mayor Garcetti stated, “This is very important because it’s the second move we’ve taken to serve African Americans and lower-income Angelenos, when we saw troubling statistics that this was disproportionately hitting black communities and low-income Angelenos,”

The Elected City Official foresees 2-3 more spikes in positive COVID-19 cases, one of the projected peaks landing on April 19. With that in mind the L.A. City Mayor is standing behind the currently enforced physical distancing guideline amid the flux of the virus. The study of past pandemics, proven that L.A. should remain in a state of observation of how other countries are being affected by relaxing their quarantine orders. So far, while examining Wuhan and South Korea the way the physical distancing regional guidelines are uplifted, makes a significant impact in the relapse of contracting the virus. Strategies in place for L.A.  remain steadfast in flattening the curve, while not falling blind to the need of help.
The Angeleno Card is being offered to families directly hit by the menace COVID-19 has caused in L.A. The Angeleno Card is “a free prepaid debit card intended for residents in Los Angeles with incomes below the federal poverty line,” it provides financial assistance for households in need of assistance. The three main requirements include: “You and Your household has fallen into deeper economic hardship during the COVID-19 crisis because at least one household member has lost a job or experienced a reduction in income of at least 50%. Or your household is within the City of Los Angeles, and Your household income fell below the federal poverty level prior to the COVID-19 crisis,”
L.A. COVID-19 cases have reached over 10,000 reports and Eric Garcetti has not taken this lightly. With the rise of Price Gouging, raising the cost of products essential to medical care such as gloves, hand sanitizer, and toiletries, the city has been cracking down on those trying to set an unreasonable price post-pandemic. So far, there has been 10 prosecutions against non-essential businesses that refuse to comply with the Stay at Home order. The city has been monitoring stay at home tests and remedies that has not been approved by the FDA. Eric Garcetti has been working every department and nonprofit outlet to contribute to the need of the assistance to this pandemic.
