  Summary
    Peter called Tony 'dad' in front of the Rogues, and so they assume he's Tony's biological son. The two of them keep pretending to be related to mess with them.This series follows their adventures as fake (but not really fake) father and son.

    Summary
      When the Rogue Avengers move back in, there's some complications. They meet Peter on awkward terms and immediately assumed that it's Tony's biological son. And as much as the two want to pretend their relationship isn't father-sonlike, they both know they're wrong.
