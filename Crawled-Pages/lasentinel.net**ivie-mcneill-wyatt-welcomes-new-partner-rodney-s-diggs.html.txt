Ivie, McNeill &amp; Wyatt Welcomes New Partner Rodney S. Diggs            
				By Sentinel News Service                
	                	                Published November 30, 2016
		Rodney S. Diggs
Ivie, McNeill &amp; Wyatt recently announced Rodney S. Diggs as its newest Partner. Diggs is the first Associate Attorney elevated to Partner at IMW since 2002. Diggs, who joined IMW in January of 2011, has been vital in developing the firm’s Employment and Civil Rights practice areas.
He is an experienced litigator with substantial trial experience in federal and state courts. He recently settled a civil rights/wrongful death lawsuit for $5,500,000.00. Diggs’ work on the case of Reginald Mitchell v. California Department of Public Health resulted in a published California Court of Appeal decision.
Mr. Diggs serves as the Chair of the IMW Labor and Employment Law practice group which focuses on wrongful termination, harassment, discrimination, retaliation, and wage and hour cases. He advises, strategizes and negotiates for his clients on a wide range of employment related issues. He is experienced in developing employment policies, responding to pre-litigation claims, and resolving disputes.

“Rodney Diggs is a very special attorney. He is brilliant, caring, and tireless. His track record of success is amazing. We are lucky to have him”, said Rickey Ivie, the firm’s managing partner.

Prior to starting his career at Ivie, McNeill &amp; Wyatt, Diggs clerked for the Honorable Patti Jo McKay, presiding judge for the Appellate Division for the Los Angeles Superior Court. He has been selected by Super Lawyers as a Southern California Rising Star for achieving and demonstrating excellence as an attorney in 2014, 2015 and 2016.
In 2015, Diggs was selected as one of 25 attorneys to the American Board of Trial Advocates SideBar, a part of the Los Angeles Chapter of ABOTA. He is a member of the Board of Directors and an officer for the John M. Langston Bar Association. He is also an active member of the Los Angeles County Bar Association.
“I am truly honored to be named a partner at such a prestigious law firm with its rich background and talented group of attorneys and staff.” said Diggs. “I stand on the shoulders of giants. I will continue to carry the torch and hold true to the rich tradition and legacy of Ivie, McNeill &amp; Wyatt.”
Diggs received his undergraduate degree in Sociology from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2005. At UCLA, Mr. Diggs was a member of the Track &amp; Field team where he achieved All-Pac 10 and All-American status in the 400 meters and 4×400 meter relay. Mr. Diggs received his Juris Doctor from Howard University School of Law in 2010 and was admitted to the California Bar that same year.
