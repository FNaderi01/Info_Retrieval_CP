                            kalendraashtar:Fanfiction - Magnificent StrangersThere are places where you half-expect to meet the man of your
dreams: a dim nightclub, while you dance around each other in a sweaty
courtship; a Christmas party, showered with copious amounts of expensive booze;
a holiday at an adults-only resort in Barbados, crawling with other
slightly desperate single people; a trendy pub after work hours, eyes clashing
from different corners of the room.And then there are places where you’d never expect to meet anyone
significant, much less the love of your life. The crowded and solemn wake of a relative, who happens to be a
prominent figure in the community. A dentist appointment bound to leave you
with two less wisdom teeth and a swollen face for three days. A midnight impromptu
trip to a convenience store to grab sanitary towels, because your period
arrived unexpectedly, when you didn’t even bother to put on actual clothes
underneath your trench coat.  Or a chemotherapy session, in the middle of your third treatment
cycle.Coming soonFirst chapter coming soon after Christmas. 🎀
