Congresswoman Waters Congratulates Metro upon Receipt of $10.5 Million Federal Grant for New Buses in the South Bay

Congresswoman Maxine Waters (CA-43), Ranking Member of the Financial Services Committee, congratulated Metro for receiving a $10.5 million federal grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) for the purchase of new buses, which will be used for transit service in the South Bay area of Los Angeles County.  Congresswoman Waters sent a letter to Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx, dated May 20, 2016, expressing her strong support for this grant.
“I am proud to have helped Metro obtain federal support for this important project,” said Congresswoman Waters.  “This project will enable Metro to upgrade its bus fleet and continue to provide essential transportation services in the South Bay region, while helping to clean up the air in our communities.”
Metro will use the grant to replace approximately 30 diesel buses in the Metro owned bus fleet, which have reached the end of their useful life.  The new buses will use compressed natural gas (CNG), a cleaner fuel.  The buses will be used to provide essential transportation services on up to seven transit lines in the South Bay with approximately 40,000 daily boarding and alightings.

“Los Angeles Metro is very appreciative of Congresswoman Maxine Waters’ support for this U.S. Department of Transportation Bus and Bus Facilities Grant,” said LA Metro CEO Phillip A. Washington. “These federal funds will help replace some of the last contracted bus service diesel buses in the Metro owned fleet with cleaner, low-emission CNG buses and fueling stations.  Additionally, Metro is proud of the innovative workforce development component involved in this grant that will train workers for future transit technology.”
“Residents and transit customers across the South Bay will benefit from the removal of these diesel buses and their replacement with cleaner CNG buses,” said Congresswoman Waters.
