    Summary
      Zack Fair is fine. Everything is fine. But sometimes he thinks about things he'd rather forget. And sometimes his flashbacks are so vivid, he might as well be strapped right back to Hojo's table. Double Entry for Whumptober 2020 No. 1 Let's Hang Out Sometime and Sephtober Week 1: Death - Defeat.
