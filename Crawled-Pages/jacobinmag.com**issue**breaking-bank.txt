        Breaking Bank
           Cover Art by Cat Sims
          I have, which will surprise you not a little, been speculating — partly in American funds, but more especially in English stocks, which are springing up like mushrooms this year (in furtherance of every imaginable and unimaginable joint stock enterprise), are forced up to quite an unreasonable level and then, for the most part, collapse. In this way, I have made over £400 and, now that the complexity of the political situation affords greater scope, I shall begin all over again. It’s a type of operation that makes demands on one’s time, and it’s worth while running some risk in order to relieve the enemy of his money.
          — Karl Marx writing to Lion Philips, 1864

          MIKE BEGGS

Prime Minister Tony Blair is seen here hanging out with Amstrad chairman Alan Sugar, Virgin boss Richard Branson, and EasyJet head Stelios Haji-lannou.-->
