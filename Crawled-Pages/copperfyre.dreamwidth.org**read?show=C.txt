The White Dragon - Chapter ElevenOct. 10th, 2020 12:15 pm
kalinara posting in i_read_whatSo last time, Jaxom was creepy and a jerk, while F'lar and Lessa were great, and not nearly as irrational as the narrative and the other characters seem to think they are.( How can Jaxom annoy me today? )

Rosemary Sutcliff's influence on Megan Whalen TurnerOct. 10th, 2020 05:32 am
duskpeterson posting in sutcliff_spaceMegan Whalen Turner, author of the Queen's Thief series (young adult historical fantasy), has been babbling like crazy in interviews about how much she loves Rosemary Sutcliff, so I thought I'd link to a few of the interviews where she mentions how Sutcliff influenced her work.
(A warning that Ms. Turner's series is incredibly spoilerific. The current blurbs all spoiler the first novel in the series, including the blurb to the first novel. However, here's a non-spoiler blurb for the first novel, which won the Newbery Award. The sections on Rosemary Sutcliff in these interviews don't give much away; use your Find button to skip down to them.)
Sutcliff's influence in general on MWT.
Sutcliff's influence on MWT's novel Thick as Thieves.
Sutcliff's influence on MWT's latest novel, Return of the Thief.

Tag Set Visible Now!Oct. 9th, 2020 10:49 pm
evil_plotbunny posting in yuletide_adminThe 2020 tag set is visible here!Many contributions created this tag set! Your tagmods have worked hard on it. We hope you enjoy it.In case it doesn't load, we have a basic app/list here. It may not show updates and corrections made after this post.CorrectionsDO NOT tell us:-if your fandom is in the wrong media category (a book under movies, etc), unless that is the only category that it is in. Please check ALL the categories before you report a problem.-if your fandom is in Uncategorized Fandoms. This is a work in progress, please be patient.-if the characters in your fandom all belong, but the disambiguation tags entered in brackets after their names aren't all the same. Sometimes we have to enter really long strings after a character name to keep the character where they're supposed to be.If the words in brackets entered after your fandom name are wrong (mis-spelled, misleading), we may look into that, but we'll probably look at other things first. Feel free to tell us, but this may not be corrected.DO tell us: -if you nominated something, but you can't find it at all.-if you nominated characters in a particular fandom, but you can't find them there.-if the characters you nominated got corrected to something wrong.-if your new fandom has been categorized in the wrong media category (and it isn't in any other category).Please provide your nominations link.Current QueriesWe have one question about the tag set at the moment (though there may be more as corrections are raised). Matthew Swift nominator, we're sorry, but one of your characters got lost in approval. Could you please provide your nominations page link and tell us what character to add back in?App and LettersThere will be a tagset app just as there was last year - thank you, karanguni! It will be available in a few days after some corrections have been made to the tag set.You will be able to add your letters later. Please stand by for a letters post, which is also coming soon, after the tag set has been tweaked.Some StatsFandoms with nominations from 10+ accounts:Enola Holmes (2020) - 18Hades (Video Game 2018) - 15The Locked Tomb Trilogy - 15 (was tied for first place last year with 19 noms)Nirvana in Fire - 14 (was in fourth place last year with 15 noms)成化十四年 | The Sleuth of the Ming Dynasty (TV) - 12Machineries of Empire Series	 - 11The Boys (TV 2019) - 10Twisted-Wonderland (Video Game) - 10Total initial fandoms:     3616 (255 more than last year)Initial characters: 13860Schedule, Rules, &amp; Collection | Contact Mods | Tag Set | Community DW | Community LJ | Discord | Pinch hitsPlease either sign in to comment, or sign your anonymous comments.

Nominations Queries Post ThreeOct. 7th, 2020 12:13 pm
morbane posting in yuletide_adminWe are 134 hours into tag approving and have 34 fandom nominations to sort out of our original 5302.With your answers to these questions, please help us untangle our last points of confusion so we can move on to tidying up the tag set and checking it for errors before making it available to you all!NB: Please include a link to your nominations page if answering a question about, or clarifying what you would like us to do with, your nominations.ATMOSPHERE ASMR Videos - this includes the nomination of a Viewpoint Character, which we find a bit ambiguous, as it sometimes seems to refer to the video watcher and sometimes a figure in the same room. Nominator, could you help us clarify this?Bad at Love - Halsey (Music Video) - this has the character nomination Women by Drinks Case. Nominator, please pick a woman.Champions League - Northendgirls - this has characters Arsenal F.C., Chelsea F.C., Gianluigi Buffon, and Juventus F.C., and we can't seem to find Gianluigi in this series. Help please?Cherry - Harry Styles (Song) - as far as we can tell, the lyrics do not seem to contain an ex-girlfriend? We would appreciate further information!Cordelia (Movie Poster 2020) - Yes, we are approving this with the man and woman who appear on the poster as characters. However. We also got this with character nominations "Audience's Crushed Hopes and Dreams (Cordelia movie poster)" and "Swirly Historical Wallpaper (Cordelia movie poster)". Does the nominator of those characters want these characters, somehow, in a separate anthropomorphic nomination? Keep in mind that anyone offering has to offer both the wallpaper and the crushed hopes and dreams.^note, this is amusing us and we thank you, but we really would appreciate the nominator coming forward to discuss this one as it doesn't fit into the more straightforward movie poster nomination.Dietland - with characters Alicia "Plum" Kettle, Kitty Montgomery, Leeta Albridge, and Rowena King. Nominator, could you clarify if you want the book or the TV show?Dogpound Shuffle (1975) - are Spot and Dog different characters? We'd appreciate more information.Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu | Legend of the Galactic Heroes - which has characters Reinhard von Lohengramm, Siegfried Kircheis, Walter von Schenkopp, and Yang Wenli. Which version would you like, please, nominator? We put this through as the 1988 anime last year - would you like that this time?The Haunting of Bly Manor (TV 2020) - we have not yet been able to confirm all the characters in this about-to-be-released show; if nominators have up-to-date information about the characters' names, please pass it along.Holy Water - Janet Devlin (Song) - this is nominated with the character Demon. Nominator, would you like Demons, for the demons to be washed away, or Devil, for the devil removed from the narrator's back? (This might not need character nominations?)Kissing in the Rain (Web Series) - this has James Porter and Lily Everett, and also Annabel and Edgar, who seem to be on a different level of fictionality to James and Lily. Nominator, could you please clarify what you were going for here (or correct us if we have misunderstood)?Lemon Demon (Musician) - this has characters Lemon Demon | Neil Cicierega, No Eyed Girl, The Cabinet Man, and Touchtone Telephone Caller, which seem to be a mix of characters from unconnected songs, and the singer himself. If there is a universe shared by the songs, nominator, could you help us find information about it, or otherwise clarify what you were hoping for from this nomination? My Brother My Brother and Me (Podcast) - this has characters Clint McElroy, Griffin McElroy, Justin McElroy, Mango Boy, SpankyGazpachoDW, Todd, and Travis McElroy. These characters do not seem to all exist at the same narrative level, with some hosts and guests and at least one hypothetical anthropomorphic character based off a sexiest food discussion. Nominators, could you help us out a little with what you wanted here?Marvel 1602 - this has characters Stephen Strange, Kurt Wagner, Jean Grey, and Wanda Maximoff. We cannot seem to find Kurt Wagner; nominator, can you help us find him? For the last two characters, will John Grey | Jean Grey and Sister Wanda work?Mongolian History RPF - this covers a vast swathe of history. The characters are Alakhai Bekhi, Altani, Fatima (d. 1246), Genghis Khan, Hö'elün, Jamukha, Khutulun, Mandukhai Sechen Qatun, Sochigel, and Töregene Qatun; nominators, we need you to help us either narrow down this category or split it.The Museum of Jurassic Technology - this nomination has us a little confused, containing Athanasius Kircher, Geoffrey Sonnabend, Madalena Delani and Valentine Worth. Nominator, is this RPF or something else - could you help us figure out what you want here?Peter Pan Goes Wrong (Play) - We can't find the BBC Technician character. Nominator, could you help us figure this one out?The Prisoner (1967) - nominator, for the character of Two, did you mean any particular version?全职高手 - 蝴蝶蓝 | Quánzhí Gāoshǒu - Húdié Lán - this includes a nomination for Lún Huí | Team Samsara, which seems to be a group. Nominator, could you please either clarify or pick a specific character?Rainbow Brite - with characters Color Kids (Rainbow Brite), and Rainbow Brite | Wisp. Is this the 1984 or the 2014 version, please? Nominator, could you please pick specific characters for the "Color Kids"?Star Wars Legends: Thrawn Trilogy - Timothy Zahn - this includes the character Quelev Tepper, whom we're having difficulty finding in this trilogy. Nominator, could you confirm this character appears, please?Thief (Video Games) - with characters Benny the Guard, Garrett, Interpreter Caduca, and Raoul; is this the original set of games or the reboot?The Umbrella Academy (Comics) - we can't find the character Claire Hargreeves in the comics. Nominator, could you help us find her or pick another character, please?Vantablack pigment feud RPF - this is nominated with Jake Parker, but we can't clearly see how he is connected to the feud. Nominator, could you help us out, please?Winter Wonderland - Andrews Sisters (Song) - is there a version of the lyrics we can't find, or is the Minister the same as Parson Brown?"&amp; Related Fandoms" / "All Media Types" fandomsWe need clarification from the person (or people) who nominated the following fandoms. Please specify a single version of the canon and provide a link to your nominations page so we can confirm the nomination. If these aren't answered, the fandoms will be rejected:Evita - All Media Types, characters: Che, Eva Perón, Juan PerónKemono no Souja &amp; Related Fandoms, characters: Erin (Kemono no Souja), Ial (Kemono no Souja)XCOM (Video Games) &amp; Related Fandoms, characters: Annette Durand, John "Central" Bradford, Lily Shen, Shaojie Zhang (note XCOM 2 and XCOM: Chimera Squad are also nominated)More info neededWe have some outstanding queries on the Evidence Post for Scumbag System (Donghua) and Seattle Kraken (NHL Franchise). Corrections: If your characters have been approved with mis-spellings or similar errors, go ahead and let us know, or let us know if your nomination was rejected and you're not sure why. Please do not tell us now about inconsistent disambiguation tags (the info in brackets after a character name) - disambiguations do not have to be perfect as long as they are not misleading.Schedule, Rules, and Collection | Tag set | Contact Mods | Participant DW | Participant LJ | Pinch Hits | DiscordPlease sign anonymous comments.

A Study in Scarlet: Read Through- American SojournOct. 6th, 2020 07:17 pm
luthienberen posting in victorian221bI haven't too many notes on these chapters, but the main points that stuck with me are:Chapter 4&amp;5John Ferrier goes to Salt Lake City where he entrusts an acquaintance to pass his letter to Jefferson Hope. He feels lighter because of this and returns home.As stated previously by mightymads this feels terribly out of character for a man who built a successful farm, was a wise hunter and guide. He clearly comprehends the danger his daughter is in for (a) he sends the letter to Hope and (b) when he returns home he encounters Strangerson and Drebber.I admit, considering his situation his loss of temper at them feels unwise.Indeed, his fears of being spirited away questions even more strenuously why he waited for Hope and did not snatch Lucy and ride hell to leather to the US Military who were stationed 50 miles away and would protect them from the Mormons as sanguinity said here.By the time Hope arrives the situation is desperate with their house watched. This causes me to seriously think that if Ferrier had only kept his temper and played along earlier he could have slipped off with Lucy with little trouble.Their escape is grim and certainly tragic, but knowing they had realistic options to successfully flee their captors just tarnishes what occurs.I think this entire tale would have been better served as a standalone story with Doyle able to devote proper research (and a happier ending!). As it stands, the lack of research undermines this background which gives us a sympathetic reason for Hope's murders.Lucy is the true victim here and an unnecessary one, as is her father's death.

Nominations Queries Post TwoOct. 5th, 2020 03:53 pm
morbane posting in yuletide_adminWe are 89.5 hours into tag approving and have 605 fandom nominations to sort out of our original 5302.Thanks for your answers so far! We have some questions from last post, and also a lot of new questions.NB: Please include a link to your nominations page if answering a question about, or clarifying what you would like us to do with, your nominations.The Adventures of Lady No-Kids (A Comic) - this has characters Lady No Kids (Lady No Kids), Levi's Parents (Shingeki no Kyojin), Stroller Kids (Lady No Kids), and The Goose (Lady No Kids). Autocorrect was not your friend! We assume the SnK character is meant to be the parents in the comic - is the Stroller Kids label meant to include both the child and the baby..?どうぶつの森 | Animal Crossing Series - nominated with characters Justin | C.J., Rex | Flick, Tanukichi | Tom Nook, and Tsunekichi | Redd. Nominator, is this a nomination for New Horizons, or something else? There is also a separate nomination for New Horizons, so we could fold the NH characters into that and approve the other two characters here under a separate game?Baba Yaga Fairy Tale - Baba Yaga the Witch, Baba Yaga the Witch's Cat, Baba Yaga the Witch's House, and Vasilisa the Brave - nominator, did you have a specific set of tales in mind?그 악녀를 조심하세요! | Beware of the Villainess! - is there a preferred version of Melissa's last name? We can find Podebrat, Poddebright, and Foddebrat.Blackadder - we'd appreciate some help from the nominators to untangle this fandom, as there are both nominations for season-specific characters and for characters who recur but in very different guises in different seasons, as follows: Anthony Cecil Hogmanay Melchett, Baldrick (Blackadder), Edmund Blackadder, Edmund Blackadder (Blackadder the Third), George Colthurst St. Barleigh, Kevin Darling, Prince George (Blackadder). Nominators, especially of Baldrick and Blackadder, what were you hoping for?Canadian Actor RPF - this has characters Callum Keith Rennie, Hugh Dillon, and Paul Gross. Nominator, is there a more specific fandom label you can suggest? "[Country] Actor RPF" is too broad.Cordelia (Movie Poster 2020) - Yes, we are approving this with the man and woman who appear on the poster as characters. However. We also got this with character nominations "Audience's Crushed Hopes and Dreams (Cordelia movie poster)" and "Swirly Historical Wallpaper (Cordelia movie poster)". Does the nominator of those characters want these characters, somehow, in a separate anthropomorphic nomination? Keep in mind that anyone offering has to offer both the wallpaper and the crushed hopes and dreams.Daniel Blackland Series - Greg van Eekhout - we can't find the Patriarch. Is this the Hierarch, nominator, or could someone please give us more information?Dietland - with characters Alicia "Plum" Kettle, Kitty Montgomery, Leeta Albridge, and Rowena King. Nominator, could you clarify if you want the book or the TV show?Dogpound Shuffle (1975) - are Spot and Dog different characters? We'd appreciate more information.The Electric State - Simon Stålenhag - we're having some trouble finding the character "The Intercranial Intelligence". Could we get some assistance with this please?Firefall Series - Peter Watts - for the character Theseus (Firefall Series), could you clarify please if this is a character separate from the AI referred to as The Captain?folklore - Taylor Swift (Album) - this fandom seems to have been nominated with a combination of song names, and character names from the songs - Friend from "Seven", James, Betty x2 (as song? As character? Both, from different people?) Inez, Narrator (August), and August. Nominators, what would you like from this nomination? We also have two other related nominations - Teenage Love Triangle Trilogy - Taylor Swift, with August Narrator, Inez, Betty, and James (folklore nominators, does that meet the needs of any of you?) and illicit affairs - Taylor Swift (Song).Ghost in the Shell (Anime &amp; Manga) - with character Aoi (Ghost in the Shell). Could the nominator please clarify if they meant any particular Ghost in the Shell anime or manga, for example, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex?Ghost of Tsushima (Video Game) - could you tell us a bit more about how the horses are active characters, please?Hadestown - with characters Eurydice (Hadestown), Hades (Hadestown), Orpheus (Hadestown), and Persephone (Hadestown). Nominator, could you please clarify if this is OK to fold into another nomination that is specifically for the musical? Or did you want the concept album?Haunted Elevator - SNL Sketch - this includes characters B-Boy Skeleton and Dancing Skeleton, but as far as we can tell, they both dance and are both referred to as B-Boys…? Would 'Day Skeleton' and 'Moynihan Skeleton' be acceptable?Heart of Gold - Sharon Shinn - this has characters Brolt Barzhan, Chay Zanlan, Jalciana Candachi, Kerk Socast, Kitrini Candachi, Melina Luris, Nolan Adelpho, Pakt (Heart of Gold), but we're having trouble finding Brolt Barzhan and Jalciana Candachi in this book. Nominator, could you help us out with more information, please?Henry V - Shakespeare, with characters with characters Fluellen, Gower, Henry V of England, and Pistol, and Henry IV - Shakespeare Edward "Ned" Poins, Henry "Hotspur" Percy, Shallow, and Sir John Falstaff. As well as these nominations, we have a nomination for Shakespeare's Second Tetralogy, with characters Bolingbroke | Henry IV, Prince Hal | Henry V, and Richard II. Nominators of Henry V and Henry IV, do you have any opinions about combining these fandoms into the Second Tetralogy? Tetralogy nominator, if other nominators would prefer them separate, how would you prefer to handle your characters?Ιστορία του Πελοποννησιακού Πολέμου - Θουκυδίδης | History of the Peloponnesian Wars - Thucydides - this includes Aristophanes as a character, but we're having trouble finding him. Help please?Jennifer's Body (2009) - this includes the character nomination "Low Shoulder", but the band members are named and the lead singer gets several lines. Nominator, could you please pick one of this group?Katmai National Park Bear Cams - Explore.org, with charabears 128 | Grazer (Katmai), 151 | Walker (Katmai), 480 | Otis (Katmai), 503 (Katmai), 610 (Katmai), 747 (Katmai), 812 (Katmai), 821 | Pepper (Katmai), and Fat Bear Week 2020 with 128 AKA 'Grazer', 32 AKA 'Chuck', 435 AKA 'Holly', 480 AKA 'Otis'. May we merge these bears under the first label, to create a single, larger, fat bear fandom?Kate Daniels - Ilona Andrews - this has characters Barabas Gilliam, Christopher Steed, Curran Lennart, Derek Gaunt, Elara Harper, Erra (Kate Daniels), Hugh d'Ambray, Julie Olsen, Kate Daniels, and from the spread of characters, we're not quite sure which titles are covered. Nominators, could you clarify please?The Left Hand of Darkness - Ursula K. Le Guin - we have nominations for "First Investigator 1" and "First Investigator 2". Are these Ong Tot Oppong and Otie Nim, or a reference to Winter's King? Nominator, please clarify.Marvel 1602 - this has characters Stephen Strange, Kurt Wagner, Jean Grey, and Wanda Maximoff. We cannot seem to find Kurt Wagner; nominator, can you help us find him? For the last two characters, will John Grey | Jean Grey and Sister Wanda work?Oishinbo - with characters Kaibara Yuzan, Kurita Yuko, and Yamaoka Shiro. Nominator, did you want the manga, anime, video game, or live-action film?Peter Pan Goes Wrong (Play) - We can't find the BBC Technician character. Nominator, could you help us figure this one out?The Prisoner (1967) - nominator, for the character of Two, did you mean any particular version?Rainbow Brite - with characters Color Kids (Rainbow Brite), and Rainbow Brite | Wisp. Is this the 1984 or the 2014 version, please?The Sims (Video Games), with characters Bella Goth, Cassandra Goth, Grim Reaper (The Sims), and Original Characters. We are not willing to approve original characters or to approve The Sims as a whole while also approving subfandoms. Please either pick a specific game, with the Goth &amp; Reaper characters, or pick a specific game, with no characters, for worldbuilding. (Note there is also a separate nomination for The Sims 2.)Sims Bustin' Out/Urbz handheld/Sims 2 DS (Video Games), with Cannonball Coleman, Dusty Hogg, Giuseppi Mezzoalto, Luthor Bigbucks. Not all the characters seem to appear in Bustin' Out, and although they appear in the other two, their backgrounds are different in each - nominator, could you pick one title (The Urbz: Sims in the City (for Gameboy Advance) or The Sims 2 (for Nintendo DS)) or give us more information, please? Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) - this includes a nomination for Dwarfs. Nominator, please pick a dwarf.Snowpiercer (2013) - the characters nominated, Andre Layton, Bess Till, Melanie Cavill, and Miss Audrey (Snowpiercer), seem to be from the TV show. Nominator, please clarify what you wanted?Spelunky - this includes the character of Spelunker. Is this meant to refer to the default "Spelunky Guy", or to any of the possible spelunkers with unlockable content?Star Trek - Various Authors - with characters Evan Wilson, Jinx to-Ennien, Leonard "Bones" McCoy, Spock (Star Trek). We'd like to hear from the nominator, please - did you mean Uhura's Song? This is otherwise too broad.ウルトラシリーズ | Ultra Series - this has characters Kei Fukuide, Ultraman Belial, Ultraman Z, and Ultraman Zero. Nominator, could you confirm which series you meant? Are these from Ultraman Geed and Ultraman Z, or something(s) else?Vatican Miracle ExaminerWe have nominations for three different versions of this canon. Could the nominators please consider the following groups and discuss whether you'd prefer a combination of anime &amp; light novels OR to have the anime and the light novels in the tag set separately? If you nominated AMT, please especially link your nominations page. (Thanks everyone for disambiguating neatly, btw.) バチカン奇跡調査官 | Vatican Kiseki Chousakan | Vatican Miracle Examiner - All Media Types - characters Hiraga Josef Kou, Hiraga Ryouta, Josef Lycolas Bartridge, and Roberto Nicholasバチカン奇跡調査官 | Vatican Kiseki Chousakan | Vatican Miracle Examiner (Anime) - characters Bill Suskins, Hiraga Josef Kou, Hiraga Ryouta, Hiraga's father, Hiraga's Mother, Josef Lycolas Bartridge, Julia Michael Borge, Lauren Di Luca, and Roberto Nicholasバチカン奇跡調査官 | Vatican Kiseki Chousakan | Vatican Miracle Examiner - Fujiki Rin - characters Ajmer Chandra Singh, Hiraga Josef Kou, Roberto Nicholas, and Ruggieri RutherfordWonho (Musician) - Unfortunately, Wonho is too popular a character to be approved under our RPF rules. Nominator, do you still want the other character, Kang Riye, by himself?"&amp; Related Fandoms" / "All Media Types" fandomsWe need clarification from the person (or people) who nominated the following fandoms.

camalyng posting in fictional_fansDown here in Aotearoa New Zealand, we're seeing more cosplayers trying their hand at putting on community events outside of the profit-driven multicity con. The one in my city on November 1st, Great Games With Pals, is running a fanart raffle to help fundraise for the venue - eight winners will win a commission from one of the artists who have donated and are tabling at the event.Tickets are $2NZD (a weaker currency than the USD, Euro, GBP, AUD, and various other currencies) and the raffle closes on the 25th (the 24th if you're behind the date line).For those wondering about events during covid, Aotearoa's community cases are in the single digits and on the other side of the island from this event, with no community transmission for nine days.Disclosure: The GGWP coordinator is my friend; I'm the Yuna cosplayer on the poster and website.

Fannish pub-quiz style quizOct. 4th, 2020 11:28 am
china_shop posting in fictional_fansIf anyone wants a ready-made fannish quiz for a social gathering, here's one I made for our local fan con this year. It's tailored to our attendees wrt fandoms referenced, but most of the sources are fairly widely known, especially for anyone who's been in fandom/slash fandom for any length of time. There are seven rounds:Round 1: AO3 StatsRound 2: Hey, it’s that actor! Round 3: Have you read this? Round 4: Theme tunesRound 5: Tag, you’re it!Round 6: Episode titlesRound 7: Masquerade( Brief description of each round. )Teams usually pick a bonus round and get double points for that. Jsyk, there aren't equal numbers of questions for each round. And some of the stats referenced are changing on a daily basis, so you'd have to specify the numbers are as at 1 Oct 2020. It takes roughly two hours.The quiz pack consists of a PPT (including question slides and answer slides), two handout PDFs for rounds 3 and 6, an answer booklet for the presenter (only needed if you'd going to mark the rounds yourself; the answers are also in the PPT), and a quiz score sheet. I am not a professional quizmaker and do not guarantee the quality of this quiz, but people seemed to have a good time?Google docs folder containing the quiz packIf you don't want to run it as a quiz but want to check it out and see how you do on your own, feel free. And if you do play, I'd love to hear how it went, how hard people found it, and any feedback on the different rounds.

The White Dragon - Chapter TenOct. 3rd, 2020 10:20 am
kalinara posting in i_read_whatSo last time, on White Dragon, F'lar proved to me again why I love him (...and who'd have thought, after Dragonflight, that THAT would be possible) and Robinton proved to be a total fucking douchebag.  Again.  Still.Oh and because somehow this didn't get in my last recap, at one point Robinton calls Menolly a "saucy girl".  Excuse me while I vomit.( And he still sucks at running a school )

Nominations Queries Post OneOct. 4th, 2020 12:26 am
morbane posting in yuletide_adminWe are 50 hours into tag approving and have 2277 fandom nominations to sort out of our original 5302.We have some questions about your nominations - please help us answer them so we can approve or correct tags.Among Us (Video Game) - this includes a nomination for the Mini Imposter, but we're having trouble finding this character. Could we get more information, please?De brief voor de koning | The Letter for the King Series - Tonke Dragt - we can't find the characters Viridian and Ristridin for the books, but we can find them for the show. Was this nomination meant to be for the show, or could we get more information about this please?Cordelia (Movie Poster 2020) - Yes, we are approving this with the man and woman who appear on the poster as characters. However. We also got this with character nominations "Audience's Crushed Hopes and Dreams (Cordelia movie poster)" and "Swirly Historical Wallpaper (Cordelia movie poster)". Does the nominator of those characters want these characters, somehow, in a separate anthropomorphic nomination? Keep in mind that anyone offering has to offer both the wallpaper and the crushed hopes and dreams.The Culture - Iain M. Banks - there is a nomination for Original Culture Minds. Yuletide doesn't use original character nominations; nominator, could you clarify what you wanted?Deeplight - Frances Hardinge - nominators, are The Lady and The Hidden Lady the same, or different, characters?Dragon Prince Trilogy - Melanie Rawn - with characters Jahnev of Remagev, Jihan (Melanie Rawn), Pol (Melanie Rawn), and Sionell of Remagev. Is this a nomination for the Dragon Star trilogy or for a combination of the two trilogies?Emma (2020) - there is a nomination for Jane Foster, whom we can't find in this canon. Is Jane Fairfax meant, or someone else?Ga1ahad and Scientific Witchery - Mili (Song) - the characters nominated are Ga1ahad and Witch. For Witch, do you mean the narrator, or one of the "witches who can't be loved"? (Are character nominations needed for this song?)Ghost in the Shell (Anime &amp; Manga) - with character Aoi (Ghost in the Shell). Could the nominator please clarify if they meant any particular Ghost in the Shell anime or manga, for example, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex?Havana - Camila Cabello (Music Video) - this includes the singer nominated as a character, but she seems to play several distinct roles. Nominator, did you mean Karla? Or another role?Hellraiser (Movies) - this includes the character nomination "Cenobites". Nominator, could you pick one please?幻影ヲ駆ケル太陽 il sole penetra le illusioni | Day Break Illusion - this includes the character "Leguzario" - could the nominator please give us more information? This seems to be the name of an organization.Jennifer's Body (2009) - this includes the character nomination "Low Shoulder", but the band members are named and the lead singer gets several lines. Nominator, could you please pick one of this group?Little Red Riding Hood (Fairy Tale) - nominated with the girl, the wolf, the grandma, and the woodcutter. Nominator, which version did you want, please? There are several popular versions.Monster Prom (Visual Novel) - this includes the character nomination "Damien LaVey's Dads". Nominator, could you please pick either Lucien or Stan?The Prisoner (1967) - nominator, for the character of Two, did you mean any particular version?Rainbow Brite - with characters Color Kids (Rainbow Brite), and Rainbow Brite | Wisp. Is this the 1984 or the 2014 version, please?What We Do in the Shadows (TV) - this includes the character nomination "Mosquito Collectors of the Tri-State Area". Nominator, could you please pick one of this group?"&amp; Related Fandoms" / "All Media Types" fandomsWe need clarification from the person (or people) who nominated the following fandoms.
