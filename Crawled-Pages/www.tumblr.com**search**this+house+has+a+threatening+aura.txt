            The Dragon’s Lair        - A Special Edition Chapter -This is the thirty day bonding period report of Kim Namjoon. I am writing this because Kim Heechul is a tyrant who threatened to make everything I eat taste like broccoli for an entire month if I missed even a single day. For my owner’s privacy, since I don’t know who all is going to see this, I won’t use her real name. Her aura has always reminded me of one of my favorite jewels in my collection, a star blue sapphire, so for this report her name will be recorded as Star.  Keep reading

            Day 1 ~ Something old // Something new // Something borrowed        A.K.A.: That AU where Adam accidently acquires Niall’s leather jacket in a charity shop. (T-Rated)Written for @pynchweek, flash-betaed by @interropunct. Paging: @cabeswaterlovesthem, @picapicae and @actuallymollyweasley as they asked to be kept updated (I’ll tag whoever asks me, feel free!)You can also read this on Ao3!                                                         ***The cheerful dangling of the bells above the doorframe matches in a weirdly euphonious way with a string of swear words, more convoluted than Adam has ever heard in his life. He lets the door close behind him and mentally prepares to assess the situation critically. Two young men stand in front of the cashier counter, and even though Adam knows Blue is on shift today they are both so tall he can’t possibly spot her over their shoulders. Adam wouldn’t particularly worry about the shortest one — all curly blond hair, fidgety shoulders and a placid aura palpable even without seeing his face — but the one beside him is a different story: dressed completely in black, the guy is built like a brick house, hair buzz-cut and tattooed skin that flexes with nervous tension. Not reacting with prejudice and distrust when faced with stereotypically threatening features has been the work of years, for Adam, but in this moment he can’t really pin the rising scowl on his face to his idiosyncrasies. Not with a wanna-be biker — if not an actual one — swearing like a sailor towards his best friend.“Sir, please understand that this is a charity shop, and that I’m not emotionally involved in the situation,” the deeply unimpressed voice of said best friend pipes up. “Quite frankly,  I don’t give a damn.”“Wh…what the fuck?” the wanna-be biker stutters, evidently taken aback by Blue’s unique approach to customer service. Or maybe by the Gone with the Wind reference, it’s difficult to tell.The blond guy snorts out a laugh and the tension is suddenly broken.When the wanna-be biker turns to face the other man, his profile is unexpectedly young and full of sharp edges smoothened by some degree of embarrassment. “Don’t laugh, shithead, are you pairing up with the enemy?” “Sure, ‘cause I’m the enemy now,” Blue’s epic eyeroll is almost hearable from her words. “Look, I’ve been really trying to help you, I even gave you back most of the stuff back.”“And you really can do nothing about the fucking leather jacket?” Wanna-be biker asks, tuning down the swearing for a second.“I told you, it has been sold already,” Blue sighs deeply.Adam looks down at himself and at the new-old jacket that Blue had convinced him to buy just yesterday. It’s a sturdy item of well-worn black leather, remarkably preserved for something you can find in a charity shop; it must have cost half a fortune, back in the day, because even now falls elegant — if not a bit too large — around Adam’s shoulders. Suddenly, he is stuck with the possibility that it is still worth a small fortune, in the vintage market, and maybe that’s the reason the wanna-be biker wants it back after having made an ill-advised donation.“Ronan, I’m sorry, if I hadn’t mixed up the boxes…” the blond guy pipes up, apologetical and distraught in a way that halts Adam’s train of thought in its tracks. The wanna-be biker — Ronan — sighs and shakes his head, “It’s fucking fine, Matthew, I should have left you better labels.” For all his general rudeness, there is a carefulness in his tone that captivates Adam’s attention more than any random eavesdropped conversation should.He abandons his spot by the door, where all the commotion had made him invisible, and takes a couple of steps forward. “Are we talking about this jacket?”Both Ronan and Matthew turn on their heel, in complete synch, and whatever moment Ronan had been having gets swallowed by an unapproachable frown. He squares Adam up and down, plush mouth thinning while taking in the jacket. “Yes, exactly that one.” Keep reading

Ghost paint notes is as close as they’re gonna get to letters in this AU. “You need to stop working yourself so hard, Doc,” Jack says. His eyes are hard, but concern is covered within the blue depths. “If you didn’t exhaust yourself, you wouldn’t be so jumpy.”“I’m perfectly capable of taking care of myself, Jack.” Her words don’t mean to come out so harshly, but it doesn’t phase him. It only wrinkles his brow even more. Sighing deeply, Angela sips her tea. Nearly hunched over it, she cups the warm mug in her hands. The warmth fills her palms and steadies her fingers.
