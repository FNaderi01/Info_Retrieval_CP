    Summary
      After years of intense training, Mikaela Shindo is the first omega to finally be recognized and accepted into a beta-dominated law enforcement. To his surprise, he was placed within the newly established and Alpha Apprehension Bureau (AAB) where his omega abilities would excel exponentially. And that they did, for Mika was successful in capturing some of the most wanted alpha criminals with his irresistible charm for the past twelve months.Too bad all of the experience he'd gained on the job wasn't enough to prepare him for the situation he's gotten himself into with a certain idiotic alpha apprehended for a recent string of violent murders.

    Summary
      Yuu is a Beta, well, at least he wishes he were. No one knows he is an Omega, aside from his parents Shinya and Guren. Yuu might be an Omega, but he'll sure as hell kick your ass. After all, he's not labeled the strongest beta for no reason. Sure he feels guilty keeping his dynamic from his friends, especially Mika, but Yuu's certain they would understand. He's kept his secret safe for 15 years, and he'll be damned before anyone discovers it. How long can he keep his secret safe?*** Oh darb, looks like this is gonna be on hiatus for a bit, I'll be back soon(ish) though!***

    Summary
      This was a stupid idea. Mikaela should have never done this. Why did he do this again? Oh, right, because Lacus and René had persuaded him to. So there he was, Mikaela Shindo, heartthrob of many girls at Sanguinem High School, pressing his lips against his best friend’s.

    Summary
      "With every passing second, Yuuichirou became slightly more irritated. He found himself (quite aggressively) washing the dishes behind the counter of the café Shinya Hiiragi had established after the vampire-human war. He and many of his friends started working here, including Mika, for the concept of the café was to bring humans and vampires together in order to build a good relationship in the post-war times. Right now, he was watching as his former squad leader was talking to his best friend in a soft voice, leaning towards him to whisper something, and grinning her stupid typical Shinoa Hiiragi grin while Mika turned bright red. Yuuichiriou scrubbed a little harder. It wasn’t like he was jealous or something stupid like that. Not of Mika, and definitely not of Shinoa. No way. He was just very irritated because this had been going on for longer than a week now, both Shinoa and Mika keeping secrets from him and leaving him out of everything."
In which oblivious Yuuichirou doesn't realize it's the 16th of October and thinks everyone is keeping secrets from him.

    No Archive Warnings ApplyHyakuya Mikaela/Hyakuya YuuichirouIchinose Guren Saotome Yoichi Kimizuki Shihou Hiiragi Shinoa Sanguu MitsubaOblivious!Yuu Implied Past Child Abuse Alternative Universe - High School Fluff and Angst Yuu learns how to friend Guren can be a mother hen sometimes Mika is charming and tragic at the same time somehow Kimizuki can be a relationship genius and I will always be stuck in mikayuu hell Pining Mika is my favorite Mika Shinoa can be a little too much but I still like her Yoichi is an innocent cinnamon roll some suggestive sexual content towards the end
    Summary
      Yuu doesn’t realize he likes him likes him (in that same way Yoichi liked Mitsuba that one summer) until the light catches blonde locks at a certain angle, catches blue eyes and makes them shine in a way that has Yuu’s heart thudding in his chest. It’s only then that Yuu realizes he has an embarrassing crush on student body president Mikaela Hyakuya.
Kimizuki is never going to let him live this down. 
(or the high school au no one asked for)

    Summary
      Asuramaru is 100% done with Yuu's denial over his sexuality and his feelings for Mika(now that  he knows Mika is alive) and decides to take things in to his own hands...
