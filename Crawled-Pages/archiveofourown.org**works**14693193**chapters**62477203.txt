      Chapter 33: Chapter Thirty-Three
    Chapter Text
    Author’s Note: If you’re reading this because you got an email about my update, STOP. There are new scenes in chapters 31 and 32, and this won’t make sense without them! If you’re bored and adore this fic, Chapter 1, the Homunculi timeline in Chapter 22, and Elicia’s characterization throughout have also changed! Fortunately, they don’t heavily impact this chapter, so feel free to skip them.   “Lieutenant Colonel Elric?”Ed glanced up to see an unfamiliar soldier standing in the doorway. If any of Mustang’s unit recognized him, they didn’t say so. The man had long black hair tied back in a ponytail and two loose strands framing his face. He smiled genially. Ed didn’t smile back.“Yeah?”“Would mind coming with me? The Führer is requesting your presence.”Ed frowned. “Requesting?”“It can be an order, if you’d like. Whatever makes you more comfortable.”Ed huffed and closed his book. He left it on the floor with a stack of others as he stood. “How long’s this supposed to take?”“I’m afraid I wouldn’t know. I’m only the messenger.”Ed snorted. He didn’t believe that for a second. “Alright. Let’s get this over with.”The man’s smile grew a centimeter wider. Rather than moving out of the way, he held out a hand for Ed to shake. “Lee. Pleasure to make your acquaintance.”Ed roughly accepted the greeting. “Ed.”“Ed. How wonderfully informal.” Lee reopened the door and swept out an arm for Ed to go first. Ed glanced back to see Havoc nod, then left. Once the door shut behind them, Lee said, “This may seem unprofessional, but I actually requested to be the one to fetch you.”Edward grunted. “That so?”“Indeed.” Lee kept a casual pace as he led Ed through the halls. If he was concerned about getting to Brad in a timely manner, he didn’t show it. “You could say I’m a fan of your work. You could also say I was curious about the man who so brazenly challenged the Führer.”Ed hummed, disinterested.Lee continued. “My coworkers think you’ll lose this battle, but I wonder. With a will as strong as yours and that indomitable need to protect innocents, you may win out yet.”“And what do you do, exactly?”“Research experimental alchemy. Nothing as glory-worthy as saving the city, I’m afraid, but it puts dinner on the table.”“I’d rather have knowledge than glory any day.” Ed caught Lee’s interested glance and responded with a shrug. “Have you published anything?”“Not officially. I often read your brother’s papers though. He’s brilliant.”“Yeah, he is.” As they neared Brad’s office, Ed tapped his palm against his thigh. The array allowing him to read Core alchemy centered in Brad’s office, but its reach extended past the walls, into the hallway. Ed turned to say he had it from there only to falter. His escort’s aura was a bright, sunny yellow.Lee was the one who painted the array at Greeling’s house.Rather than waving Lee off, as planned, Ed tilted his head. “What did you say your full name was again?”“I didn’t.” Lee’s smile twitched with amusement. They stopped outside Brad’s office. “I do hope we meet again, Ed.”“We will.” Ed took a small step into Lee’s personal space. “I’ll make sure of it.”“Until then.” Lee nodded and walked away. Ed watched as Lee reached the end of the array’s circle of influence and the yellow around his silhouette faded away. Only after Lee turned the corner did Ed knock on Brad’s door.One more player identified. One more cog ready to be ripped from the machine. Brad was still ahead of them, but not by much. Ed rolled his shoulders. They could do this.“Come in.”

Stiff posture and a frown. Those were the only signs that Elric was surprised to see so many Homunculi together in one room. Selim watched golden eyes sweep over each one of them and noted the way Elric kept his back to the door. The boy had stepped into a den of lions, and he knew it.What he clearly didn’t know was why this was happening. Selim clasped his hands behind his back as he waited to see who would make the first move. For as much as this meeting had been called for Aunt Trisha, Selim needed it, too. To betray or not to betray. Was the Fullmetal Alchemist worth the risk? Hopefully, this meeting would tell.Elric used a blasé tone to ask, “Am I interrupting something?”Selim’s father smiled. “My apologies. We need to retake your Core measurement, and my son was quite adamant about thanking you for saving him during your promotional ceremony. Two birds, one stone.”Elric frowned, not even trying to hide his disbelief. “And the rest of them?”“We lead very busy lives, and our schedules rarely align. I didn’t think you’d mind.”“I don’t.” Elric glanced around again. “Where’s Greeling?”“He couldn’t make it.” Selim’s father’s smile turned placating. “Please, have a seat.”“I’d rather stand.” Elric watched Selim’s father for an extra beat, and Selim could see the urge to fight slide into his posture. “What hurts more?”Strong black brows crinkled ever so slightly. Genuine confusion. “I’ll need more context.”“Context is Greeling. Does it hurt more that chose me or that he chose me over you?”Selim straightened at the calm jab. Aunt Solaris hid a smile behind her hand. Even Aunt Trisha lifted her head to see how her brother would react.The Führer only smiled wider. “Gerard has always enjoyed asserting his independence, and he always returns home when he’s finished.”Elric whistled lowly, undeterred. “That’s what makes you the better man, I guess. I mean, if my little brother left me for a different head of household because I wasn’t good enough…?” His lips downturned condescendingly. “I’d be humiliated.”The entire room stilled. If looks could kill, Elric would be dead. The insult had been delivered with a cold calculation. Behind that: Anger. Beautiful, malicious anger that knew to strike while the iron was hot. For the first time, Selim looked at Elric not as a boy biting off more than he could chew but as a man choosing his battles. A wolf circling prey. Selim’s interest spiked, and the impulse to side with Uncle Gerard spiked with it.Selim’s father was no longer smiling. “Part of being a child is going astray. It’s the duty of head of household to patiently await their return. If you remain head of household long enough, you’ll see that.”Elric blinked, unimpressed by the badly-veiled threat, then his eyes dilated. Blonde eyebrows rose while chapped lips parted in silent realization. Selim waited for an explanation, but it never came. Elric’s gaze moved to the desk, his interest in the Führer all but gone. “We reading my Core or what?”“Are you in a rush, Lieutenant?”“Wouldn’t want to keep you from your family is all.” Elric stepped further into the room, willingly surrounding himself on all sides, and motioned to the fist-sized Core reader on the desk. “That it?”“It is.”Selim saw Aunt Trisha shift behind Elric, likely so she could see his face as he was measured. The reader was rigged, of course, but Aunt Trisha had requested this meeting specifically to observe Elric. Considering how much smarter she was than the rest of them, Selim could only hope she would choose to share her findings later.Elric placed his palm on the stone, which turned a light red. The counter connected to the stone rose to fifty-one and stopped. Elric lifted his hand, unsurprised. “Can I go now?”Selim hurried over to Elric before his father could respond. “Mister Elric?” Selim filled his tone with wonder while peering shyly up through his lashes. “I-I wanted to say thank you. For saving me. I was…” He made his voice waver and blinked away false tears. “I was really scared.”Selim expected a warm smile and gentle reassurances. What he got was a stare bored and knowing enough to belong to Uncle Gerard. Elric crouched so he was eye-level with Selim, put a hand on Selim’s shoulder, and leaned in to whisper, “Look, we don’t know each other, and I don’t necessarily want to kill you, so here’s a pro-tip. Keep acting like you’re ten, and I’ll break your fucking teeth in.”For a split second, shock overrode Selim’s anger. Elric knew about him. His heart thumped heavily in his chest as he tried to figure out what that meant. Knowledge was an advantage, so why reveal himself? And why only to Selim? Did he think Selim was allied with Uncle Gerard? If so, why risk Selim’s wrath with a threat? What was the purpose of Elric’s actions? Selim kept his body language neutral, unsure whether to affirm or deny Elric’s beliefs.Elric took the decision out of his hands by standing and shooing Selim away. “If there’s nothing else…?” Elric looked first to Aunt Solaris, then to Uncle Gordon, then to Aunt Trisha, before finally settling on Selim’s father.“You’re dismissed.”Elric gave a lazy, two-finger salute and turned to leave. Aunt Trisha caught him by the arm as he went. They stared at each other, seeming to have an entire conversation without a single word. She lifted her head. He sneered. She raised her eyebrows. He pursed his lips. She laid her head back down. His expression relaxed into something closer to understanding, maybe even fondness. She let go. He left.Selim was the first to ask, “What was that about?”Aunt Trisha lifted her shoulders in what barely qualified as a shrug. “Gerard.” Her gaze lazily found its way to Selim. “I would ask what he whispered to you, but I can already guess.” She smiled, half-humorous, half-mocking. Selim’s anger burned anew.“My guess is it was a warning against us. Perhaps our misdeeds?” Aunt Solaris tossed Selim a coy smile. “Am I close?”Selim pretended not to notice the way Aunt Solaris overlooked Aunt Trisha’s interaction with Elric, but fury and indignation boiled his blood. She believed Aunt Trisha too smart to fall prey to her games. Her opinion of Selim was much lower.He smiled. “You’re exactly correct, Aunt Solaris. He said not to trust you or Father. He also assured me that he’s always there if I need him.” He maintained eye contact, daring Aunt Solaris to contradict him.She tilted her head as her smile twitched wider. “How quaint.” It was impossible to tell if she believed him or not, but she was amused enough to leave it be either way.“Was that sufficient, Trisha?” The Führer used a low, pleased voice to draw everyone’s attention. Aunt Trisha hummed noncommittally. His father continued, “What say you? Are you with us?”  “I don’t know if I’m that committed, but I’ll listen.” She frowned like even that small concession was a wearying amount of work. “If I do end up agreeing, I’d like my payment – the money to keep my lifestyle intact – in advance. You know…” She eyed Selim’s father through thick lashes. “In case you lose.”Selim expected his father to respond angrily, but the man only smiled. “Deal.”Like a breath of fresh chloroform, Selim’s urge to betray his father calmed. For unlike the majority of his father’s expressions, that smile was genuine. Humorous, even. It spoke leagues for his thoughts on the likelihood of loss, and, at least in this case, the arrogance was warranted. Elric’s continued bull-in-a-Drachma-shop approach was proof enough of that. Vast resources. Unprecedented knowledge. And still, he was playing directly into the Führer’s hand.While Selim’s father couldn’t hone fury to save his life, when it came to utilizing resources and outmaneuvering opponents, he was king.

Ed knew he should go back to Mustang’s unit. Mustang was no doubt waiting to hear about the meeting, and Ed actually had information worth sharing.But that book…Ed knew the moment he saw it. Philosophy of the Soul by Adeana Narkov, written in its original Aerugonian. At least six-hundred years old. Rare. Rarer than rare. Ed actively sought books by Narkov, and he’d never even heard of that one.Narkov was known for experimental alchemy so dark that Ed had never seen one of her books outside a restricted section or black market. They were taboo and generally correct, making them doubly valuable. Books like Narkov’s didn’t disappear on their own. The fact that they were practically extinct meant Brad had put in the time and effort to make it so. Unfortunately, that also meant Ed could only think of one place the book might be.Armstrong Manor.The Armstrongs were an incredibly old, incredibly rich family. Their library was bound to be impressive and, more importantly, untouched by the Führer. If there was a six-hundred-year-old banned book to be found, it was there. And Ed needed to know what it said.“Fullmetal?”Ed pushed his bangs out of his face, and the sweat from running all the way to Armstrong Manor kept them back. “Armstrong. Hey.” He breathed deeply, enjoying the burn in his lungs. “Can I come in?”Armstrong moved to the side to let him through. She was dressed in casual, work-out clothes, and the sheen of sweat on her skin matched Ed’s own. “You’re early.”“I’m…” Ed scrunched his brows. “Oh, shit. Dinner. Yeah. That’s not why I’m here.” He glanced around the large, marble entryway. “Where’s your library?”“Second floor, third door on the right. What are you looking for?”Ed was halfway up the staircase by the time he shouted, “Philosophy of the Soul by Narkov.” He ran to the library without waiting for an answer.The library was as gorgeous as he’d thought it would be. Rows and rows of books towering above him. Staircases leading up into the third and possibly fourth floors. The urge to peruse until his arms were filled was strong, but he was there for a reason. He climbed another set of stairs to find nonfiction alchemy authors whose surnames began with ‘N.’“Find what you’re looking for?”Ed glanced over his shoulder to see Armstrong had followed him. He grinned. “Yeah.” The book was old, maybe even older than the Führer’s copy. Ed held it like a treasure as he carried it over to one of the many lounging areas. “I didn’t know this existed until I saw it in Brad’s office.” Armstrong raised a single, elegant eyebrow. Ed shrugged. “I read a fuck-ton of books.”“And you think this book will help you?”“I think if we’re going to beat Brad at his own game, this book is a good start.”Armstrong watched him closely before nodding. “Very well. Are there any other books you would find helpful?”“Nothing specific, but if you’ve got anything on the philosopher’s stone or Shadow Cores, I’d love to see them.”“I’ll go check.” She left without another word.Ed carefully cracked open the cover. The air momentarily filled with the magical scent of old, rarely opened books. The title page was hand-written in beautiful Aerugonian while the paper itself was yellowed and fragile. Awe bloomed in his heart as he realized it wasn’t a copy. He was holding a book written by Narkov herself. He ran a gloved finger carefully over the title, absolutely in love with the work and dedication that went into creating it, then got to work.He was a hundred and twenty pages in before he found the arrays.
  Years ago, in a dark cavern in Kavel, I stumbled upon rumors of a stone capable of performing inequivalent exchange. The natives cursed it as witchcraft, but I was irreparably intrigued. Alchemy without equivalent exchange? Surely it was impossible, and yet…
  I had to have it. I had to know. Was there such a thing as this sorcerer’s stone? If so, how did it work? What price need be paid, if not an equivalent one? I devoted my life to finding the answer, and after much experimentation, I found it. The stone exists.
  Before going into detail on the stone’s creation, I must separate rumor from fact. Yes, the stone does exist. Yes, it can perform incredible feats without visible payment or an active array. Yes, it can do the impossible. It is not, however, capable of inequivalent exchange. 
  Allow me to explain. Unlike other alchemy, which is based on turning one physical substance into another, the stone functions on an exchange of worth. As long as what you give to create the stone is equal, in your eyes, to what you will receive, it will work. 
  Take my husband for example. I sacrificed him to create the stone, then used the stone to bring him back. He materialized in front of me, alive and well. One life in exchange for the exact same life. Equivalent exchange. The stone, with its powers drained, turned to dust. 
  The second time I sacrificed my husband, I used the stone to repair our home to its former glory. The stone remained intact but was unable to bring my husband back. I used the remainder of the stone to heal my son’s injuries – he had fallen off the roof in an attempt to fix the chimney weeks back – then it turned to dust.
  Finally, I sacrificed my son. The idea was to bring my husband back, but the stone did not work. I pondered over this for days and days. My son was stronger, younger, and healthier. By all means, I should be able to trade his life for my husband’s with stone to spare. That was when I realized the exchange was not physical. It was mental. 
  I could not trade my son for my husband because, in my eyes, they were not equal. My son was a kind but stupid boy who helped with the housework. My husband, the love of my life. To get my husband back, I would have to give up something equal in worth. Unfortunately, the only thing which could equal the love I have for my husband is my knowledge, and I am unwilling to part with it. 
  For those of you who still wish to pursue the stone, regardless of its drawbacks and limitations, know that very few arrays are wholly incorrect. There are many theories and many variations on the array required to create the stone, but only one element truly matters.
  Sacrifice.
  You must sacrifice a soul whose value is equal to that which you wish to gain. The most reliable arrays, of course, are drawn in blood, but for a lesser stone, charcoal will do. Now, I’m sure some of you are thinking ‘This is impossible. The thing I want is priceless.’ Fear not, young scholars. The stone is capable of delivering on even the wildest of wishes. You must only offer something priceless in return.
  Before you fret over what, exactly, counts as priceless, know that there are array options for even the ficklest of alchemists. The array below, for example, judges intent upon being drawn. When offerings are made within the circle, they are compiled, one on top of the other, until the threshold for worth is reached.
Ed glanced at the array, which mirrored the one painted over Ishval, and turned the page.
  If that doesn’t work – if no number of stray sacrifices can amount to the worth of your desire – I recommend the array below. Rather than accepting every sacrifice and summating their worth, this array lies dormant. When it senses something of equal worth within its borders, it will activate, taking what it is due and rewarding you with the stone. 
  The caveat here is that the array is unable to tell which soul activated it. Everyone within the circle during its activation will be counted as part of the sacrifice. Depending on how much you care for innocent bystanders, this can also be considered a perk. The accidental sacrifices will still be tallied based on worth as you see it and thus increase the power of the stone. And if you do happen to sacrifice someone you care about, simply keep your avarice in check and bring them back. 
  Or don’t. Loved ones, after all, are worth quite a lot.
Ed stared at the array drawn on the page – the array drawn over Central – with unseeing eyes. He’d known Narkov was sick, but not like this. Not to the point of sacrificing her family for a little extra information. His stomach churned just thinking about how her son and husband must have felt as she betrayed them. Murdered them. He tasted bile thinking about all the other arrays she must have tested and, with that, the lives she must have sacrificed.He glanced up to see Armstrong had brought him over three dozen books, only nine of which he’d already read. A few authors with dark tendencies similar to Narkov stood out, and the knowledge that this would hardly be the worst of his research momentarily deadened his eyes.He went back to reading.
  (***Intertwined***)
Roy expected Edward to report in directly after his impromptu meeting with the Führer, so of course that didn’t happen. Which was fine, overall. If Edward wasn’t reporting in, it was likely because he didn’t think there was anything worth reporting. In the meantime, Roy had plenty of other issues requiring his attention. He could wait.Or, he started out being able to wait. Then Edward ran off into the sunset with Olivier Armstrong and never returned, and Roy could think about little else.Distance had prevented him from considering her competition in the past, which was clearly a mistake. It wasn’t hard to predict how much Edward would enjoy her violent temper and brash personality. Roy was just an overconfident idiot who hadn’t taken it into account. Thanks to that, Edward was, for all intents and purposes, on a date with a beautiful woman who outranked, outclassed, and out-wealthed Roy.All that talk about defining their ever-ambiguous relationship, and not once had it occurred to Roy that he should clarify they weren’t supposed to date other people. He could have. He should have. By the Gate, Fullmetal was constantly telling him that they weren’t dating. Roy just never imagined that meant they were free to date others. Hell, he’d thought Fullmetal was being cute.As it turned out, Edward’s charming phobia of commitment hadn’t led to them falling into bed together but to the blonde taking Roy’s superior out in his place. And yes, Roy was jealous. He had probably never been more jealous in his life. He was practically burning with jealousy from the inside out, and he could do nothing about it because they weren’t dating. They were just kissing, cuddling, and bringing each other to the heights of pleasure while carving out a plausible path to genuine happiness.God, was this how Roy’s one-night-stands felt afterwards?Plenty of them had claimed a personal connection and asked for something more, but he only brushed them off with a pleasant smile and knee-weakening goodbye kiss. He didn’t care about them on a personal level. He didn’t think about them again after leaving. He certainly hadn’t considered how they must have felt as he wined and dined someone new right in front of them.If they felt anything close to Roy’s current cocktail of diffidence, resentment, and envy, then he really was just as much of an ass as Edward believed. Unfortunately, that little nugget of self-discovery was too little, too late. All Roy could do was wait.By the time the door opened, Roy had finished half his paperwork, written three speeches, and decorated the table with a now-cold four course meal. Roy tensed, felt the bitterness that would surely infest ‘How was your date?’ and decided not to say anything at all. He heard Fullmetal shuffling around in the entryway, no doubt removing his cloak and boots.Irritation and insecurity simmered under Roy’s skin. Would Edward even notice he was upset? Would he care? If Roy started the conversation by pointing out his desire for exclusivity, would Edward agree? If not, how should Roy respond? It wasn’t like breaking things off or offering ultimatums were really options. There were too many variables, too many unknowns, and Roy’s heart was too filled with ire.Metal clinked against tile as Edward walked into the kitchen. Roy continued to stare at his paperwork. A thick book thumped against the table. The chair scraped against the floor.“This food for me?”Roy’s response was snide. “Didn’t you eat with Armstrong?”“No. Lost track of time.”Roy lifted his head, and the snark died on his tongue. Edward looked exhausted. “What happened?”“A lot. The meeting with Brad was a sham. He said it was to remeasure my Core, but the whole fucking family was there. I was right about the dark green aura belonging to Lust, and the mossy green one is her brother’s. Gluttony.”“Gordon?”“Yeah. I saw the sunny yellow one again, too. It’s Lee. The guy who got me for the meeting. I don’t know who he actually is, but he’s bad news. On top of that, I’ve got no fucking clue why Brad actually called me there. The only upside is the book I saw on his bookcase.”Roy glanced at the book on the table in question.Edward shook his head. “No. It’s not a book I’d heard of before. I went straight to the Armstrong’s to see if they had it in their library.” He hesitated. Pushed his bangs back. Continued to stare at the table. “Sorry. I know you were waiting on me, but I had to find that book.”Guilt curled in Roy’s gut. “It’s fine. What did you find?”Blonde brows scrunched, and when Edward breathed out, one of his walls came down. Flesh and metal shoulders slumped tiredly. Golden eyes stared unseeingly at the table. Expressive lips pressed into a thin, defeated line. Roy’s heart stuttered as he realized he’d seen that particular expression before, after the Hughes were attacked.“The chimeras, they uh, I think they’re meant for the stone. Because it’s not really inequivalent exchange, and Brad wants something he considers priceless. But he’s not going to give up himself, and he’s not going to give up his title, so the next best thing is to give up something he considers better than what he currently has. Yeah?”“Sorry, Fullmetal. I don’t follow.”“Yeah, no, it’s fine. I’m not making a lot of sense. It’s a, uh…” He licked his lips. “It’s godhood, I think. Power. The creation of new life. I think Brad’s trying to create what he considers the perfect being, and when he succeeds, the array will activate. He doesn’t have the chimera array down, or he’d already have struck, but he’s close. You can see it in the chimeras that have already attacked. If I had to guess, I’d say the other thing he’s missing is the perfect specimen.” He rested his elbows on the table and cradled his head in his hands. “I think he’s going to use Greeling.”Roy stiffened as empathy and shame dug their claws into his lungs. “Why do you think that?”Edward pressed the heels of his palms into his eyes and took a deep breath. When he raised his head again, the walls were back up. “It doesn’t matter. I’ll go to his place tomorrow morning and help fortify it as best I can. There’s still a mountain of books at the Armstrongs’ for me to read, so I’ll be heading there after class. Don’t bother waiting up.”“Noted.” Roy paused to take in the determined, regretful set of Edward’s jaw. “What else?”Edward’s gaze was heavy. He examined Roy with an apologetic calculation that Roy was used to seeing in Maes, and Roy knew Edward was deciding whether or not to share more. Weighing the pros and cons, as it were, for trusting Roy. Eventually, Edward sighed.“We need to kill the Führer.”Roy nearly choked on his own spit. “No.”“I’m not asking, Mustang. I’m telling. This is kill or be killed, and right now, we’re practically lining ourselves up for his convenience.”“The only thing that’s changed since we last spoke is that we know more about his plans. That’s a step closer to victory, not defeat. If we expose his chimera operation, he’ll be stripped of his title and imprisoned. That’s the path we take.”Edward’s eyes hardened. His lips downturned in a displeased frown, but the vehement argument Roy expected was absent. Instead, he softly explained, “I see the way you guys look at me when I say this is war. You think I’m emotional. You think I’m headstrong. What you don’t stop to think about is what happens if I’m right. It doesn’t matter if you imprison Brad because he has the connections to escape and keep going. It doesn’t matter if he loses his position because all he has to do is activate the blood array, and all of Central will be wiped out. That array is linked directly to Brad’s desires. So long as he’s alive, it’s viable. Whether he’s the one that creates the chimera or not.”“All the more reason for us to bring him down before he finishes the array.” When Edward’s only reaction was an unimpressed stare, Roy lowered his voice to hiss, “We cannot assassinate the Führer. He’s the most powerful man in Amestris, and we’re his most visible enemies. I can’t provide an airtight alibi if I actually killed him, and my political career won’t recover from that kind of open-fire.” He paused, then lowered his voice further to whisper, “If – if – we can’t stop him before the array is finished, that’s when we start looking at other avenues. Until then…” He shook his head. “The answer is no.”Golden eyes closed, resigned but not defeated. “If I get a clear shot, I’m taking it.”“Edward—”“You don’t see it yet, but you will. I only hope it’s not too late when you do.”Edward opened his eyes. He wasn’t angry or accusing. Just resolute. It was then Roy realized he was speaking not to Edward Elric, but The Fullmetal Alchemist. This was a man who put his life on the line for the rights and liberties of strangers without having to be asked. He fought more battles than he walked away from, and he didn’t always win. It was pointless to point out the risks because he didn’t care. This wasn’t about Edward’s future or safety. It was about the people.Just like always.Suddenly, Roy felt childish. Edward hadn’t gone on a date with Armstrong. He’d utilized a resource. He worked himself to the bone, yet again without expecting thanks for praise, and come home to Roy being a passive-aggressive ass. Sometimes it was hard to tell which one of them was actually older.Roy swallowed thickly. “Please, Fullmetal. I know there’s a lot at stake here, but you have to trust me on this. Stand down until we can prove his guilt and arrest him. Give me time.”“And if he finishes the array first?”“Then we consider alternative routes.” Edward’s sneer said he didn’t agree, but he didn’t say anything to the contrary, either. Roy glanced at the clock to see it was nearly one in the morning and sighed. “You haven’t eaten yet, have you?” Edward’s stomach answered for him, and Roy waved a hand over the cold food. “Go ahead. It’s for you.”Edward hesitated, but his appetite won out. He murmured his thanks and piled food onto a plate. Roy expected some tense dinner-talk, like complaints about the catty way he’d greeted Edward or an in-depth look at Edward’s side of the kill-the-Führer argument, but it never came. Edward ate in silence.It was Roy who broke the tension by admitting, “I thought you were on a date.”Blonde brows scrunched. “With who? Armstrong?” Roy nodded. Edward tilted his head thoughtfully. After a moment, he made a face like he understood the appeal and nodded. “She does have a better library than you.”Roy rolled his eyes. Of course that was what Edward would focus on. “Fullmetal, are you… Do you want…” Roy licked his lips and took a deep breath. “I would like for our whatever-this-is to be exclusive. What about you?”“Nope.”The single word was deadpanned and delivered between bites of food. Devastation and irritation washed through Roy’s chest. “Why not?”“Don’t get your panties in a bunch. I’m not interested in anyone else. And if I were going to do whatever-this-is with not-you, I’d break it off with you first.” His fork clattered against the empty plate before he pushed his dinnerware away. “I just think you should keep your options open is all.”“Hold up. You want me to see other people?”“No. I just… Ask me again after Brad is dead.”Roy’s first instinct was to rehash the fact that they were not going to assassinate the most powerful man in Amestris. Then he saw Edward’s desire, comfort, and apology buried beneath the exhaustion. Edward liked that Roy wanted to be exclusive. He liked the attention, and he liked the commitment. He just wouldn’t let himself have it.Rather than agreeing or disagreeing, Roy said, “I’m not dating anyone else.”Golden eyes glowed with a mirthful warmth. “You’re an idiot.”“I’m your idiot.”“Is there a return policy?”“No.”Edward scoffed, but rather than taking his book and moving upstairs, he started reading at the table. While it was a small gesture of unity that did nothing to solve the large-scale issues brewing between them, Roy was still grateful. No matter how they decided to proceed on the Führer front, they would do it together. Edward’s flesh foot purposefully brushed Roy’s leg under the table. Roy’s Core flushed with contentment. He glanced up to see what Edward wanted, but golden eyes remained glued to the book. Roy hooked his toes around the back of Edward’s ankle. Edward smiled.The words I love you crowded behind Roy’s teeth. He swallowed them down.
