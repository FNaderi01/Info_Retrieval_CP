    Summary
      Ryuk gets bored a bit earlier, and drops the Death note 10 years earlier.
Light still picks it up, but as a child Light avoids the thrall, and never uses the death note.
That doesn't stop a death note also being dropped 10 years later and Kira becoming a thing.
When Kira happens Light,Sayu and Ryuk start their own investigation to stop Kira, involving BAMF Sayu, Ryuk whose here to mock everyone and Light with a ridiculous crush on the detiective sho is convicned he's Kira.
