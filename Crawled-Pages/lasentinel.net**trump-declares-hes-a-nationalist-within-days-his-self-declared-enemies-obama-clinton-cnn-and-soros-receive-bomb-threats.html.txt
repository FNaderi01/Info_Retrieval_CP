Trump Declares He’s a Nationalist, Within Days his Self-Declared Enemies Obama, Clinton, CNN and Soros Receive Bomb Threats            
				By Associated Press                
	                	                Published October 24, 2018
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on possible explosive devices sent to former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton (all times local):
2:40 p.m.
        ADVERTISEMENT        
President Donald Trump says “acts or threats of political violence have no place in the United States.” He’s addressing the suspicious packages sent to former President Barack Obama, the Clintons, CNN and others.
Trump says he received a briefing from federal officials earlier Wednesday on what he called the “despicable acts.” He says that “a major federal investigation” is now underway.
And he’s calling on the nation to come together, saying: in these times “we have to unify.”
Trump did not mention any of the recipients of the packages in his remarks.
But he says, “We’re extremely angry, upset, unhappy about what we witnessed this morning and we will get to the bottom of it.”
Trump’s comments came at the top of remarks discussing his administration’s efforts to combat the opioid crisis.
2:30 p.m.
New York City police say a suspicious package found at the New York City office of Gov. Andrew Cuomo did not contain a bomb.
Department spokesman J. Peter Donald said on Twitter that the item had been “cleared by NYPD personnel” and was unrelated to pipe bombs mailed to high-profile Democrats and CNN’s hub in the city.
A spokesman for Cuomo said the package contained computer files related to a far-right political group that has been in the news lately over a brawl with protesters.
Cuomo had initially said during a news conference Wednesday that he had received a “device” at his office.
Later, Cuomo told reporters outside his office that it had been a “hectic” morning. Earlier in the day, his office had denied receiving any suspicious packages.

2:20 p.m.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he condemns “today’s attempted acts of domestic terrorism” after explosives were sent to the homes of Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama.
McConnell thanked law enforcement and first responders “who protect our leaders and public figures from such unconscionable acts.”
The crude pipe bombs targeting Clinton, Obama and the TV network CNN were intercepted Tuesday night and Wednesday.
1:20 p.m.
NYPD’s chief of counterterrorism says the explosive device sent to CNN’s headquarters in New York appeared to be sent by the same person who mailed pipe bombs to George Soros, Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama.
John Miller and FBI officials said a news conference the devices all appeared to be crude pipe bombs. The New York device was black and had wires.
Miller says it started on Monday night with the device sent to Soros. He says they’re looking at the devices as a pattern, and they have not made any arrests.
No one was injured by any of the devices.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo said during the new conference he would not be surprised if more devices were uncovered. He said his office received one and it was being dealt with.

1:05 p.m.
New York City’s police commissioner says a package sent to CNN’s offices in New York contained what appeared to be a live explosive and an envelope containing white powder.
At a briefing near Manhattan’s Time Warner Center, Commissioner James O’Neill pledged to bring the perpetrators to justice.
The police department’s top counterterrorism official, John Miller, said the substance was being tested to see if it is dangerous.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at the briefing that “we will not allow these terrorist thugs to change the way we live our lives.”
Investigators said the device appeared to be similar to explosives sent to former President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and billionaire George Soros
1 p.m.
Hillary Clinton says at a Florida fundraiser that “we are fine” and is thanking the U.S. Secret Service for intercepting an explosive device in a package “long before it made its way to our home.”
Clinton was speaking at a Coral Gables fundraiser for Democratic congressional candidate Donna Shalala, a former health and human services secretary.
The former secretary of state says her family is grateful for the Secret Service’s “service and commitment and obviously never more than today.”
The Secret Service says the package addressed to the Clinton’s suburban New York home was identified as a potential explosive device during routine mail screening procedures. The Clintons didn’t receive the package and were not at risk of receiving it.

Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, the No. 3 Republican in the House, said “this is a dangerous path and it cannot become the new normal.” He said the attempted attacks are “pure terror.”
Scalise survived life-threatening injuries after he was shot at a congressional baseball practice in 2017. He tweeted that he’s experienced “first-hand the effects of political violence.”

11:43 a.m.
Two law enforcement officials say a suspicious package that prompted an evacuation of CNN’s offices in New York City is believed to contain a pipe bomb.
The officials said the CNN bomb was crude but operational and was addressed to former CIA Director John Brennan, who appears on air on other broadcast and cable outlets.
The officials say the device discovered Wednesday appeared to be similar to explosives sent to former President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and billionaire George Soros.
A separate law enforcement official told The Associated Press that the explosive discovered at Soros’ suburban New York compound on Monday was a pipe bomb.
All three officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the investigation publicly.
The Secret Service hasn’t provided details about the devices that were sent to Clinton and Obama.
