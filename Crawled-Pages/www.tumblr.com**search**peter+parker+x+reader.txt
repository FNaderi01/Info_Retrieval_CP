Teacher: Okay Peter, What historical or passed down item did you bring for us today? Peter: What I brought has been through WWII. They are very ancient, old. They change our history and I’m glad to bring them to represent today’s presentation. Be careful though, it is fragile and most likely to break.Steve &amp; Bucky sitting in a chair in the front of the class, staring at him confusingly:…Peter: They are also very delicate that you can’t put them near ice or anything cold. Bucky: you know what Parker—

            Make Me Hurt - Peter Parker        Originally posted by heydrichmullerWARNING: SMUT, THIGH-RIDING, OVERSTIMULATION, SMUT SMUT SMUT (SEX POLLEN)WORD COUNT: 3777a/n SO SORRY I AM TAKING FOREVER TO GET THINGS OUT. I HAVE HAD MAJOR WRITERS BLOCK. I actually began this story like 2 months ago before i got blocked. HOPE YOU LIKE IT—-You told him that it was a bad idea. Tony specifically told the two of you to stay away, but Peter wanted to see what everyone was being so secretive about. Of course you didn’t want to join him, but he begged you and Peter had this ability to convince you to do just about anything. He knows it too. So when he came into your room and begged you to come with him (Tony would be less likely to yell at him if you were with him), you couldn’t say no.But you should’ve.“Peter what are we even looking for?” you asked him with a bored expression. Peter looked back at you and shrugged. He didn’t have a clue. You sighed and leaned against the door frame, waiting for your idiotic friend to hurry up and leave. The deal was that you would go with him to the room, but you wouldn’t go in. Peter whined for a moment about it, but decided that it was better than nothing.“I’m guessing I’ll know it when I see it,” he commented as he continued snooping around Banner’s work space. Guessing that you would be there for a while, you pulled out your phone and began scrolling through social media. You could hear Peter shuffling around the room mumbling to himself, but you concluded that if he found what he was looking for he would let you know.It was quiet for a while, maybe two or three minutes before you heard clattering and Peter let out a short cry. When you looked up, you saw Peter flat on his ass looking up at some weird pink plant. You didn’t move to help him up or make any noise because of the look he had on his face. He looked dazed or distracted, like he was in some trance.“Pete?” you asked with furrowed brows, shoving your phone back into your pocket, “You doing okay over there, Spidey?” Keep reading

            after hours│t.h        Originally posted by tomhollandnetpairing: professor!tom holland x reader words: 6.9k (hehe nice)warnings: swearing, PURE FILTH, sir kink, rough sex, masturbation (male &amp; female), exhibition kink if you squint, spanking &amp; sort of public sex.summary:  It’s wrong, y/n tells herself. She can’t help it though. She can’t help fantasising about him. At the other end of the class, Tom tells himself to stop staring at her. It’s creepy, he thinks. Neither one knows of the mutual pining that is until tension bubbles over. a/n: I’m back bitches! I’m still a fucking sinner and this is such a cliche, I’m so so sorrymasterlist━━★✼☆｡y/n sat at the desk. Her eyes never left Mr. Holland. Her attention never left the way the veins in his arms bulged when he picked up the massive textbook, never left his perfectly gelled hair and how it sat atop his head like it was crafted to from the day he was born. Perhaps I should start typing the notes that were on the board, she scowled to herself.She feels dirty, almost ashamed of her crush on him. She hates herself for falling into a stupid cliché that had been so easy to avoid all these tireless years. y/n doesn’t know why she has gone back to a love-sick teenage girl fantasising about a boy who she’ll never even get to touch. A boy that so out of her league, he wouldn’t even had the faintest idea that she exists. That doesn’t stop them though. y/n still finger fucks herself to an orgasm that no boy has been able to give her in her 24 years of life, all the while wishing it was his cock instead of her fingers. If Mr. Holland knew what she did to herself under the influence of him and his stupidly handsome face, he would be disgusted. This she knows for a fact. This isn’t what she thought she would be doing, in all honesty. She is a semester away from graduating and she never wanted to be stuck in a perpetual state of wanting someone so unattainable it’s not uneasy, it’s borderline unethical. She truly believed she would have ancient married professor that sound like their legs deep in their coffin. Instead she got a literal Greek God as her Psych professor. She knows that she’s not the only one of course. y/n has met 10 other girls in her class that probably write god awful poetry about Mr. Holland’s liquid bronze eyes. She can’t blame them, if she could write shitty poetry about him, she 100% would. y/n not angry either, she knows out of the 120 students (110 of whom are girls), are probably all in the same predicament. She sometimes gets dirty looks from them when Mr. Holland address her by her first name. Perhaps that’s something she should consider; he calls her y/n not Miss y/l/n or just simply Miss. It’s different, it’s endearing and when he has a raspy voice, it’s so fucking hot.“y/n,” a voice called out, she shook herself out of her haze, “are you still with us?” Mr. Holland was no standing over her. His cologne surrounding her, intoxicating her. y/n gulped softly before turning her eyes to his. “Yes, sorry sir,” y/n replied quickly, trying her hardest not to stumble over her own words or even let the blush run to her cheeks. Mr. Holland smiled warmly, “that’s good, I need at least one of you listening,” the class erupting in laughter, “I would prefer it to be one of the brightest.” That though got them quiet. y/n sunk into her chair in embarrassment. The blush she had been fighting rose to the surface, making her even more adamant not to look up at him but alas she couldn’t.In that small fleeting moment, she caught something in his eyes. She couldn’t define exactly what it was. Whatever it truly was, y/n knew teachers should not be looking at their students in such a way. It made her even more lightheaded with admiration. The lesson continued on as normal for another hour. Mr. Holland described the outline for the next assignment, it seemed short and sweet. Write a 2-thousand-word essay on the effects of unintentional recreational drugs during early childhood. y/n had to laugh at the way Mr. Holland phrased it. It was as if he had never touch pot in his entire life, to be fair, y/n wouldn’t be too surprised if he didn’t. Most of the girls in his class groaned at the mere mention of actual work and not an hour and a half session of pure toe-curling orgasm material. Now that she thinks about it, that would be a wonderful way to spend her Wednesday mornings and Thursday afternoons. Of course, y/n was in another word during the last minutes of the lesson. Unable to focus on anything other than the hint of a tattoo peeking through the underlining of his shirt. She was working so hard to distinguish what it was that she had completely missed the end of the lesson and the dozens of people walking out. “y/n, what exactly are you doing?” Mr. Holland’s voice asked above her. y/n almost jumped in her seat, but she stayed completely still. “This is the second time today, should I be worried?”This though made her jump out of her seat. “No of course not sir!” She defended as she rushed to place her things away. “I was just off in wonderland today.” “Are you sure there is nothing distracting you?” He asked. Yes. “No,” she replied hurriedly.“You know you can tell me if something is,” he reassured her. Yes, of course. Let me just tell you about how you are distracting me by always wearing the hottest casual suits every lesson and giving me the wonderful fantasy of tearing it off you.“I know that, it’s just been my busy schedule,” y/n lied through her teeth. She’s a broke college student with hardly any friends or real other assignments. “I am just working really hard, you know?”Yeah, working really hard to imagine you pounding me into next week!With that last thought, y/n knew she needed to leave before she exploded with embarrassment and arousal right there in front of him. “I just wanted to let you know that you are totally allowed to change the topic of the assignment if you feel like there is something that strikes a chord with you,” Mr. Holland smiled brightly. Fuck! Did he have to look so gorgeous even when he’s trying to be dorky and supportive.Mr. Holland noticed the shocked look upon y/n’s face and immediately retracted his statement, “I promise I won’t fail you, if that’s what your thinking.” He explained. “I really enjoy your work, you’re a gifted woman with a real talent and I don’t want to see it go to waste with my shitty assignment.”y/n turned her attitude around. He was stumbling over his words. It was kind of cute and endearing, like everything he does. She smiled warmly at his compliment. “Sir,” she spoke softly. It came out a lot mouseyer and somehow sexual than she would have liked but she refused to back out of her statement. “I can’t wait.”She didn’t say another word but simply slung her back over her shoulder and made her way out of the class. Tom followed her figure in complete and utter shock. He praised whatever god watched over him for the small mercy that was having y/n’s back turned to him to witness his immediate blush cover his entire freckled face. Tom never let his eyes leave her. He just watched her waltz right out of his classroom, he bit his lip at the sight of her perfectly cupped ass in her jeans. Through-out the entire lesson, all he could think about is how her tits would bounce as his dick thrusted up into her little cunt. Just the thought made his cock spring to life. He stared up at the clock. He had to be in another lecture in 10 minutes, he had to teach another round of student without her pretty face in it in 10 bloody minutes. Sadly, it wasn’t enough time to imagine cumming over her said face. He fidgeted until his painful erection was safely hidden. God, you are such a fucking creep, Holland. He thought to himself.━━★✼☆｡y/n really didn’t want to be doing this. She really didn’t want to have to walk to the library in a mini skirt she had when she went through her cringy hoe phase and a low-cut tank top she only really wore to bed at 8 at night. Luckily before she left, her roommate gave her a full can of pepper spray and a pocketknife. A handle tool for when you looked like a prostitute. She had no choice. It was laundry night and she had to get her assignment out of the way, or she would never finish it in time. She wanted to kick herself for letting laundry night fall on the only night the library stayed open until midnight. It was a perk for sure but not when you had nothing to wear but pink neon rags. y/n pushed open the library door and relieved herself of the anxiety of being abducted by the greeting of Harry. He looked familiar but she couldn’t pinpoint where she had seen his face before. “What cha doing here?” he shouted. Quite contradictory for a librarian. y/n grinned when she saw his dorky face at the counter. That is until he caught wind of her outfit, or lack thereof. “Got a late shift at the strip-club after this?” Her face fell. “I hate you,” she played along, her arms slumping on the cold desk. y/n looked around the library. It was basically empty, with the exception of the middle-aged teacher grading a stack full of papers. Poor bastard, y/n thought. “Got one for me?”“You’re going to get me fired if I do this again,” Harry huffed, he banged his head against the keyboard in frustration. “This is the last time,” y/n explained, “I pinkie promise.” She lifted her hand over the counter and waved her pinkie finger in Harry’s face. He stared up her than move his eyeline to her finger now just touching the tip of his nose. He groaned loudly as he took her finger in his. “There is a ton of empty booths, choose one and don’t make a sound,” Harry told her angrily, y/n simply clapped her hands in celebration and skipped off. She chooses the booth in range of Harry, in hopes that maybe he will distracted her and she won’t have to do her work because she’s too busy goofing off. y/n dropped her stuff in a huff. Her back slumped into the curve of the chair and the desk covered her body happily. She placed her earphones in and played her favourite study music. She was in absolute heaven. The assignment was kicking her ass, but she was determined to do it. Mr. Holland seemed genuinely excited for what she would write about if she did decide to change the topic. Now though she’s regretting not letting Mr. Holland’s hopes down. She could find hardly anything online and even if she did it was by some random SJW on Tumblr. That’s what lead her here tonight. In hopes that maybe some privileged white asshole with a degree would have some sources sighted to help her. Unfortunately, she was having trouble with that too. It was now 11:30pm. She had been at this god forsaken table for two and a half hours now in an endless pursuit of bullshit. y/n had half a mind to give up and just suck his dick for the grade like other girls would in this situation. y/n had to remind herself though, she is a gifted woman with a real talent that should not be wasted on something shitty to please the masses. Did she just quote Mr. Holland? She caught eyes with Harry in her block, who had two pencils stuck up his nose in an attempt to cheer her up. It did for the most part. y/n wanted to play along but it had seemed someone else had walked through the door at that very moment and Harry threw the pencils out. Harry’s face lit up with red upon the arrival of this mystery person. y/n was interested in who this mystery person was. That is until she saw his face. Mr. Holland walked up to the library desk in a fit of laughter. His hands smacking the counter and his face contorted in a wide smile. y/n instantly ducked under the table. She could faintly hear their conversation. It just sounded like muffled words until her name popped up. Jesus Christ. Not now. Not tonight. Why of all night to run into his must it have to be tonight. Maybe I should make a run for it now, bust out of the wind-“I know you’re under there y/n,” Mr. Holland’s voice sung above her. It was too late now. Any escape plan that her mind frantically tried to rationalise was long gone by this point. Slowly, y/n retreated from her hiding spot to face him. He had his normal outfit of a tight t-shirt paired with a decorative tie and slightly lose pants. This time though he had a long burgundy coat draped over his shoulders. He looked like a painting. y/n smiled sheepishly. “Hi,” she said simply. Regaining her seat from before and fully appearing in front of him. “I had no idea you would be here this late,” she tried with conversation. “Harry’s my brother, I have to drive him home before leaving myself and he just wanted to work the late shift tonight,” Tom laughed to himself and he turned around and waved at Harry. His brother waved back guiltily. “You know, I could say this same to you,” he smirked at her. “I am working on your assignment, sir,” y/n responded quietly. Tom’s eyes lit up at that and he rushed to snatch the papers off her desk and into his hands. Much to the disapproval of y/n.“Oh good, you’ve decided to change it,” Tom sounded almost relieved as if he trusted her judgement more than his own. Worse of it all, he decided to sit down next to her. Even taking off his coat, making his biceps bulge through his shirt. His eyes flicked through what she currently has. His eyebrows raised in shock, “I have to say, I was not expected you to decide to do something about the female orgasm and its effect on the psyche,” his voice was an octave deeper than usual. y/n could feel her arousal building. y/n couldn’t decide if he was just being friendly or if he was trying to send a deeper message. Either way, she decided to take action. “Well, with the number of women being unsatisfied I thought it was an appropriate topic,” she snatched the papers out of his hands, “but you wouldn’t know anything about women being unsatisfied would you sir?” Tom sat there in astonishment. His cock stiffened against the restraints of his jeans, he has only been in her vicinity for 5 minutes and already she has him hard as a rock. It was times like these that he wished he could just leave all his determination to fuck her over this very desk at the door. Regrettably, he couldn’t.“Well, that just ruins the surprise,” y/n sighed delicately. Her fingers flicking through the pages of her useless book. “Either way, the resources are complete shit,” this time her sadness was real, and Tom snapped out of his lust-ridden haze. “Did you really expect a man to know mostly everything of something that is so cardinally female?” Tom smirked as he closed the book on her and pointed to the photo of a wrinkled old man. He was the author of a stupid book and to be fair, he looked like he would write this type of book as well. “Damn, I knew I was doing something wrong,” y/n hissed. She had been spending her entire night trying to piece together information from a man who can only give her half the story. “The book on the top shelf is one on the chemical effects of orgasming in females by a female,” Tom leaned in and whispered in her ear. His hot breath wafted of her skin; it was enough to send goose bumps over her entire body. y/n turned her head to face him, their lips inches away from each other. If they didn’t have Harry watching them like a hawk, they probably would be out of breath from lip-locking. Instead, y/n nodded and got up out of her seat, making sure to give him a stunning view of her tits through her tank top. He wanted to audibly gasp but kept in inside. It didn’t help with his situation downstairs any more than the last few minutes have. Slowly, she walked over to the bookcase. Her eyes scanning the endless rows and she made sure Tom had enough time to enjoy the deep red thong underneath her skirt. Finally, her fingers coiled around the book and brought it down to her. Tom couldn’t believe his own eyes. He was so under her spell. The way her top hugged her curved and let his eyes completely drink in her breasts. How her skirt was pulled up to her waist, allowing the flushed skin of her ass to be visible to him. He wonders how a woman like her even exists and yet she takes a seat next to him, absolutely unaware of his throbbing manhood. Begging to be touched by her, to be taken by her, by anything to do with her. “Thank you, sir,” she almost purrs to him, Tom’s struggling to keep it together. He afraid the next thing to slip out of her flawless mouth, he’ll cum straight into his pants when he would rather cum into her. “Anytime,” he responds just a dark before getting up. Hiding his clearly hard cock behind his briefcase. “I’ll see you in class?” He already knows the answer, but he just wants the last bit of assurance from her. “Of course,” she smiled warmly. With that Tom basically books it, he’s frantically making sure he’s well-hidden as he quickly bends over the counter. “I’ll come back to pick you up in 30, I forgot some paper work back in my office,” it’s so fast, Harry almost doesn’t have time to translate it before Tom’s out the door and rushing down the hall.At one point, he basically running to get to his office. Feet tapping against the concrete as he continues to see nothing but flashing images of y/n. It blurs his vision and he’s so desperate. He considers using a spare supply closet but know he will only get complete privacy in his own office. He finally gets there, after what seems like an eternity of running. He checks the hallways before entering. He drops all of his things at the foot of the door. He even has the decency to hang his coat upon the rack. Tom slowly walks over to his chair. It’s a rough leather material and usually he would refuse to do what he’s about to do in here, it will be stained with the memory but at this point. He got no fucks left to give. He crashes down. His back hitting the material he hates so much. He doesn’t think he’s got time, but he still does it slowly. His belt drops next to his and he undoes the zip slowly and the cold air hits his dick. He hisses at the feeling but proceeds anyways. Tom pulls the rest of his jeans and boxers down his legs and kicks them across the room. His hand takes his dick, slowly rubbing the head. Imaging y/n’s fingers dancing over it, spreading the precum over. He uses his palm to envision her own stroking up and down in an even motion. He can’t help but moan. He can’t help but softly call out her name.He so entranced that he doesn’t recognize the following light footsteps approaching. He’s so into her non-existent touch that he doesn’t hear the door peacefully squeak open. He’s so in love with the feeling he doesn’t feel y/n walk around the room to get on her knees in front of him.She’s in glory of his movements. Watching him stroke his much bigger cock than her masturbation version has her in a hurry to get her own panties off her body and across the floor. She’s sure she’s dripping onto the wood below but she does have single care in the world. Tom has his head thrown back in ecstasy as his hand starts to speed up, that’s when y/n decides to go for the kill. She licks a long strip up his shaft. Her hands stabilizing him by placing them atop his bare thighs. Tom almost jumps out of his chair. He had no idea she caught him in the middle of something so vile and wrong. Better yet, she had caught him with the tip of his dick around her perfectly glossed lips. He doesn’t get to say another word before y/n’s hands begin massaging the bottom of his manhood. It’s slow to begin with, it’s almost if she’s easing him into it. Her cheeks hollow out to allow his length into her warm mouth. It’s incredible. Tom can’t help but buck his hips up into her throat causing her to gag slightly. It’s a sound he wants more of. His hands ball her hair into his fist. With the faster her movements become, the harder he fucks into her mouth. They sync up almost instantly. One of y/n’s hands leave his cock to fuck herself. Tom’s mesmerised by the way her fingers act as a replacement for his dick. He’s certain he’s not going to last much longer. “I should be d-doing that,” he whispers through grunts. y/n lifts her head to smile at him, still letting her free hand jerk and pull bringing him closer the edge. “I know,” she responds, just as quiet. Her mouth reconnects but Tom quickly snaps his hips up into her. Her muffled moaning vibrated against his cock as he fucks her mouth. It’s the hottest thing he’s ever done. He tugs and pulls at her hair, y/n’s edging him on. She’s exquisite, it’s like she’s mastered this and has allowed him to chance to feel how fucking beautiful her little mouth can be. Like it’s effortless, he comes. Without any warning, he is shooting hot stream of cum into her mouth, filling it up. Tom swears he’s seeing stars but can’t bring him to call out her name but instead bites down on his hand so hard he’s afraid he’s drawn blood. y/n releases him from her mouth and is from an actual porn Tom spent his teenage years watching, his cum leaks from her lips and falls down on the curves of her tits. It’s a sight he was to remember forever. He wants to grab his phone and click so he will get to look at her covered in his cum for the rest of his life but alas, he’s still regaining his bearings. “Tastes better than I would have expected,” y/n giggles as she brings the liquid back up to her lips and swallows. There is no way this woman gets better; he thinks to himself. “Sweetheart-,” he begins but she beats him to it, her gets back on her feet and plants a sweet kiss upon his lips. He can taste himself on her lips, it’s addictive. “I wanted this,” it’s almost as if she read his mind. He doesn’t respond but he simply looks at her, his hand coming up to twirl a strand of hair that has fallen in front of her face. y/n pulls away from him, walking over the pile of discarded clothes and bend to pick up her soaked underwear. She gives Tom a look, he’s so close he can smell her juices from his seat. Her pussy look like a paradise waiting to be exploded by him, but he keeps his hands to himself. y/n paced herself over to the coat hanger, her folded panties in hand. She places them in the left pocket with a devilish smile upon her face. Tom had now place their rest of his clothes back on and had joined her. “I’ll get them back next lesson,” y/n grins. Tom nods quickly, their feet fumbling under her back hits his office door. She’s trapped in between him, he smells of pure sex but she’s committed to her idea. He bends down to capture her lips in his with a forceful kiss. It’s hungry and needy. She wants it so badly to give but she pulls away. “My roommate is waiting for me outside.”“We’ll finish this,” Tom whispers as he opens the door for her. It sends shivers down y/n’s spine. It’s not a promise, it’s an order. She grabs the rest of her things and heads off. Almost in a sick turn of events, Tom watches her bare ass strut away from him. Just like the last lesson, except this time all he can do is imagine him face fucking her. It’s a beautiful sight.━━★✼☆｡The three days leading up to class where probably the slowest 72 hours both of them had ever experienced. A constant detail of pleasure from the night before. So when the fated day arrived, both parties didn’t know what to do. Tom debated just staying home, though he couldn’t deny he so desperately want just another taste. He thought, if he didn’t show up, all his guilty conscience of a student giving him the best head he’s ever had in his life would simply disappear and he would go back to being a normal teacher. y/n, too, thought of skipping this class for a completely different reason. Perhaps she had got a surge of confidence after hearing her professor call out her name while he touched himself or it could just be the pure scandalous nature of it all. Either way, she wanted to stay cooped up with a blanket while she watched him unravelled. No matter the psyche from the both of them, they went. y/n stood outside the classroom for a good 20 minutes, unsure of what she should do. Should she go in now and fuck him in the small window or wait and play with his emotions? She hadn’t realised how fast the time had went until she saw other student’s start entering. It was now or never and unfortunately it was going to be now. The room was smaller than y/n remember when she stepped in. It seemed more wide the last time she came in here. Of course, the last time she came in her, she hadn’t sucked Mr. Holland’s cock. Her eyes landed on him in a matter of seconds. His back was turned to her as he wrote on the massive blackboard in front of him. y/n could see his muscles flex as he tried to reach for the duster above the board. She bit her lip as she thought of her nails digging into his back as he fucked her. It was a fantasy she had to push to the side. Tom could practically smell her once she walked in. It was her normal perfume that had been intensified 10 fold. He refuses to turn around, afraid that if he did all his good heart nature would go out the window. Tom could hear the faint clinking of the heels of her shoes walk up the stairs. He so desperately wanted them to come right back down. “Okay, as you know, you’re assignment is due in 2 weeks and this is going to be the only time I will answer your questions,” Tom’s voice boomed. He hadn’t got a lot of sleep since that night and he didn’t particularly want to do this but he considered himself a kind professor, so he had too. He turned around and saw the entire class’ hands go straight up in the air. Including y/n, though hers was a little lower. Her eyebrow raised and a small smirk painted on her lips. There was no way in hell he was answer whatever question came out of those pretty lips. She looked even more exquisite than when he last saw her. A tight t-shit that had a stained 50’s logo on it and a pair of tight black jeans, he knew as soon as he spoke to her, he would loose all control on himself.So he never did, constantly dodging her. Answering every single question, even if half of them were if he was married or worse if he was free Friday night. He will admit, seeing y/n get frustrated every time he passed her to talk to another young female student made him just that tad bit excited. It was an hour and a half of pure tension. Sure, no one else in the class could feel it but they 100% could. She never felt more out of control and for some reason, she despised it. He kept ignoring her, kept refusing her, kept defying her. It was infuriating, that she wanted to take fate by the hair. She waited, until every single soul had walked out of the door. She waited until the last gaggle of girls had finished their blabbering to Tom before she starting to strut down the stairs. Tom refused to meet her eyes even when he knew that’s all she did. Glare at him as she stomped past him desk to the classroom door. He heard it lock. “I wanted to ask you a question,” she almost spat, “sir.” Tom straightened himself before swivelled around to meet her. She was so livid with him but he knew deep down that all she wanted from him was to have the white chalk from the board rubbed up her back from him pinning her down. “Fire away,” he responded exactly the same. She stared at him for a moment before strolling towards him. She made sure to swing her hips every other time. She noticed his eyes on her, finally she was getting somewhere. y/n pressed her chest upon his heaving one. Her face lifting to meet his. They stayed like that for a good minute, just pondering. They listened to each other’s heats thumping against their rib cages. They both desperately needed this. Never taking her eyes off him, y/n snaked her hand around the side of pocket of her coat, smiling once she found what she left. Her soaked red thong, it was a sight for sore eyes. “I wanted to ask if I was every going to get payback?” she giggled softly. Tom knew she was playing a game but he had no idea which one it was.“I don’t think I understand,” he stammered, she strutted away from him until she met the edge of his stainless desk. Her fingers gliding over the wood ever so slightly. She turned her head to look at him. She had a rawness in her eyes; lustful, a sinner’s stare. It would be a look Tom was never forget for the rest of his life.y/n suddenly jumped on the desk. Her ass moving the papers to the side as she slowly started to unbutton her tight jeans. “I think you do,” it was almost a hiss but he only heard the desperation in her voice. “I want you to make me feel all the things you did that night.”Tom almost fainted just with that until she dropped her jeans the floor. She had come to class without any underwear on and her wetness was dripping onto the desk. Tom was sure was in heaven but he didn’t want to believe it. He got on his knees. His hands palming at her soft thighs. Tom didn’t need another incentive, he didn’t need another spur-on. Tom licked a single strip up her folds, y/n bit a moan back. It was like tasting ambrosia or doing cocaine for the first time. He needed more, so he went back in again, this time it was rougher. His fingers gripping at her ass, pulling her closer to his mouth as he devoured as if he hadn’t eaten in weeks. Her hands tangle themselves in his floppy curls, she tugs harshly on his scalp as he adds a finger into her warm entrance. Tom’s never felt like this before but he doesn’t care. He’s sure people can hear her soft but frantic moaning from outside, but he doesn’t care. He’ll never look at his desk the same way but like everything else, he doesn’t fucking care. Tom curls his fingers in the perfect spot inside of her. “Just like that,” y/n calls out, her hair now sprawled out on the desk. “I’m going to cum sir.”Tom feels her walls contract around his fingers as he pulsing faster, her back arches and she trying so hard to force her cries back into her throat. It’s a sight he wants to from above, it’s a feeling he wants to feel inside of her. So, at the last minute, he retracts everything. His tongue leaves her throbbing clit and his finger, which are glistening with her slick, slid out of her. y/n can’t hold back to whine that leaves her left from the loss of his god-like tongue and fingers. “What the fuck Tom?!” she’s angry with him, she wants to tell him off but before she can do it. One of his hands captures her wrist and slams them against the desk below her, pinning her to it. She whimpers at the sting of pain. He’s right above her but she can’t see a single thing below her. “Look at me,” he tells her sternly, she does what’s she is told instantly. “You can’t talk to me like that sweetness,” y/n knows there is a venom behind his words even if she speaks in a melody. “I’m not your fucking boyfriend, you don’t call me that.” Without any warning at all, he pounds right up into her. y/n almost spasms out of Tom’s grip from the wave of pleasure. Tom doesn’t move at all, he stays nuzzled inside her. It’s agonising, almost painful for y/n. Having his perfect cock not jamming into her tight cunt. It’s torture. “You understand that?” he peppers kissed against the nape of her neck, she’s about to cry out, she’ll do anything. She nods her head frantically, hoping it’s enough. It isn’t. He keeps his hips locked tightly against hers. “Words, sweetness.”“Yes,” she responds. She can feel him frown against her skin. He pulls right out of her and rams right back in, causing y/n to scream out in pleasure. “Y-yes sir,” she corrects herself and with that, Tom starts a pace. It’s slow and tantalising, he watches amazed at how her pretty folds swallow him up with every thrust. It’s magnificent.He wants to savour this moment forever. He wants to fuck her brains out for every waking moment of his existence. “Sir, go harder,” she moans below him. Her wrists bruised from his gripped, but the pain just only contributes in her overwhelming amount of pleasure. His thick cock is so much better than her fingers, no matter how many she adds. Tom obliges and starts to really pound into her cunt. It’s raw and ruthless, he’s calling out her name now. “Fuck sweetness, you so bloody tight,” he purrs, y/n can’t respond through her chant of curses. “You’re little cunt was made for me, it was made for me to stretch it out.”The dirty talk elevates her, y/n’s not sure how much longer she’ll last. His filling ever last inch of her. She can feel her tits bounce every time their skin collides. Her wrists are finally let free as he begins to clutch at her naked hips. It’s an experience she’s never felt. The sound of skin slapping and their combined gasping and cursing are the only thing she can perceive to hear. If there was a knock at the door, y/n knows she would have no idea about it. Perhaps, it’s the pure excitement and morality of this whole situation that makes them both feel like they’re on cloud nine. Her arms snake around his waist, her hands move with every rough thrust into her. She’s gripping onto his back through the material of his tight shirt. Her nails clasping on the contracting muscles. She would have left his back red and sore if he didn’t have the damned t-shirt on to protect him. “Fuck,” she curses as he started to hit an area inside of her, she never knew existed. “Just like that sir, I am going to cum,” she moans, her forehead against his. They lock eyes again, this time though there is no linger feeling of want or romance. It’s just sex. Dirty, hot, intense fucking. She’s the first to come undone. The fire now transformed into a raging wildfire spreading across her entire abdomen. y/n throws her head back in ecstasy, her whole vision goes black and she has to bit down against her hand to stop and inevitable pornographic scream to jump out of her mouth. Her other hand clutches his neck, pulling him closer to her. Tom follows shortly after, his thrusts become sloppy and erratic but never easing up. His cock twitches inside of her before he shots the hot white liquid all inside of her cunt. He pressed his lips against her as his attempt to stop his moan as well but he continues to call out her angelic name against her lips. Once, Tom pulls out of her, he watches in awe. The mixture leaks out of her hole and then pools on his desk. He’s so in love with this woman it hurts. “I have never cum that hard in my entire fucking life,” she giggles, pulling her top down her flushed tits. As he too, starts to redress himself, he simply stares at her. Watches her retrieve her jeans from the floor and slip them up her bare ass. He spots her shove her panties back into his back pocket, not before she scribbles something down on a torn piece of paper. “What are you doing?” he asked gently, wrapping his arms around her waist. She nuzzles her face in the crook of her. “I’m giving you a reason to come make me dinner and then fuck me again,” she explains, “I put my address in there, so hopefully you can’t get lost.” “You sure about this,” Tom asked hesitantly, y/n now swivelled around to face him. Her warm palm caressed his face. “I wouldn’t have just done that if I wasn’t,” she places a soft, tender kiss to his cheek. “Make it a Thursday though, my roommate will be out on those nights,” she told him as he grabbed the last of her things and unlocked the door. Tom grins warmly as she makes herself presentable for the last time. “I would clean that up if I were you,” y/n laughed, pointing at the obvious mess all over his desk before quickly exiting. As she wobbled back to her dorm, she wondered what article of clothing she should leave out on their next escapade. ━━★✼☆｡a/n: this is gonna flop, i just fuckin know it 🥴 anways i hope you enjoyed my fic that has ended my hiatus. see you (hopefully) soon 🥺

Bucky: Listen, if I can manage to be alive after almost over 70 years, got my left arm chopped off, bleed internally. Get Brain wash by Hydra, kill innocent lives during my Winter Soldier angst days. Almost killed Steve, ripped a steering wheel off from Sam’s car, shot Natasha on the shoulder. Became a US most top criminal after the bombing—which wasn’t me because I was framed. Then manage to fight a quarter of the Avengers in an airport. Then proceed to get help by a secretive—which is not secretive at all anymore-kingdom. Then got called because another war is happening by some intergalactic dried grapefruit wants to collect color stones. Died because the dried grapefruit snap his jazzy fingers. Then woke up realize it’s been 5 years after that. Then your best friend leaves you for some chick he barley took out on a date and left you with the metal bird you rip the steering wheel off from. Then I’m positive you can pass your driving test. :) Peter, who stands in front of the DMV, holding papers against his chest with a horrified look: …Sam: Man…I gotta stop taking you out to public places…

            ‘Vibe’ Check        Peter Parker x readerSummary: You decide to get a vibrator and use it for the first time, however you get a little….stuck and Peter comes to help. Warning: SMUT, FLITHYYYY, language, fluffA/N: If you know what’s in the back of Spencer’s then you know. Your not someone that gets close with other people, because what’s the point if you already have three close friends, one being an avenger. But somehow you ended up at the mall with your theater friends. “Have you ever been to Spencers??” Kayla asked you as you walked past the brick store.“Yea?” You said remembering one time you went in n out. “Have you been to the back?” Sammie asked with a smirk. Your theater friends were, what would you say….spontaneous. You were stage manager for the Midtown play. The actors were a lot to handle, but they were still fun to hangout. So when Kayla, Sammie, Jordy and Nat asked you to come to the mall after rehearsal, you did. But these girls were much more open, and you got insecure, which doesn’t happen often, but they were much more…experienced then you were. Keep reading
