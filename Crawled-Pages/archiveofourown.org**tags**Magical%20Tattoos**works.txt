    Summary
      Derek has heard stories about the Spark -ghe kind of stories that would have his younger self cowering under the blankets. The kind of stories that had Derek stick close to the pack.But when Derek is in trouble, and the pack isnt around, Derek finds himself in the care of said Spark, and he finds out fairly quickly that he's not all he seems to be.Stiles, he finds out, isn't a villain at all. Derek's only heard one side of the story for four years, and now it's time for him to hear the other side from his mate.*-*"Pretty little wolf," he hummed, stepping closer and kneeling beside Derek. Even in his death fogged brain, he recognized the words spoken. The words that were tattooed along his hip bone.The man reached a hand out, long bony fingers brushing against Derek's jaw. That's when recognition dawned on him. He knew this boy -not personally, but he'd seen pictures. This was the Spark. The one Scott had warned him about since Derek had returned to Beacon Hills four years ago. His mate."Fuck me," Derek gasped out, dropping his head on the step."Let's get you better, first, shall we, Puppy?" The Spark hummed.

      it all began on a gloomy night.(chan disagrees, argues that it started during a bright, sunny day, but that doesn’t matter. it’s jisung’s story, and he’ll start from wherever he wants.)

    Summary
      Draco twisted it between his fingers... back and forth. The metal wasn’t particularly unique in appearance, it was actually rather plain. Yet, the piece had been discovered in the corpse of Hogwarts. Amongst the ruins of his former house, in the dungeons. It bore his family crest. Curious. No jewels adorning it, one of the many faceless minions brought it to him hoping for favor. Everyone recognized the Malfoy crest, feared it. He glanced briefly at the crumpled mass bleeding out on his floor, smirking. Favor indeed. He would need to refer to his father, ask what he knew. How had it been buried there? Who’s had it been? He sensed power pulsing. Curious. His mind wandered back to the blood and smoke of that final battle, the day the Dark Lord rose and conquered... the day hope died. The day many good men, women, and child soldiers fell... that Harry Potter was frozen within Amber... when Granger vanished. Most believed she was dead, but years later, Draco somehow knew she was alive and kicking somewhere. He’d keep orders current for her capture, to be brought directly to him. She’d be alone now... he almost pitied the survivors. His own guilt ate at him enough. The silver almost felt warm.

    Summary
      Not many would look at Newt and see him as any sort of threat, they would see him as someone that was a bit of an airhead, that he was shy, awkward and hardly a blip on the danger metre. Little did anyone know, but a select few, just how different Newt really was to those views.

    Summary
      Park Jimin expects life to be normal now that he is no longer orphaned, moving to the big city with his younger sister in hopes of finding a better life. There's only one tiny problem: a boy with a lightning bolt mark on his ankle that seems to move around his body, and a strangely beautiful raven that takes flight as soon as Jimin realizes something is terribly wrong.

    Summary
      Harry gets something on his 16th birthday that he did not expect and his world is turned completely upside down. He discovered both truth and lies, enemies become allies and people he once trusted becomes enemies. Harry's now got something he never had before, a choice to make his own path in life. Dumbledore bashing. Ron bashing and him being a little bit of an arse. Malfoy is a friend.

    Summary
      For years Geralt searched, between raising Ciri and hunting monsters, he’d torn the world apart and found nothing but his own memories. Jaskier hadn't just vanished, it was as if the bard had never existed at all. No magic could track him, not even a body could be found. But his music still played, sung in every tavern on The Continent, haunting him, reminding him of what he had lost. Then Jaskier returned, broken and transformed. Body crisscrossed with threads of spellwork burned deep through flesh and mind. Magic flowing instead of blood in his veins.

    Summary
      Luke has more important things to worry about than finding his soulmate. He’s only 17 and not interested in “settling with a nice girl” like his mother keeps telling him to do. Things like getting Sunset Curve a record deal, figuring out his issues with his parents in therapy and maybe even passing all his classes to graduate on time next year.But then she walks into chemistry and suddenly the little handwritten quote on his rib doesn’t seem so pointless anymore.Julie moves to a new school half way through the year and between playing catch up and trying to convince everyone she's fine, she doesn't have time to worry about the cute boy in her chem class or why he keeps looking at her like she holds the world in her hands.

    Summary
      The problem rises, not when he’s checking for chest hair, but when he’s eyeballing his treasure trail and sure enough there is a problem. Not like a sprouting hair and an inappropriate boner problem, that’s just puberty, not a problem. The problem is, well, it’s a welcome mat. Or a lower abdomen tattoo. A welcome mat. And that is just, swell. That is swell. It is glowing, not like a real black ink tattoo put there with needles, not a red or orange or any color of the rainbow tattoo that is put there in a parlor by a trained professional. Or even one that was bought at half price and put on with a dirty needle in an alley somewhere. Or even one that was burned on by Derek freaking Hale in his loft after attempting to get a legitimate tattoo in a parlor and having it heal!Nope. Not that. None of those options.Nope.--------------Stiles has a magical book, visits a magical floor in the library and ends up with a magical tattoo.  Oh, and he accidentally fed the Nemeton for a few years.  Oops.
