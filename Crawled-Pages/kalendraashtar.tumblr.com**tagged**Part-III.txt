Chemotherapy Tuesday, I feel
uncharacteristically hopeful, not necessarily in a cure for my illness, but in
a resolution for that debilitating feeling of disconnect. When you’re
diagnosed, it feels a bit like yielding a very sharp knife, cutting all the
tethers that anchor you to life, to a sense of self and to normalcy. For once,
life is calling me from that place, instead of looming death. When
I enter the room, he is already there, this time cradling his own tablet like an
infant’s head in his big palm. I wave in greeting and he smiles back
momentarily, but keeps reading, thoroughly enthralled. Pterodactyl (small, quirky and slightly unnerving)
comes to plug me in and I expect Jamie to initiate conversation, just as he did
the day before. His eyes are fixed on the screen, wide and still-lake blue, and
by the look on his face he might be reading The
Book of Revelation.I
try to distract myself by looking at the treatment room’s decoration - or lack thereof -, remarkably naked of
gimcrack and gewgaw, with a sole picture of a sunny field occupying the large
wall. I guess there’s no point in trying to make such a place more suitable for
the living; cancer ruins any attempt at proper feng shui. “No
chit-chat today, huh?” I tease after a while, hopelessly eager to be standing
in the sun of his smiling blue eyes yet again. “‘Tis
the most engrossing read, Sassenach.”
He nods gravely and smiles in a way that makes my solar plexus do a full spin,
his handsome face like a pinch in between ribs, straight into the frailty
amidst bone. A dark suspicion that he’s reading the complete works of LadyCurlyWig_1 creeps in, and I’m both
mortified and elated. I
purse my lips, decided to be the coolest
of cool, eyeing the drip of chemo as I tap my index finger against my thigh
rhythmically. My eyes keep seeking his face (the scar on his temple the size of my thumb’s nail, the patches of
blonde stubble on his jaw, the tiny mole on the back of his right ear) and
I notice the puzzled frown of his brows as soon as it dawns, the way his mouth
opens and closes in quick succession.“Your
cogs must be rusty,” I point sheepishly, playing with my earring. “I
can hear them turning from over here.” Continuar a ler

amiably, pointing him in the direction of a plush burgundy armchair in front of

thumbing through my Instagram
account, where she had invited herself to peek into last night’s dinner party.
Geillis had tagged me on a photograph of her and Frank, holding each other by
the waist, thanking all her friends for their presence. “They make such a nice
couple.”I uttered a guttural sound that could pass for agreement, while I
perilously painted my toenails in black, struggling to balance the bottle of
nail polish on my leg. It was lovely to have her around - I was thrilled every
time she announced a visit to Aberdeen; but in all truth her capacity to read
the hidden letters within me was quite worrisome, given how much I was trying
to hide. “How is Jamie?” My mother froze on the last picture I had posted on
my profile, taken surreptitiously by John, showing Jamie and I dancing
together. My face seemed on the verge of splitting in two from laughing, my
cheeks flushed red and my hair curling madly around my shoulders. “Good.” My tongue peeked
through my teeth, as I frowned in deep concentration. “I invited him over for
dinner, but he’s working tonight. Maybe he can come tomorrow.” I raised my eyes
and caught the glimpse of an enigmatic smile on her face. “What?”

                            Fanfiction - Scalpel &amp; Needle II
                            I haven’t used many canon quotes in this story and that has been a conscient decision. I made an exception for this chapter. I hope this makes sense to some, as it made to me.Scalpel &amp; Needle(Arc I: Incision), PreviouslyScalpel &amp; Needle IIPart III - TethersSlowly but surely Jamie started to come undone. Claire had nonchalantly proposed that he took a few days to rest before going back to work at the Royal Infirmary, a dash of assertive-Chief-of-Surgery mixed with cool-but-concerned-girlfriend; undoubtedly the strains of a long trip, months of malnourishment and bone-deep tiredness called for a proper vacation. All those things were true, of course, but during that time Claire planned to watch him carefully for any signs of an impending meltdown. At first it had been a small thing here and there. Jamie had developed a furious distaste for any type of wasted food, becoming cranky and annoyed when some leftovers could still be found in the pan after their dinner. He ate with the frugality of a Tibetan monk, completely devoided of his previous enthusiastic enjoyment of food, managing to turn any meal into a tiresome task. Claire did her best to swallow every last crumb, even if it meant becoming indisposed afterwards and having to redouble her workouts.He had barely gained any weight back since his arrival. Jamie paraded around his flat in his old clothes, looking like a child wearing his father’s shirt. The sight caused Claire tremendous heartache, but Jamie had forbidden any attempts at spending money buying him new things. So, he went on, a walking allegory for a man whose life had ceased to fit altogether.When they went shopping together for supplies for their respective houses, he markedly pursed his lips anytime Claire grabbed for a slightly expensive hair conditioner or extravagant tropical produce. On more than one occasion, Claire had to bite the inside of her cheek and clench her teeth, counting to ten – or a hundred - inside her head, in lieu of bashing his head with a passion fruit. He was clearly troubled, yet uncapable of meeting his uncanny attitudes with proper words to explain himself. Jamie slept fitfully with the lights turned off, spending the majority of the night getting up from bed, where she pretended to sleep, to look through the window or wander across the living room, adjusting picture frames or reorganizing perfectly ordered books. One night, Claire simply left the soft corner lamp turned on, pretending to have forgotten it by accident, and he managed to sleep almost the entire night, smoothing somewhat the deep dark circles around his disturbed blue eyes. He toggled between meticulously avoiding any footage playing on the television relating to Syria and a fevered examination of newspapers and death counts. It was a duality that left her reeling, unsure about the right way to proceed around him. It seemed like a reluctant Adso had become his favourite interlocutor – possibly for the lack of any coherent response or human reproach – and Claire would sometimes hear the male surgeon in another division, speaking quietly in Gaelic to the unperturbed feline. But his dreams – his dreams talked when he couldn’t. After making love to Claire with a distance that made her feel unseen, avoiding her eyes even if his touches talked about utter tenderness and worship, he would retreat to a land where he could punish himself freely. The small noises he made were the shards of words, broken inside him and struggling to get out, bleeding him until his skin was dead cold. The night seemed to have too may hours and the room too many shadows, all of them for each to endure alone.The first time Jamie told her something significant about the past few months, he was inside the shower, his voice partially muffled by the running water. Claire was sitting on the toilet – it had been an imperative urgency, otherwise she wasn’t fond of sharing such intimacies – and he just started talking. “There was a wee lad there.” He said above the splatter of droplets and shampoo. “He must have been no older than three years. His whole family was already dead – sarin, I think. I bagged him for over two hours, because the last ventilator available was under a pile of rubble. My arms were so tired, Claire. So tired. I tried to keep going for as long as I could. Eventually I had to stop. I stopped, aye?”Claire had to put her closed fist inside her own mouth to stop herself from sobbing aloud. When she thought her voice might be steady enough, she whispered a gentle “But you tried. It wasn’t you fault, Jamie.”The next revelation came late one night, when she was doing dishes, the kitchen lights dim. Adso was sitting on the corner next to his new feeder, looking partially hypnotized by her movements, his eyes closing and opening like a traffic light. The female surgeon knew Jamie was standing behind her, looking at her intently, as if he could plant all those memories inside her head for her to examine, without the need for him to actually verbalize them.“There is no respect for civilian life there. No respect for life whatsoever.” He inhaled sharply. “The hospital got shelled quite a few times. One of those times I was in the middle of a surgery and refused to leave when they came to evacuate us. I took a bit of shrapnel.” That confirmed her suspicions about the scar under his shoulder blade. The glass she was scrubbing almost shattered under the force of her gripping hands. “It healed quickly enough.” A pause, just a little too long. There were moments I wished it didn’t.”Claire’s breath hitched on her throat. She forced herself to remain composed, a neutral detachment that would keep him talking. “Is this why you are punishing yourself?” She asked delicately. “Because you are alive?”“I’m not punishing myself.” Jamie retorted, his voice harsher than usual. Claire turned to face him, absorbedly cleaning her hands on the yellowish dish towel. For once, his eyes didn’t shy away from her. “Really? Because it surely looks like it from where I’m standing.” Her voice came out soft, in spite of her bluntness. “You refrain from eating, you do nothing that truly gives you pleasure.” Her hawk-like eyes studied him intently. “You’re acting like a ghost. Are you pretending to be dead until it actually happens?”Jamie clenched his jaw and Claire could have sworn she heard his teeth protesting. He breathed deeply – once, twice – and them most of the tension disappeared, leaving only his growing vulnerability. “My car could cover for a new ventilator.” He whispered, carefully looking around him, as if such thoughts had been a recurring occurrence. “The stereo on the living room – a few rounds of intravenous antibiotics. That jacket there – enough sterile compresses to pack a few until they reach surgery.” Jamie’s eyes searched hers, a despair so great it made her queasy. “How can I ken such things and go on living as I must?”“Your life didn’t cost them their own.” Claire tentatively reached for him, touching his forearm, where veins and tendons were visible under his skin. “It’s war, Jamie. It’s senseless. You aren’t killing them by allowing yourself a reprieve, or some small joy. You are not the butterfly causing the tornado on the other side of the world.”“I want to touch ye.” Jamie admitted, his voice unhinged. “But I feel so guilty, Claire. Every ounce of happiness seems like a crime committed against those I left there. Like I’ve started to forget them, just so I can live in peace.”Claire came around him, speechless, and hugged him from behind, her palms making sure his heart had truly come home inside his chest. They stayed there, swaying gently together – Jamie like an overbeaten tree crying to the skies and Claire his embracing wind, holding his branches in her soft breeze, her will the roots to keep him grounded. But none of those pieces he reluctantly shed could compare to the one they came upon, one brisk afternoon, looking at a few pictures on his phone. Jamie had been sharing with her images from a couple of surgeries he did overseas, names whispered with devotion and respect, when the screen suddenly showed a different reality.It was an innocent picture by all standards. He was still more of the man she remembered, with a kind of soft glow that always made her think of sunny days; the woman next to him was a brunette with gentle eyes, her face made prettier by the absolute kindliness that exuded from her smile. It reminded Claire of those sapient animals inhabiting ancient forests. His arm was loosely around her shoulders and they were smiling to the camera. “Who is she?” Claire asked calmly. Inside her a sense of profound direness grew, but she couldn’t afford to break just yet. Without truly knowing. “She is quite beautiful.”“Mary.” Jamie pronounced softly. Her name on his lips didn’t sound like an entire world, as Claire’s often did when he chose to address her so; it didn’t appear like a star he had just discovered and secretly named just for himself. Still, his quiet hesitancy gave her pause. “She is a nurse, went there with the Doctors Without Borders for a full year. She is a remarkable lass.”Claire swallowed hard – saliva, bile, unshed tears. Her index finger nervously rubbed his knuckle. “Tell me about her?”“Aye.” He nodded, closing his eyes. “I think I have to. We got along verra well, especially after we were both stationed in Raqqa. Mary was the only person I felt like I could talk to during those days. We leaned on each other.”“Did you - sleep with her?” Claire asked flatly. She felt very distant from her own body, as if her lips were being maneuvered by a ventriloquist. A very masochist one.   “No.” His eyes bore into hers, so she could take whatever she wanted from them. “But she did kiss me, Claire – and I let her.”It wasn’t the wave of anger she had expected. Claire didn’t think of slapping him, screaming, scratching his face or even getting up and leave. She simply sat there, feeling like a vacant space, void. Robbed.“Why?” She muttered. Her hands felt very empty and she suddenly craved the feel of a retractor and vascular clamp in her hands. “Were – are you in love with her?”“No.” Jamie brushed his slender face, sounding thoroughly broken. Claire didn’t dare to look for moistness on his cheeks. “It wasna like that. It had been a very hard week for us, the city was getting hit almost hourly. We were losing patients even before we had time to triage them. I didna even ken the names of the people I was treating – there was no time for gentleness or to feel anything, really. Just loss.” He stopped, covering his eyes with his palms. “With Mary I wanted to feel – kind. I wanted to feel kindness and be sure I still could. That I hadn’t died without even noticing it.”“Sometimes a kiss is just a kiss and sometimes a kiss is a tether to life.” Claire whispered, fidgeting with her fingers. Her eyes remained stubbornly dry. Everything felt dry, barren, desolated. “You told me that, once. Mary was your tether.” Not me.“I wanted to tell ye.” He promised in a hoarse voice. “But how can I tell you these things and expect ye to believe that I’ve never loved anyone but ye? How can I show ye how broken I am and beg ye to still want me?”“Is that the reason why you can’t look at me when you touch me? Or why you stopped calling me?” Claire asked with urgency, raising from the couch and pacing around the room. “Because you were ashamed?” She looked outside, to the fog covering Edinburgh like a cloak of cold quietness. It might have reached her heart. “I thought you were dead!” Her voice broke just a little on that final word. “Communications didn’t work most of the time.” Jamie assured her, pressing his hands together. “And when they eventually did – well, I thought it for the best that ye might presume me dead. I thought I might never come back, to expose ye to this wrecked thing I’ve become.” His breathing came out in a rasp. “I am sorry, Claire. For everything.”“Rationally, I can understand everything you are saying.” Claire murmured, crossing her arms against the sight of him. “But I can’t be here right now. I need to leave.”“Do as ye must.” Jamie looked at her with hooded eyes. Encouraging her to go, away away away from him.“I need to know one last thing. Please, Jamie, give me your honesty in this.” She grabbed her bag and walked towards the door of his house. “Would you have forgotten me in time?” Claire asked, her tone no more than a whisper in the growing shadows between them. Her hand was pressed against the doorknob until the metal almost marked her soft skin, erasing the lines of her palm.“That amount of time doesna exist.” Jamie answered, tears moistening his eyelashes, before she closed the door behind her.

                            Fanfiction - Scalpel &amp; Needle
                            PreviouslyScalpel &amp; NeedlePart III – The Enemy of my FoeWhile quite some time had passed since the last
time Claire Beauchamp had been kissed, she clearly recalled that awkwardness
wasn’t a significant trait of a mind-blowing smack on the lips. It was supposed
to make you forget things, not enlist you to relive a harrowing past. Placing a hand on his chest she pushed him away,
gently but firmly, raising a brow in inquisition. The lights had softened once
the last song faded and Claire realized his eyes weren’t brown, as she had
thought, but instead a deep bottomless grey.  “I don’t think our acquaintance in the last
five minutes can really justify a saliva exchange.” She said jokingly, trying
to break his noticeable embarrassment. “I’m sorry.” He brushed his face with long,
pale, fingers. A charming rosy tone was blooming on his cheeks. “I dinna ken
what got into me. I was just thinking how lovely ye are and I acted like an
arse before I could stop myself.”“No harm done.” Claire patted his shoulder in sympathy,
maintaining a respectful distance just in case he was prone to more acts of
recklessness. “The heat, some whiskey and cheesy music can do that to a person.
I’m Claire by the way.”Before the stranger could open his mouth to reciprocate
with his name, she felt a slight tap on her shoulder. “Is something amiss?”  James Fraser inquired, his imposing arms
crossed against his chest. His mouth was pressed into a fine line. “Doctor Beauchamp?”“I’m fine, Fraser.” Claire replied dryly,
throwing him a quizzical gaze. “Just having a pleasant evening. You should go
back to your…erm…company.”“Hello, James.” The dark-haired man greeted
Jamie with a mordant tone. None of his previous warmth or gentleness could be
found within his eyes. “Didn’t expect to find ye here.”“That makes two of us, Tom.” Jamie said between
teeth. His piercing blue eyes quickly glanced at Tom’s hand, still comfortably placed
on Claire’s waist. “Ye were working in Glasgow, the last I heard about it.”“Ah.” He smiled almost politely, but there was
still plenty of sourness in the lines of his face. “I was invited to move here.
I’m the new head of Psychiatry at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.”“You two know each other?” Claire crossed her
arms, waiting for further explanation that neither offered willingly. “We are
surgeons at the Royal Infirmary…Tom,
is it?”“Aye.” Tom nodded, finally letting go of her
waist, his fingers drifting slowly away. “My name is Tom Christie. We were
classmates in Medical School, James and I. Very interesting times.” His lopsided
smile was almost frightening and his lead-coloured eyes glistened, like cursed
jewels. “It’s getting rather late, Claire.” She glared
at Jamie in surprise, given his previous history of avoiding her first name, a
curtsy that she promptly imitated. “Ye have that important surgery tomorrow.
Maybe we should be going.”“What do you mean by “we”?” Claire marked the word with a vague gesture of quotation
marks. “We live close to each other.” Jamie said defensively
and shrugged, his neck acquiring a faint tone of red. “We might as well walk
together”.“I’d be most happy to take Claire home.” Tom
offered, the tip of his fingers slightly brushing the back of her hand in
enticement.“I don’t really need a chaperone.” She
explained in a clipped tone to both men, rolling her eyes. “And I don’t recall
us ever walking together more than a hallway, Fraser. Besides, aren’t you already
booked tonight?” Claire smirked in distaste and pointed to one of the nurses,
clearly looking for Jamie through the small crowd gathered at the dance floor. “I’ll
get Geillis and head home. Good night, Doctor Fraser. See you around, Tom.”And she marched decidedly to look for her friend,
before the redheaded woman could find a suitable victim for the night, leaving
Claire stranded.***Thank God – or the deities of the gruelling OR
schedule – the break room was blissfully empty and quiet. Claire sighed and let
her forehead lean against the freshness of her locker’s door. She had slept
fitfully, her dreams filled with phantom kisses which left her lips numb and
cold, and betrayed blue eyes. Jamie’s behaviour the previous night had been puzzling;
his hostility against Tom was palpable and utterly mutual, supplanting even
their traditional bickering. But what truly baffled her was the way he
seemingly had tried to protect her in some way – to make sure she got away from
Tom at lightspeed.Claire opened her locker in search of some
aspirin for her headache and some deodorant, since her surgery had lasted what
seemed like a lifetime, and she felt sticky and uncomfortable. A thick yellowish
paper flew from her shelf, landing on her blue sneakers.It was one of Scalpel’s drawings, she recognized immediately. When she turned the
paper, Claire gasped audibly. As if she was looking into a strange mirror,
capable of showing beyond her appearance into her very own soul, Scalpel had
managed to portray the likeness of her eyes. The mixture of the yellow paper and
pencil had captured the intense and generous butterscotch of her eyes. Framed
by unruly curls, she could tell he had caught her on the verge of laughing,
when the current of happiness coursed though her veins to ignite the engine of
her smile. Battling an overwhelming sense of vulnerability
and the tears threatening to form in her eyes, she quickly read his brief words.“Needle, I think the time has
come for us to meet in person. A month from now, I’ll be at your door. Will you
open it?Scalpel.”

                            My girl @marlosbooknook had her birthday
a couple of days ago and I couldn’t leave her without a wee gift. You deserve
everything that is awesome, sweets! Also, thank you @moghraidhjamie, the person responsible for more
craziness from me this Christmas.PreviouslyScotia (III)“Ride North,” Maisri
Wise-Eyes had said, her voice filled with the clarity of prophecy. “Until ye
find the tree broken by the roar of thunder. There springs the river with no
end. Follow it where it leads.”“This must be it.” Jamie looked around, adjusting
the hood of his cloak, sheltering himself against the coming of night’s frosty kiss.
“I was here two moons ago, hunting, and this tree was standing straight – it must
have been stricken by lightning since then.”“Aye.” Murtagh nodded, blowing against his
palms to warm himself. “This far north the air is freezing like Xaphan’s own toenails. Maisri better be
right, or I’ll throttle the bloody seer.”They had been riding hard for the last couple
of weeks, barely giving time for man or beast to gather strength – a powerful
urgency had taken over Jamie, a fever burning steadily, brought on by the
knowledge of darkness lurking. His sleep was agitated, filled with dreams he
couldn’t recall after the sun had risen, and the deep dark circles around his
eyes spoke of the burden consuming him. He had accepted Scotia’s crown and in his
scabbard now slept her sword, its hilt engraved with runes which told the story
of the birth of light. Following his strange conversation with Maisri – if her
riddles and premonitions could actually be called a conversation -, Jamie had squinted through dozens of old tomes in
the archives, searching for any mention of An
Lia Fàil. The name sounded strangely familiar, annoying in the constant
sensation that he should remember it clearly – as if he had heard of it a long
time ago, when his years were yet too young to recount the tale. The knowledge
of the old days – specially the ones right after the end of darkness - was
scattered, passed along by imperfect human tongue; very few dedicated enough of
their time to committing the relevant events of their lives to written word –
much had been forgotten and, undoubtedly, distorted by the rushing of years.“Shouldn’t the keeper of the furnaces of hell
preserve his toenails warm, like the rest of him?” Jamie gave his godfather a lopsided
smile, amused with the ramblings of his fiercely protective mentor. “No one cares for toenails.” Murtagh shrugged,
distractedly patting the powerful flank of his horse. “But I dinna see a river
with no end – no river whatsoever, for that matter.” They both looked around,
as if expecting to suddenly catch sight of a mass of moving water.“We’ll have to look in the forest around this
place.” Jamie suggested, sounding resigned. “We’ll do it first thing in the
morning, aye?”“When ye find this An Lia Fàil,” The older man said, careful to pronounce it correctly
– for names held power and could summon unseen things. “What are ye supposed to
do with it?”“I dinna ken.” Jamie admitted, starting to
collect branches to build a small open fire. “Maisri dinna have much to say
about it. Only that the dragonfly mark is somehow linked to it.”The silver doe with
honey-eyes runs to meet the dragonfly. Jamie hadn’t told his guardian about that
particular bit of the seer’s predictions – for some unforeseeable reason, the
silver doe seemed like a private matter, something precious which would lose
its power by being shared with another’s ears. They ate with parsimony from their provisions,
talking idly over the soft roar of the fire, until they were lulled by the
sound of green branches crackling, so fiercely loved by the hot flames they
couldn’t avoid being turned into ash.  When Jamie opened his eyes, running away from
the arms of sleep as if someone had whispered his name against his resting ear,
a doe – her fur silver as a moonbeam, her eyes the color of fragrant honey –
was standing over him. He waited, motionless, as she – for there was
no doubt in his mind that this creature could be anything but a female –
inspected him, sniffing softly to taste his scent, not yet aware of his wakefulness.
Irrationally attracted by the shimmer that seemed to irradiate from her, Jamie
raised his trembling fingers and touched her neck.She squeaked, a sound utterly human, and a mighty thunder boomed above.
A cloud of mist surrounded her – coming over the clearing like a swift blow on
a candle - and, within the time that took Jamie to blink his eyes, she had
transformed into the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. “How dare you touching me, mortal?” The shapeshifter
woman roared, and the skies wept with her rage.

                            Fanfiction - A Lifetime of Her (Part III)
                            Part III – “You don’t know how lovely you are”Twenty-fourThe night was unusually dark, even for the end
of September – the scarce light of public illumination swallowed by scraps of
mist, like cold long fingers, stretching to capture an unwary victim. But the
lack of visible stars caused me more dismay – the feeling of infinity I usually
felt gazing above my head, of endless life beyond the flapping of butterflies’
wings of human existence, veiled beyond my reach. I felt small and locked
outside of a mystery that made my life more meaningful. I was walking fast across Princes Street, my hands buried on the pockets of my overcoat,
thinking about the job interview I had endured that day – a promising position
as a Math teacher for a local high school, very surprising considering my lack
of experience and the fact that I was fresh out of college. The headmistress
had seemed pleasant and competent, interested in knowing things about my
personal life as well as my academic course – inevitably she had asked why I
had took almost an entire year off school, four years ago. I had answered truthfully,
reassuring her about my full recovery. To my right I could see the Gardens and the
outline of the Scottish National Gallery,
one of my favourite places in Edinburgh to relax and spend some free time.
Without a second thought, I decided to make a shortcut across the park, which
would lead me straight to the neighbourhood where I had rented a small, yet cosy,
apartment. I saw her before I could even hear her – she was
standing alone, talking on the phone, close to the museum entrance. She was
wearing a long black dress with sleeves, which fitted perfectly her mesmerizing
body, kissing her curves with fabric lips – her hair pinned up in a simple but
elegant knot. She sounded distressed and – I thought – angry enough to make me
want to run in the other direction. I recognized her instantly, even in such
different circumstances than those of our last encounter – Claire.I walked – levitated, really – towards her,
without any notion of why I was doing it. Perhaps I meant to thank her for what
she had done in the past. Maybe I was fascinated by the idea that, for once, I
could be her saviour. She was clearly dressed for an elegant party – as I
approached the building, I noticed several people in similar clothing, probably
heading for some sort of gala inside. I could hear her talking more clearly, her
voice quick and deadly, like the stab of a dagger. “Fine!” She snapped, suddenly finishing her conversation. Claire
looked at her phone with aversion, like she was considering the idea of throwing
it to the nearby bushes.I was near enough for her to notice my presence
– without recognizing me, she quickly composed her expression and looked at her
phone with pretended interest, fearing any unwanted advances from a strange man
in the night. “Claire?” I called her, as I reached the circle
of light streamed through the museum’s doors. Her eyes jumped to mine and softened,
as she promptly identified me. “Jamie!” She greeted me, smiling – her lips
were a soft pink with the touch of discrete lipstick. “How are you?”“Good.” I grinned back – a gesture that almost
entirely faded away as I noticed the ring on her finger. It was a sizable
diamond, shining like a beacon made of crystal, outrageously dominant on her
slender finger. An engagement ring.  “I couldna resist, coming to say hello.”“It’s so good to see you!” Claire seemed
honestly happy and warm – a million miles away from the cold glacier of moments
before. “Are you coming to the charity gala too?”“Ach, nae.” I gave her a lopsided smile and
raised my brow. “Is that why ye’re here?”“Yes.” She shrugged, sliding her phone inside
her black satin clutch. “I was waiting for my fiancé but it seems he is…rather busy at the moment. He won’t be
coming.”“I’m sorry to hear that.” I said softly, trying
to abstract myself of how magnificent she looked – dark as the night, but with
millions of stars inside her. “I’m sure ye’ll have a lovely time, nonetheless.”“I doubt that.” She replied, somewhat
conspiratorially. “This night was organized by a friend of my uncle – he was
kind enough to invite me in honour of his memory. Actually, I don’t know a
living soul inside those doors.” Claire’s eyes darkened, sadness creeping in. “Maybe
I’ll just go home and send him my apologies afterwards.”“No!” I instantly rejected the idea. “Perhaps I
could go with ye?” I suggested in a cool tone, praying that I wasn’t about to
blush. I pointed to my black attire, matched with a grey tie. “I’m wearing a
suit after all.”“That you are.” She smiled, with a hint of
mischief in her eyes. “Do you really don’t mind?” Claire asked, nervously
adjusting a stubborn curl that had fled her hairdo. “We could just pretend you’re
my fiancé. No one really knows Frank, either way.”“Of course, lass.” I mockingly offered her my
arm for her to hold. “Shall we?”We entered the party, quickly mingling with the
crowd – an assorted array of wealthy men and women, with a taste for art and philanthropy
- or for ostentation. Soon enough we had located the canapé and champagne flutes, launching ourselves in a conversation
about the artistry on display – or lack of it. “So, are you fully recovered?” Claire eventually
asked me over the live jazz music, that a small band was playing in the corner,
a saxophone crying about the loss of an imperfect lover. “Aye.” I nodded, offering her one of my owlish
winks. “I’m so verra thankful for what ye did for me – I…”“Don’t be silly!” She dismissed emphatically,
waving her hand. “I should be the one to thank you!” And seeing my puzzled
look, she leaned over and talked closer to my ear. “After what you told me, I
went ahead and applied to medical school. I work some shifts as a nurse to pay
my bills, but I’m a proud med student!”“That is wonderful!” I congratulated her,
squeezing her hand – soft and capable, warm under my fingers as a pulsing
heart. “I’m so glad!”I convinced her to dance, afterwards. She
conceded with an amused smile. We swayed together, amongst other couples – I
wasn’t an eager dancer and had no memory of a time when the idea of dancing had
seemed appealing to me. But with Claire everything was natural and effortless –
every move and word had the magical quality of destiny, of a life finally fulfilled.
I tried very hard to overlook the shackles symbolized by her ring, the
deafening warning of a tragedy I was powerless to avoid. She had wilfully surrender
to the dragon – I couldn’t be her saving knight.“So what happened to yer fiancé?” I asked tentatively,
my hand struggling not to caress her lower back. God, it seemed so easy to touch her, to hold her against me. “Ye
seemed distraught.”“He had a meeting with another faculty
assistant.” She pursed her lips in discontent, her eyes avoiding his – hiding her
pain and shame. “Something about a spectacular discovery in his newest
research.”“Oh.” I babbled, trying to sound charitable. “Have
ye been engaged for a long time?”“A couple of months.” Claire sighed, her
fingers accidentally brushing the back of my neck and making me shiver,
preparing to confess her secrets under the protection of the music around us. “Actually,
he has been invited to go to America to teach – and asked me to go with him.”“And will ye?” I asked, almost breathless –
pushing down the sudden feeling of panic, like a dark wave that threatened to
swallow the skyscrapers of my soul. “Go with him?”“I honestly don’t know.” She admitted slowly,
wincing a little. “But I accepted his proposal so…I should want to go with him,
shouldn’t I?”“I dinna ken much about serious relationships.”
I said in a hoarse voice. “But I dinna understand how a man can leave a woman
like ye, alone, in such a night. I dinna ken how anything can be more important
than being with ye.”“It’s complicated!” She tried to argue, but her
voice lacked the vigour of certainty. “He has to work a lot to get recognized. Sometimes
he has to let go of superfluous things, as much as I –““Dinna say that!” My voice was a deep rumble, suddenly
stripped of all civility. “Ye should be the priority in his life, lass. Ye are a
wonderful woman.” I gulped. “Any man deserving of being with ye, should give ye
the place ye deserve in his life. Never settle for less, Claire.”She nodded, looking away to hide the sudden
threat of tears. Eventually, her body relaxed and her cheek came to rest in the
lapel of my blazer, silently thanking me for my support. I could feel the small
movements of her lashes, the hot breath of her life so close to my heart – I never
felt more alive, nor more defeated. We talked and danced the night away – I made
her twirl and laugh, until her face was less pale, more like the lively girl in
the graveyard, so alive amongst my ghosts. At the end of the night, I escorted her to a
taxi – not daring to offer her my company to her doorway. I feared what the
intoxicating mixture of her and the champagne might conjure up. She smiled – skilfully tucking something inside
the pocket of my overcoat – and stood on her toes to kiss my cheek in a tender
goodbye. Later, feeling less overwhelmed by the lack of stars, I read her note –
“In case you need it. XO”. She had
added a phone number underneath the short sentence and a funny smiley face,
with abundant curly hair. I kept her note under my pillow for the next
few weeks – a silent dare, urging me to take a leap of faith. I was convinced
that my path was fundamentally entwined with Claire’s – it had to be a reason
for the insistency of life to place her in my way. She lured me in – fascinated
me. I must have grabbed the phone, adamant on
calling her, half a dozen times. Started to dial her phone number – by then
carved on my brain with luminescent red ink of desire – at least a dozen more. I
mentally prepared our conversation – tried different variations of casualness,
honesty and tenderness. I laid awake at night, gazing at the phone, ominous and
teasing. “Iffrin!”
I desperately reprehended myself one night, almost a month after the gala. I
clenched my teeth, breathed deeply several times, and made the call – prepared to
invite her for innocent coffee.“The number you are
trying to reach has been disconnected or is no longer in service.” – said the mechanical and metallic voice
that took me back to a place with no stars.

                            I must be mad because – yes! – this is Part III.
As promised, this is a short story, so we’re almost at the end. Thank you so
much for the overwhelming support and lovely words – I cherish each and every
one of them in my heart. You guys rock! See you on the other side. &lt;3All my fanfictionPart III – Dresses &amp;
Question MarksThe weeks went by quickly, as I watched the
days pass submerged on a numbed haze. I dove on my work, finding solace on the
bleeding vessels that I could repair; on the firm grip of the sternal saw on my
fingers - lethal on an unexperienced hand – but a doorway to the pulsing heart
that I could hold on my hands and actually cure; on the buzzing of the machines
that surrounded me in the OR, as soothing to my troubled soul as a lullaby. I tried my hardest to avoid Jamie. I had so
much to tell him – and yet I feared the unavoidable change that conversation
would entail. Since that night on the phone, I had come to a halting conclusion
– if Jamie actually married Geneva, I must find a way to sever all ties with
him. I couldn’t contaminate him with my misery; couldn’t condemn his marriage
to a blustering failure by splitting him in two. But I still held hope that I could sway things.
So on Friday morning, having the day off from work, I allowed myself a double
expresso - with no sugar or cream – and raided my closet for something to wear.
There’s no rationalizing it, really – I wasn’t going on a date. But if I intended
to fight a battle, I needed an armour – I couldn’t feel inferior to Geneva,
defeated before I had the chance to brandish my proverbial sword. I settled for
high waisted trousers, with an elegant cut, and a white chemise, complemented
with black heels – quite unusual for my practical nature.She had texted me the address the previous
night, so I met her in front of the first shop she intended to explore, a pricy
and tasteful establishment called “The
Blushing Bride”. Geneva was wearing a floral blue dress and sunglasses,
which - to my profound distaste - made her look like a movie star. “Claire!” She greeted me with a pleasant smile.
“So glad you made it!”“Yes.” I tried to smile back, but my facial
muscles felt stiff. “I wouldn’t miss it for the world.” Geneva patted me on the
shoulder, as if she was a pet owner, proud of her small animal’s behaviour.“Shall we go in?” She theatrically peeked above
the rim of her glasses, her grey eyes shining. Seeing me nodding in agreement,
she marched to the boutique’s door. “What do you have in mind?” I asked, almost
blinded by the sudden outburst of white, ivory and cream that filled my eyes
the moment I stepped inside.“Well, I wanted to talk to you about the
wedding.” She tapped her finger on her lips. “Make sure you’re on board.”“I was talking about the wedding dress.” I
whispered, raising my eyebrows. “Unless you want to go wild and wear a red
number or spend the rest of our days inside this store, I think we need to
narrow it down a bit.”“And you?” Geneva asked, her chestnut hair
dangling around her shoulders, as she moved to touch on some fabrics. “Did you
decide already what you’re wearing? With your voluptuous curves, you need to be
somewhat careful.”I was pretty sure she was trying to imply that
my arse was big – but I was very distant from the insecure teenager I might
have been while at high school. I was well resolved with the curves of my butt –
and happened to know that Jamie found it one of my best traits. “Not sure yet,” I replied evenly, offering her
one relaxed smile. “But I’m thinking black.”“Oh.” She said. If she grasped it for the
offense it was intended to be, she said nothing. We moved around the racks of
imposing dresses, trading short comments about shapes and colours. “Jamie has
been…very… gentlemanly with me.” She
said haltingly. I bit the inside of my cheek. “I’m that fortunate, of course.
But I was thinking if he ever said anything to you? There’s nothing wrong with
him – medically, of course?”I hummed, silently grateful for not being
eating salty snacks this time around. “I think Jamie is just different from
other men.” I coughed, fixing my gaze on some shoes, embellished with sequins
and ribbons. “He wants to do right by you. I’m sure he’ll give you an
unforgettable honeymoon, though.”I had shared a bed with Jamie through the
years, for various reasons – holidays, sleepovers or while I tended him when he
was sick. And although we had never ventured on that type of intimacy, I hadn’t
failed to notice his arousal when he woke up next to me in bed. I was fairly
certain everything worked properly –
should he choose to take that step. Fortunately my assurances seemed to have
soothed her anxieties – I couldn’t stomach to know more about their sexual dalliances.
Eventually, Geneva decided it was time to start to try on some wedding dresses.The first gown was pearl pink and had a train
that should be reserved to royalty only. The second one had a skirt so big it
could fit an entire family of five inside it – if she was planning to live
under it, not only be married in it, it could have been a good choice. The
third model seemed to belong on the Moulin
Rouge – not for being ostentatious or glittery, but because it resembled
naughty lingerie.I was partially amused with Geneva’s choices –
but dismay was slowly creeping in. How was it possible that this woman knew so
little of the man she was about to be married? How was it possible that Jamie
was about to commit himself to this shallow girl, so focused on her desires
that she completely overlooked his own?“I don’t think that’s the one.” I said shortly,
trying to contain laughter, as Geneva displayed attempt number four - she
actually had tried a red dress. “Perhaps
something more classic and simple – let your beauty shine for itself.”Geneva looked at me through the mirror on the
wall, a small smile appearing on her lips. “I know you don’t like me much,
Claire. That’s alright – we are very
different, you and I. And you had such a special
place in Jamie’s life…I really wasn’t expecting it to be any different.” Her
chestnut hair was blazing on the artificial lights and for once she seemed
solemn and serious, her eyes searching mine on the reflected image. “But I want
you to know that I do love him – fiercely. I want him to be happy.”I inhaled slowly, my hands closing until I
could feel my nails digging on my flesh. I returned her gaze and gave her a
small nod. “Good. We want the same thing, then.” I got up
from the armchair where I had been surveilling her pageant and walked to a
hanger nearby. I searched through an array of dresses, until I found the one. “Here,
try this on.”She was right – I didn’t like her. Not only
because she was stealing away Jamie, but also because we were as diametrically
different as the sun and the moon. We weren’t really best friend material,
either – and for that alone I could participate in ridicule her, watching her
choose the worst dress in the entire collection.  But she was a woman in love – and I could
relate to that. And she was marrying a man that deserved the absolute best –
even if I could ruin her day (and I wasn’t that sure I actually had it in me),
I couldn’t take any part in hurting Jamie.  “It’s perfect. Isn’t it?” She asked moments
later, almost breathless. Her eyes were moist with emotion – she seemed
vulnerable, not so poised and coquettish, and for a moment I could see the
woman Jamie had decided to cherish. “Yes.” I whispered, my voice hoarse. “My job
here is done.”****Do you know how time has that magical capacity
of changing its pace? How he races when something dreadful approaches and
stretches, languid, when your deepest desires are almost within your grasp?I didn’t know where I had lost the weeks that
acted as shields to Jamie’s wedding. One sleepless night here; one long surgery
there; a weekend away at Callandar to take my mind of things. Several missed
calls from Jamie and even more missed words between us. One day I woke up and only one week was left;
and Jamie had texted me at dawn summoning me to go to the pub that night, hang
out with the happy couple and the lads as a kind of stag party. “Tonight is the night, darling.” I patted Adso
and rubbed his ear. “Make the cut and assess the bleeding – find out if it’s
catastrophic or if the patient lives to fight another day.”****“Ye’re very quiet tonight, Sassenach.” Jamie
asked me discretely, while everyone was busy requesting another round. “Are ye
concerned for a patient?”“Yes.” I gratefully used the offered escape. “A
serious heart problem, poor thing. Don’t think she’s going to make it.”“Ah.” His eyes wrinkled with seriousness. “I’m
verra sorry to hear that.”“We changed the honeymoon.” Geneva was chatting
with Willie and Angus. “Instead of going to Bermuda, we’re staying at a lovely
cottage in Isle of Skye.”“Aye.” Jamie smiled. “Geneva surprised me. She
thought I would like to spend my honeymoon in Scotland and Skye is such a bonny
place.”“Did she?” I babbled, drinking down my whiskey.
“How about yer vows, Jamie lad?” Rupert asked. “Are
you finished writing them?”“Actually,” Geneva interrupted. “I insisted
that we used the ancient Gaelic vows. Since we won’t be married at Lallybroch,
I want Jamie to have a bit of Scotland with him.”I snorted so loudly that every face on the
booth was turned in my direction. “What’s going on, Sassenach?” Jamie asked,
leaning to whisper on my ear. “Nothing.” I croaked. “I have something in my
nose. Must be some sort of virus.”“Ye look healthy enough to me.” Jamie grimaced.
“You seem to be missing lots of things.” I
replied, dryly. “Obviously.” I mouthed, before I raised my glass again. “Are ye making me an uncle anytime soon, Jamie?”
Willie laughed. “Flora could do with having another bairn to play when we
gather.”“We want plenty of children.” Geneva smiled and
looked adoringly at Jamie, squeezing his hand placed on the table. “Jamie
always wanted a big family.”This time my laugh was evident – a sardonic and
humourless sound, which sounded cruel even to my ears. Geneva was frowning in
my direction and Jamie’s eyes were piercing mine. Angus looked at me with apprehension,
before he dexterously grabbed Geneva and dragged her to play some darts.“Why are you being like this?” Jamie asked when
we were left alone, sat together on the booth, as we had been countless times
before. “Like what?” I asked defiantly. “Mallaichte
bas! Like a wee bairn with a bad temper, Claire.” Jamie growled. “Ye’ve
been cruel to Geneva tonight, and unrightfully so. She is only trying to please
me.”“She is only saying what you want to hear. And
if you think anything different, you’re the fool!” I spat out, my cheeks
flushing. I had a whistling sound inside my ears that seemed to throb in rhythm
with my heart. “Are ye jealous?” Jamie said slowly. “Because
finally someone knows me other than you?”“Lake District doll doesn’t know the first
thing about you!” I hissed, leaning over the table as a cat about to pounce. “All
these things – the honeymoon, the vows, the children – I told her all of that. She
is only repeating it, because she was afraid you would realize how this whole
marriage is a damned farce. I even chose her fucking wedding dress! I’m the one
that knows you, Jamie – not her.”“And yet I’m marrying her.” Jamie swallowed
hard. “Ye said ye would support me and instead you’re entertaining yerself with
the wreckage of my life!”“You bloody bastard!” I sobbed. Tears were
burning my eyes, as the dim lights of the pub turned to washing rivers. “I can’t
sleep, eat or think and yet – yet you think I’m entertained!”“If you’re not entertained, then what are ye?”
Jamie clenched his jaw, as an invisible dome of anger and frustration
surrounded him. “I think you know.” I began to gather my things
– phone, scarf and purse – preparing to leave. “Perhaps you knew all along. That’s
why you let yourself enter this scheme of an engagement. That’s why you chose
for a fiancé someone that couldn’t really know you or see you.”“Seas!”
Jamie said, his voice low. “Please, Claire. I need ye by my side.”“No.” I closed my eyes – catastrophic bleeding,
then. “I won’t. I’m sorry, but I can’t be your best woman. I can’t be at your
wedding, Jamie.” I opened my eyes and looked at him, preparing to turn my back
on him for what could be the last time. “It’s me you call in the middle of the
night. It’s my body you crave for when you come out of sleep. It’s my voice you
want to hear first when something happens – to share the burden or the
happiness. I’m the one that knows your dreams, nightmares and desires. So what
does that mean, Jamie?” He looked at me with confusion and pain in his
blue, daunting, eyes. He opened his lips – God,
would I never kiss him there? – but I raised my hand to stop him. “I think you should do some soul searching,
James Fraser. Call me when you realize that you have loved me all along.” And I
walked away.
