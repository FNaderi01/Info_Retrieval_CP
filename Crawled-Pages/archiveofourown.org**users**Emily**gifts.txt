    Summary
      "Sa maison a trop de fenêtres.Rita était une proie facile. Elle vivait selon des rituels millimétrés, comme on obéit à un culte. Elle allait, tranquille, toujours aux mêmes heures du jour. Cartographier sa vie avait été aisé : son monde se limitait à un cadre étroit qu’on pouvait sans peine crever. Elle n’éteignait jamais la lumière, comme une gamine apeurée par le noir. Les fenêtres éclaboussaient les pins voisins, dessinaient un nouvel horizon à cette plaine vide. Rita vivait dans une maison isolée de tout.Et, cette nuit, il a bien l'intention de s'y introduire."Inspired by My Favorite Murder, the podcast.

    Summary
      Amami nodded and noticed Takami's eyes were heavy with a lack of sleep, and his teeth were clenching periodically with every fit of stress that hit him. It was obvious that the brunette was taking the repetitive defeats against Tokuchi harder than anyone else on the team, and Amami knew better than anyone that Itsuki was infamous for overworking himself. Amami also knew that people like Takami often pushed themselves past the breaking point and ended up hurting themselves due to overworking. So, to keep Takami from killing himself on accident, Amami often became the outlet of his stress every once in a while.

      "It sounds like you're saying you always win." You commented. Joel didn't respond, instead he raised a hand to your chin and tilted it up slowly until your eyes were resting on the pile of bills at the center of the felt-covered poker table."Oh baby," He murmured into the crook of your neck, sucking a mark and gently blowing across the sensitive spot, "I do."

You responded, trying to maintain your cool. You had never been this close to him without homework involved."Why would you do a thing like that?" He asked, his hand slowly sliding up your thigh to your shorts.You licked your lips and raised your eyes to meet his dark brown ones, "Because I didn't think it would be appropriate for someone to walk in on you fucking me over your desk."

    Summary
      Dear Harry,You were so forgiving when I left. The look on your face- you were so hurt, but eventually you smiled down at me and pulled me into a hug. While you probably did so in an effort to prevent me from seeing you cry, my t-shirt is still damp from the tears that you left. No doubt the floral shirt you wore that day is equally so, despite my rule to never cry in front of others. You were always the exception though, I guess.By the time you read this, it will have been nearly a year since we last saw each other. That prospect is the most frightening I’ve ever had to face, but I have to believe that in that time you’ve come to appreciate why I did what I did and maybe one day you’ll hate me a little less for it. Always in my heart,Yours Sincerely,Louis.
