    Creator Chose Not To Use Archive Warningshinted Yancy Becket/Mako Mori hinted Raleigh Becket/Chuck HansenMako Mori Yancy Becket Chuck Hansen Raleigh Becket Max the bulldog Herc HansenFluff Angst like fuck if I know where this came from seriously I Don't Even Know AU I had too much fun fucking with canon cursing if the prior tags didn't clue you in on that
    Summary
      AU in which the Beckets have been transferred to Sydney along with Mako.Chapter One: Chuck is not happy about this.Until he maybe sorta kinda is.Because he hasn't really had friends...especially not friends like these three.(This is not a foursome fic. There is no sex. I cannot write smut so there will never be sex.)Chapter Two:Raleigh's turn. It's close the anniversary of the Knifehead incident, Max hates him and Chuck seems captivated by this new tech.He is not having a good time.Luckily, Yancy, Mako and even Herc know what he seems oblivious to.
