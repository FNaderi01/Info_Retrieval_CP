You are not messing around with this one!” “What an amazing story and ridiculously good last chapter, DopeScotlandWarrior. Usually when I read “The End” I’m so sad, but while I’d love more, you’ve spun a tale that we’ve thoroughly enjoyed. You took it so many directions that I stopped guessing and went along for the ride (a racing pun?). I’ll read anything you write, thank you so very much!”

When Jamie and Lord John decided that blending their families would be the safest place for all of them, Jamie hadn’t counted on the feelings that his constant, close proximity to Grey would bring to the surface. Now Jamie can’t take the wanting anymore, but he’s still madly in love with Claire. Something’s got to give.

Changing into blue scrubs, I pulled my unruly curls into submission with a hair tie, slipped my trainers on and my white lab coat, and was out the door in no time, eager for work.This was what Frank would never understand: the thrill of correct diagnoses, the rush of saving lives, the gratitude in a patient’s eyes. Not staying at home, being a perfect Stepford wife, attending and hosting his dinner parties, like he clearly wanted.Our marriage had lost its luster; it felt like it was now covered by a thin veneer of civility, and that getting thinner by the day. I sighed – perhaps some time away together, a holiday, a second honeymoon, might help regain lost territory.Or marriage counseling. The fact that I was relieved about having a shift where I didn’t have to go home for another 36 hours was telling; the relief was balanced out in equal shares with guilt.After a simple scheduled tonsillectomy, the day flew by attending other cases, none of them very serious. When we hit a lull at one in the morning, I checked in at the nurses’ station with Mrs. Duncan, the head of staff.“I think I’m off for a rest, Mrs. Duncan, I’ll be in the on-call room if I’m needed.”“That’s alright, dearie. Mary’s doing a few rounds as well. Take a nap.” She waved me off with a smile.I took off my trainers and white coat. Sliding onto one of the cots provided for doctors and interns working all-nighters, I pulled a thin hospital-issue blanket over me and was asleep in seconds.And the red-haired man was there.I had had my share of recurring dreams in my life; the typical school dreams, flying, and recurring nightmares featuring dinosaurs for some odd reason.But him – this was different from other dreams. I was standing in the middle of a bookshop, next to a tall, broad-shouldered man dressed in a simple jeans and a grey shirt. Muted streetlight filtered through the display windows, as he bent down and used a box cutter to slice through a taped package. I looked around. This setting was new. I couldn’t go anywhere in these dreams, it seemed, except wherever the man went. Before, I’d accompanied him on early-morning runs through cobbled streets, watched him sip coffee at a kitchen table, and seen him contemplate sunrise on a lush, hilly farm that minded me of Ireland or Scotland. The bright mop of coppery cinnamon hair made him Celtic at least.I glanced down and saw he was unpacking books from the box. I wondered if he worked here or owned the shop. I leaned around him and took a good look at the box. The shipping label for the recipient read D’un Monde A L’autre – Booksellers. Glasgow.The books he was stacking on a counter were new Ken Folletts. I’d been dying to read the latest release, but didn’t know if I’d have time, between the hospital and catering to Frank’s social demands. I followed him behind the counter while he proceeded to scan the barcode on all the books. I observed his hands, competent and strong, handle box after box. The serenity in his striking blue eyes, the love and respect all the books in the shop seemed to command.I’d lost track of time – but then you always do, in dream worlds. Several boxes later, there was a brief tap at the glass door. A blonde woman stood there, waving at the man. I’d never managed to catch his name, if he had one.“Hey.” The blonde woman gave him a quick peck on the lips as she walked in. “Pub’s finally closed. Ready to go?” I noticed her attire and deduced she worked as a server. Her name tag read Laoghaire. Lah-ogh… leg-hair? A strange name to dream of.“In a minute.” His voice, which I had never heard before, sent a quiver of reconnaissance through me. Deep, self-assured, calm, like warm honey on cake.It took more than a minute – more like fifteen. She stood by, tapping her foot impatiently while she waited, but never once offered to help. He finished stocking the new books, shut down the computer, and flicked off the lights in the shop. It went dark, but I couldn’t follow. I stood rooted to the bookshop floor and watched them walk away until they turned a corner.I woke up, wishing it were a world where he was real.
