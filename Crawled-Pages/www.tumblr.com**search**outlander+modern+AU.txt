            House of Fraser, Chpt 9 - Tippy Toes        “Oh bloody hell!” Claire stood on her tip toes reaching for a box at the top of her closet. Her middle finger finally found purchase and she grabbed the falling box before it hit her in the face. She upturned the contents onto her bed. It was lingerie. The lingerie she’d bought for her honeymoon. When she purchased it, she was half convinced she’d end up returning it. She and Frank had never been adventurous in the bedroom. Claire was open to exploration, but the one time she suggested role play, he thought it childish and untoward. And she did fake her release more often than not. Even so, she liked sex with him. It just wasn’t worth the hassle of stressing him out when she was generally satisfied with it and she could handle the matter on her own later.  She took a deep breath and placed her hands on her hips; her skin still moist from the shower. She stared at the bra’s sheer black mesh and red straps. It was accompanied by a red thong and garters. The red bottomed stilettos were safely hidden underneath her bed. Yesterday, after leaving Helwater, she’d gone to her flat and downed half a bottle of Rioja and fell asleep on her sofa watching a sappy Netflix romcom.  It was ‘false intimacy’ she told herself. Completely situational. No different than the attraction a patient felt for a therapist or a student for a professor.  It was normal.  Keep reading

On Borrowed TimeJamie/Claire Modern AU:The story of Claire Beauchamp, a feminist studies scholar and J.A.M.M Fraser, a playwright, spanning over a period of ten years between Cambridge, MA and Edinburgh, Scotland.As always, my gratitude goes to @notevenjokingfic for taking the time to provide invaluable suggestions.There shouldn’t be a formating issue on desktop but it is wonky with tumblr on mobile. I am obsessed with formatting because it is part of the storytelling. TeaserPrologue———————— Chapter 1 Edinburgh, Scotland 7 years agoScotland. Alba. The earthly dwelling of Gods. Of visible and tangible divinity.Legends, superstitions, and folklore. Sìthichean. Buidsichean. Kelpie. Brollachan. Selkie. Lusting. Roaming. Searching. Waiting. Betwixt worlds, neither here, nor there.Beanntan. Lochan. Tràighean. Glinn. Aibhnichean. Alba’s majestic landscape. Transporting souls into a spiritual realm. Loosening tongues into poetry. Healing. Ritualizing. Transforming. Rebirthing of the self.The past is intricately woven into the present, written into every brick and stone, a reminder that we live in the memory of history, reconstituting history as we encounter the present. If Scotland is magical, Edinburgh, with its classic architecture, narrow streets, hidden church yards, and passageways, is as romantic as it is adventurous. It is a city that sparks the imagination, emboldens the spirit, and dares the lonely heart to love.It is in this city that I, Claire Beauchamp, a British scholar, met J.A.M.M Fraser, the beloved playwright of modern Scotland. It is only fitting that Edinburgh—known since the 18th century as a “City of Letters” and synonymous with Arthur Conan Doyle, Robert Burns, Walter Scott, Muriel Spark, Naomi Mitchison, and JK Rowling—bears witness to the meeting of souls, a chance encounter that irrevocably changed the course of two lives.Jamie.  Jamie Fraser.  James Alexander Malcolm Mackenzie Fraser.The playwright. Correction. The beloved playwright of Scotland.  Edinburgh’s son. Local-boy-made-good.  After a decade of experiences in global theater scenes—New York, Toronto, Tokyo, Athens, Melbourne, Buenos Aires and Subotica—Jamie returned to Edinburgh, established his own theatrical production company (becoming a playwright-producer in the process), procured a space in an abandoned historical building, and dedicated his life to breathing new vision into the arts and culture of his hometown.He was beautiful and graceful.  Over six feet tall. Broad in proportion. Shoulder length curly reddish mane, a riot of blazing autumnal colors come alive.   Slanted blue eyes. Generous wide mouth. High cheekbones. Courtesy of his Viking forefathers.  Assertive, but without the arrogance of his species.  Perceptive, but without the liability that renders him a threat to masculine ethos.  This is a man who knows his worth.The body of a warrior.  The mind of an intellectual.  The upbringing of a gentleman.  The soul of a barbarian.He is still in me.My warrior.  My intellectual.  My gentleman.  My barbarian.  Mine.Was he ever?Will the haunting never cease?The familiarity.  Captivating. Spellbinding. Ethereal.  Of knowing someone.  Of recognizing someone.  Such a recognition, of being in the know, made words superfluous.Disquieting me. Disquieting him.  Disquieting us.  We who weave words for a living.A practical academic, I do not believe in fate, soulmates, and forever.  Words absent from my existence. Untested meaning-making. He breathed life into them.  He upended the core of my being.  The scaffolding that upholds Claire Beauchamp.The familiarity disassembles me.The familiarity.  A warning.  I flouted it. I rendered my heart vulnerable.  And my heart betrayed me.He is still in me.Chapter 2

            La Retour de Foi Chapter 1        Summary: Nothing is ever lost, only changed.Its been 27 years since Claire and Jamie’s daughter was put up for adoption, and their family has never felt truly whole since. At least they have the Fraser Family Reunion at Lallybroch to look forward to. Claire sends an email, Young Ian crashes a car, and a familiar stranger walks the streets of Broch Mordha. Faith lives modern au in Scotland.A/N: And now for something completely different. Had a bug, wouldn’t go away. And the rest is history. I have no idea if anyone actually wants to read this. But when has anyone actually read anything I’ve written? Anywhere, here you go. From my brain to yours. [EDIT] The title of the work has been changed in order to be more grammatically correctPrologue Dear Mrs. McTavish…Claire’s fingers hovered over the keys, shaking with agitation and nerves. The easy part was done with, at least, as well as most of the hard part, she’d like to think. How long had she been waiting for this moment? Since yesterday when she got the confirmation email but was too busy (not nervous, absolutely not nervous) to adequately draft this message? Six months when she first called the adoption agency? A year when the idea first popped into her head. 27 years, three months, and 14 days. She shook her head. Best not dwell too long on that. Blinking back tears, she started the next line-I am a Doctor in a town called Broch Mordha-She repeatedly tapped the backspace key while shaking her head. That made her sound like she was conducting some sort of experiment or clinical trial. She couldn’t think of a better way for her message to be immediately deleted. I lost my daughter-Backspace, backspace, backspace. Too strong, much too strong. There had to be some sort of middle ground between sounding like a bureaucratic robot and Emily Bronte. She took a deep breath and started one more time.27 years ago, you adopted a young girl in Scotland-…Chapter 1 Keep reading

            House of Fraser, Chpt 8 - Vegan Chocolate Date Balls        Claire dashed into the front office of Jamie’s studio. The skies had unleashed a monsoon and she was standing in front of John’s desk, creating a puddle of waterwitch proportions. “Dr. Beauchamp, we weren’t expecting you for another half hour.” John Grey shot up to help her with the odd assortment of food tins she was carrying.  “I’ll get you a towel and tell Jamie you’re here.” He raced down the hall.   Keep reading

Deepest gratitude to @lcbeauchampoftarth for her amazing energy and mad beta skills, and to @notevenjokingfic for giving this chapter some love. Previous chapterChapter 8Edinburgh7 years ago—Scars.Injury and trauma of spectacular violence.Fibrous tissues intricately weaving themselves in the healing process.Physical. Psychological.

House of Fraser, Chpt 2, An Unpolished Diamond“He’s here, but the fiancée is running late,” John Grey stated as he poked his head into Jamie’s office. “Ah, ok, I’ll go back to the studio until she arrives,” Jamie replied.“No, Randall said he wanted to start. I’ll show her back when she gets here.”“Oh.” Jamie pulled off his glasses, grabbed his sketchbook and Randall’s proposal. He brushed his hair behind his ear. He wore his hair slightly long; the deep red locks curling slightly at his nape. Jamie usually wore old jeans and T shirts around the studio, but for the Randall meeting he chose a pair of fitted gray trousers, a crisp pale blue Oxford shirt, his Fraser tartan socks, and brown leather lace up boots. Jamie followed John into the conference room where Frank Randall awaited. “Mr. Randall,” Jamie smiled as he extended his hand.“Mr. Fraser, good afternoon.” Randall’s handshake was firm. Jamie observed his wardrobe was that of a man 15 years older than his apparent age. Jamie motioned for him to sit. Randall wasted no time, “Mr Fraser, this wedding is very important for me, my fiancée, and my company.  I’m sure you understand the importance of image and branding? My fiancée’s dress needs to be remarkable in every way. Understated, but bold. Classic, but forward thinking. Traditional, but modern. Timeless, but trend setting.”Jamie didn’t dare glance at John for fear of loosing it on the spot. He cleared his throat. “I see. Well, I’ve brought some exemplars..”“I’ll get tea,” John exited faster than was necessary.Jamie had laid out several of his sketches by the time John returned with the tea and a woman. Jamie squinted in confusion. “Darling, Claire, come sit.”  Randall directed at this woman.She came forward. It took a second for Jamie to realize this was Randall’s fiancée.  She was wearing medical scrubs and trainers. Her head was adorned with an obscene mass of unruly brown curls barely contained in an off center bun. She held her mobile in her right hand and the strap of a well worn leather cross body purse slashed between her bosom.  John coughed.Jamie immediately stood and introduced himself. When she shook his hand he caught sight of her eyes. He couldn’t even name their color. They were like the autumn turning of the leaves; brown and yellow, crisp and fragile. There was a quiet strength in her carriage. “Look at these, Claire.” Randall began to show her the sketches Jamie had prepared.Jamie cursed himself for his preconceptions. He’d subconsciously assumed Randall’s fiancée would be of the trophy wife variety – barely legal and full of silicone. “Hmm. This one’s nice.” Claire turned the sketch toward Jamie. “Aye.” It was the embroidered satin column dress. The one Jamie was partial to as well.“Nah darling. It’s too old Hollywood wannabe starlet.” Randall frowned and gently pulled the sketch from her hand. Claire simply smiled and sat back in her chair. Randall pushed three of the sketches toward Jamie, “these are promising.”Two were sleeveless halters and one heart shaped strapless. Jamie couldn’t see much of her figure, but he knew none of those would suit her.“Well, these are just common styles. I wasna sure of Ms. Beauchamp’s measurements or…” Jaime glanced quickly to Claire, “…body type.  Different styles generally work with different shapes. I’ll have an assistant take measurements…and perhaps a few photographs?”“Oh, god.” Claire smiled at Jamie as she tried smooth her hair. “This was not the best idea after spending the night in the PICU.”Jamie’s curiosity piqued, “what is it ye do, Ms. Beauchamp?”“I’m a pediatric oncologist. And please, call me Claire.” “I’ll have to start sending her prepackaged meals to the hospital. She has a tendency to miss meals when she gets over involved with a patient,” Randall patted Claire’s hand. “We can’t have you losing weight once these measurements are taken.”  Jamie saw her wince at his words, but then turned to smile at Randall.  “Any theme or specific preference, Claire?” Jamie asked.“Our professions are very important to us,” Claire said to Jamie, “and the ceremony can help Frank, so however you two think the dress should be, it will be fine by me.”Once again, Jamie cursed himself. He didn’t know much about brides. His sister’s wedding had been a low key affair. He just assumed the woman would be more interested in the dress.“Alright, well with the measurements, I’ll prepare more detailed sketches. Ye’ll have to come back for fittings.  The dress will be tailored specifically for ye.”Jamie noticed a pink tinge to her cheeks, but assumed it was the tea. He stepped out and found John in the hallway. “Get Marsali to take Claire’s measurements and bring me the camera, aye?”John raised a brow at his boss, “Marsali can take the photos.”“No, no.  I’d prefer to do it myself.”  Noticing John’s look, “this account is important. I wanna make sure I got everything.”Jamie and Randall stood off to the side while Claire’s measurements were taken. “I’ve got a good feeling about you, Mr. Fraser.” Jamie tried to keep his smile pleasant. “Here,” Randall pulled cards from his inside jacket pocket, “these are our business cards. Claire’s schedule is erratic so best email her directly about the fittings and cc me any designs or photos.”  Jamie noticed a third card. “Oh, that’s our wedding planner, Mary Hawkins, in case that’s of any use to you.”Jamie nodded. He knew it was none of his business, but couldn’t help himself. “How’d ye meet?”“Pharmaceutical conference. She was excoriating a rep regarding a faulty drug efficacy study.” Randall smiled. “I knew she was an unpolished diamond.”Jamie tried to puzzle out his meaning, but Claire was walking toward him. “Are you taking the photos?” Claire pointed to the camera Jamie was holding.“Aye. Just stand over by that window.”  She did as directed. Jamie raised the camera and heard Randall near his ear, “I’ll leave you to it.”“Bye, darling,” Randall shouted to Claire. At that moment the camera clicked. Jamie would keep that photo for the rest of his life. He’d keep it in his phone, on his desk, on their bedroom dresser, he’d show it to their son at his wedding, and he would pull it out when he held his first grandchild.

            A Holiday There Is: Boxing day        I absolutely loved writing one-shot fic “Twas two days before Christmas” for Tumblr prompt and had no intentions whatsoever to continue this story. Even though I fell in love with this Claire and Jamie myself. But I’ve received many comments asking me to write more.There’ll be more coming your way and can be found on AO3 in chronological order.Thank you for reading, giving likes and wanting me to write next instalment. It blows my mind.Loads of love. xxP.S. And loads of love to my Anne 💜 @eclecticstarlightconnoisseur​AO3Claire closed her eyes, lips curling into a Cheshire cat-like smile. She leans back, the coolness of the pub stone wall feels pleasant on her heated skin. She hears the crackles of ice in her Gin &amp; Tonic. Taking a sip, she feels her mouth explode into millions of stars as the drink slides over her tongue. The lime bites her tastebuds. She finds making a coherent sentence becoming more challenging as she consumes her third cocktail. Claire cautiously opens one eye to peer around the crowded room. The pub is warm and dimly lit, buzzing like a beehive with the sound of conversation, laughter, glasses clinking and slow soft jazz. Outside, it’s raining cats and dogs, the passersby hold onto their umbrellas as a buttress against the stormy wind. Ah, London.Inside, it smells of cigarettes and well-worn aged-wood. It’s toasty but has become too much for her liking. It makes the soft curls at her nape stick to the skin. But she doesn’t dwell on it too long as she sees Jamie coming back from the bathroom. It is still a mystery to her how just the sight of him makes her edges soften and a tight knot appear in her lower belly. Claire takes another sip of her G &amp; T, feeling the bubbles roll between her lips causing a prickle in her mouth. She is lost in thought, considering how she doesn’t like mysteries. But she decides to solve this one called Jamie Fraser.His bright hair shines with all the possible shades of red, even the ones she could not name. His jeans hang low, exposing the sliver of skin beneath his sweater like he doesn’t care. Claire has to hide a laugh inside her jumper sleeve when Jamie runs into a decoration hanging from the ceiling. He is so tall it brushes against his forehead. He curses. Surely something in Gaelic, Claire thinks. “All right?” She says, saluting her glass to him.“All right.” Jamie pours another glass of whisky for himself. He says something about waiters forgetting the salad she had ordered and if she wants him to go and ask… Claire barely registers the actual words, his Scottish burr is as smooth as melted butter, turning her blood boiling hot with need.“Shall we have a toast?” Fraser leans his glass to hers, eyes never leaving her face.She licks her lips and Jamie shifts his chair closer to hers, so he can drape his hand across her back.“To unexpected meetings.” Beauchamp lifts her cocktail. As Jamie’s thumb draws intricate patterns on her shoulder their conversation drifts into discussing one another day, the never-ending rain, and how good their drinks are. Claire mentions the documentary she saw recently on BBC and Jamie shares his love for Paolo Nutini’s music. They both agree that the guy is a bloody genius.Claire lets herself melt into him, her body relaxes against his. Her head falls down Jamie’s shoulder, hand lays atop his thigh. The Scot draws her closer and she can feel his lips brushing her forehead softly.They sit for some time allowing the silence to surround them.  Absorbing the atmosphere around them, the malty smell of good beer, of holiday decorations with their piney scent, and the howling of the wintry wind outside.“So, Sassenach, do ye sleep without yer bottoms?” Jamie smirks at her. She gives him a side-eye and laughs. He finds himself helpless around her. He feels lost in the face of feeling that somebody finds him truly funny. He watches as her lips, delicate pink and inviting, curl into a smile. Her giggles explode into laughter. Her smile could burn him from inside out and Christ, he would not mind being reduced to ash. “Is that a trick question, Fraser?” She leans back on her chair, pops a cherry tomato into her mouth feeling it burst with sweet juice. “It depends on the occasion.”Claire glances at him under her lashes and Jamie feels a hot lump stuck in his throat.Suddenly he remembers a picture of her in a red dress (God, that neckline) that she sent him in response to his  “I hope ye have a merry and very happy Christmas, Sassenach! XX”  He did not know that Claire’s breath hitched when he snapped a selfie of himself as a response. He looked dashing. The smart white shirt and half loosened tie made her let out a shaky breath.Neither did he know that just within two days he’d encounter the Sassenach again. On Boxing day head buzzing with business decisions, he walked toward the cashier at Ralph Lauren in Harrods, grasping a pyjama pants in his hands. That’s when his eyes noticed the mass of curls and he heard her high-class English accent moving among the clothing racks.“I’ll take the top.” Her hands clutching the pyjamas top from the same set he was going to purchase.“I’ll take the bottom.” Claire looked at him over her shoulder and he drowned in the whisky coloured depths again. They had a good laugh about the fact that this set of nightwear brought them together again. Jamie teased her for buying the pyjamas in men’s section and Claire asked him something that made her heartbeat in anticipation.“How often do you come to London?” Then Jamie had asked her to grab a drink and she led him to her favourite pub in Hackney.* * *“Care for a dance?” Beauchamp stands up, holding her hand out for him. She feels a bit crazy and just slightly drunk with the alcohol she had and with him being so near. The smell of his cologne, amber wood and sea coast, and the memory of his lips learning the lines of her body, causing her to be a little reckless tonight. But who cares?Jamie takes her hand, his fingers run through hers, her little anchor to hold on to. He leads her through the crowd. He feels his cheeks burn hot just from the nearness of her. When Claire’s hands wrap around his neck, he pulls her closer, fingers dig into the tender skin on her waist. She smells of lime, bright and juicy; of the lingering remnants of her flowery perfume and the smoke in her hair; she smells of hope, of the future.Her cheek is against Jamie’s. His stubble brushing against her skin, a bit scratchy, but she doesn’t care. For a second Jamie thinks she trembles in his arms, but he assumes it’s just his imagination.But she does tremble. Claire closes her eyes and lets him lead her. They sway slowly to the rhythm of the piano.She feels weightless and care-free. She feels warm, warm from his body pressed so close against her as they dance. Her heart beats frantically, something quite usual when Jamie’s around. When she opens her eyes she sees him looking at her. The roses bloom bright pink in her cheeks and she drops her gaze. “Would I embarrass myself if I’d say I like ye, Sassenach?” She looks up at him. And kisses him breathless. Her mind went blank. And they danced some more oblivious to the fact that the music has stopped. Nothing matters besides them being together here. In the city with the rain washing over the streets, the city of the alleys where time never stops, and the corner shops where bright vegetables spilt a paint blot in this grey winter.Within the confines of their own universe, time suspends as they walk together, hand in hand to Jamie’s car. When he kissed her eyelids and under eyes asking “What if I kissed ye here?” she did not know she ever needed to hear such questions from a man. But her knees went all wobbly and she ached so deep down the marrow of her bones.  Her heart thuds in her ears. His hair is the colour of burnt butter in the evening darkness of the car. There is a question on the tip of her tongue. Would you like to stay?Jamie knows now that she lives in the pastel pink Victorian house.She whimpers and sighs as his lips chart the map down her body. As he loves her with his mouth, she knows she cannot part with him just now.Later Jamie learns that the sun crawls into her bedroom about seven in the morning and that she does sleep without bottoms.

Thank you so much for all your continued support. I wrote the first draft of this fic in Feb. and I was sure it was something nobody would want to read. I’ve never been more happy to be wrong. Chapter 1 | Chapter 6Claire woke earlier in the morning than usual. She went about her routine as she would any other day, to be sure. Today was going to be a long day of preparation for the Reunion the next day. There was the tent to put up and food to cook, decoration and set up. She was definitely going to need some coffee.She made her way down the stairs and towards the kitchen. She noticed voices and the smell of eggs and coffee wafting through the air from the open door. She smiled and stepped over the threshold to witness a scene that made tears well up in her eyes.  Keep reading

            Fanfiction - Scalpel &amp; Needle        @mary-waitforit-lou: Maybe a From Hate to Love au, at first they can’t stand each other and then…
I asked for prompts a few days back and immediately felt the need to write this one. It’s a classical trope that I feel can be quite interesting. I received a couple of other ideas, that are already in store - some are meant to go later into my existing works. Thank you for inspiring me!Scalpel &amp; Needle Part I - Rivalry“I’d be bloody thankful if you didn’t come into
my OR like some kind of unwanted saviour and start to order me around!” Claire
snarled, ripping off her surgical cap, her curls exploding in the air after
sudden liberation, her hair bobble tearing with an audible “pop!”. “I didn’t ask for your help!”“The patient was crashing.” Jamie tried to
explain, remaining eerily calm in spite of the angry woman facing him, looking
like a rattlesnake ready to pounce. “Ye couldna possibly deal with all those
bleeders. I thought a second pair of hands…”“I already had a second surgeon!” She hissed,
pointing at the frightened young resident who had sought refuge against the
wall, clearly wishing to be swallowed by it – and away from the two galvanized
surgeons. “I was in control, using the technique I prefer! But you decided to
come and show off, like some goddam star!”“I was only trying to help, lass.” He grunted,
gripping his fists. His blue eyes were dark and dangerous, tumultuous seas
waiting for ships to wreck on their waves. “It seems to me ye have a bit of a
problem admitting when ye need help and it’s perfectly…”“Oh, you bastard!” Claire roared, advancing to
face him – even though he had the clear advantage of his imposing height.
“Don’t you dare call me “lass”, as
you do to the young nurses, melting them away to do your biding. Stop pretending
you know the first thing about me! You just want to please the board, so
they’ll give you the most challenging cases!”“I couldna care less about the board, Doctor Beauchamp.” Jamie said through
clenched teeth. “Ye should be thanking me that the patient isna heading to the
morgue - instead ye’re yelling at me like a mad banshee, because I wounded yer
pride.”Claire’s cheeks were throbbing with heat, her
chest constricted with a fury she couldn’t even begin to understand. She raised
her index finger and poked him on the chest, wielding it like a dangerous
dagger. “Stay the hell away from me and my OR, Fraser. I mean it!”“Mallaichte
bas! Fine!” He roared, raising his hands in exasperation. “I won’t meddle
again, as much as I think ye might need it. Ye blind woman, stubborn as a
mule…” And he reverted to clipped Gaidhlig,
grumbling in a low voice as he strode down the hallway.“Claire!” She heard the voice of her friend, Geillis
Duncan, gaping at her with her mouth noticeably ajar. Claire was panting, her
vision almost blurred from anger, as she contemplated James Fraser retreating
with a cold satisfaction. “What’s this ruckus all about? Is something amiss?”“Just my esteemed
colleague, James Fraser, being an insufferable prick.” She glared at the other
people surrounding her, frozen in contemplation of the spectacle, silently warning
them to return to their own business. “I really don’t know how someone can be
as egocentric, misogynistic, smug…”“Well, don’t hold anything back, darling.”
Geillis laughed, gently pushing her by the arm to a nearby resting room. “Yer
feud with the man is becoming legendary. There’s probably people placing money
to bet on yer next fight.”“Someone has to show him he’s not even half as
impressive as he fancies himself to be.” Claire puffed, filling a glass with
cold water from the machine in the corner and drinking it down. “Most people think him charming, Claire.” The
nurse pointed, sitting on the small couch – a myriad of unidentifiable stains
garnishing the old fabric. “A verra capable surgeon, kind and concerned with
his patients, humble but with a sharp mind, and a brilliant sense of humour.”“Damn Geillis, don’t you hold anything back either.” She rolled her eyes in disbelief.
“One would think you very enthralled by the man.”“Everyone – well, every lass and probably John
Grey too – kind of is.” The redheaded girl gave her a mischievous smile. “That
is one hell of a ginger fox, Claire. How can ye not want to ride that…”“That’s quite enough, thank you!” Claire hawked
and tried to tame down her revolting hair with her fingertips. “I happen to be
immune to whatever spell he has been casting around here.”“I just don’t understand why ye hate him so
much.” The nurse looked at her with studying eyes, slightly biting her index
finger, her nails a gaudy shade of pink. “Are you trying to conceal the fact
that ye actually find him attractive?” She said in a soft voice. “I know that
after Frank it’s hard for ye to…”“Don’t.” Claire said in a serious voice, the
shadow of a smile gone from her face. “Don’t say that. This has nothing to do
with Frank. I just don’t see what you see, that’s all.”“Alright, I’ll let the subject go – for now.”
Geillis stretched herself like a cat and grinned, preparing to resume her work.
“Drinks tonight at Leoch’s?”“Sure.” Claire nodded absentmindedly, already
studying her next patient’s chart. “I’ll meet you there after I finish my
colectomy.”“Behave until then, ye hear me!” She warned
Claire, leaving her alone to face another surgery.****Claire opened her locker, blood pulsing rapid
inside her vessels, so much so she felt the tidal waves of blood on her
temples. Like she had foreseen, a lonely envelope was there, a bit crumpled
after being pushed through the small gap. With shaking hands and a smile of
anticipation, she opened it. “It has come to my
attention that you had a rough day. I’m sorry to hear it. I thought I would
make it a little better – but this time I’m borrowing the words of a wiser man.
«My struggle is harsh
and I come back with eyes tired at times from having seen the unchanging earth,But when your laughter
enters it rises to the sky seeking meAnd it opens for me
all the doors of life.»I hope to see it again
soon. I shall miss your laughter every second you hide it away.With l Yours,Scalpel”It had started six months before. On a day when
night had forgotten to go away, leaving everything immersed in shadows, rain
pounding over the roof like a furious fist banging. She had lost a patient that day. She recalled
it vividly, because it had been the first since she had moved to Edinburgh. Not
only that – it had been a young woman, with the same hopes and dreams that she
had, heart broken into a million pieces but still hopeful. Losing her had been
like losing a piece of herself, an entire world shattered away under the lights
of the OR. Claire accepted the sympathetic words of her
colleagues, the gentle hands that touched her back, assuring her that not every
battle was meant to be won. But she had lost – so brutally, so completely, so painfully. She walked to the locker room and
bolted the door, allowed herself to cry on the floor, to sob until her heart
had melted and gone away. When she opened her locker to retrieve her
things at the end of her shift, she had found a sketch there, pencil on paper
like the tears on her cheeks. Someone drew a hand – elegant fingers with a thin
wrist, which eerily reminded her of her own – holding a scalpel. And touching
her palm underneath it, as if the fragile scalpel had been too heavy to hold on
her own, a second hand helped her to hold it. The touching image – it had
brought tears to Claire’s eyes – had been signed in a crooked handwriting. “Scalpel”.The drawing had been on her nightstand since
that day, a reminder that someone out there truly understood – knew – the loneliness of her work, the
hardships she endured and how much she needed a presence to hold her when her
strength failed her. The second gift came a week after that – a pressed
blue flower, perfectly preserved, clearly saved for quite some time between the
pages of a book. Claire inhaled it, hungry for the perfume and words still
trapped in it. A short note came with it – “Will
you make a home for it with you? Scalpel”. After a few weeks – time in which she had
received poems, caricatures and photos of landscapes – she decided that her
secret friend – for the mysterious person clearly meant to forge a relationship
with her through those small tokens – deserved an answer. She had scribbled it at home, sitting at her
desk – the pressed flower next to her, on top of an organized pile of paper –
and left it lodged on the door of her locker, where he’d certainly find it.“Dear Scalpel, I’m not sure why you
think me deserving of such kind attentions, but I have to say you seem to read
my mind! Not only I find everything you give me fascinating, but you seem to
guess when I’ll need it the most. If someone ever told me I’d have a secret
correspondent, I’d laugh and swear them insane. But in truth I find great
solace in you and cherish every thought you spare me. Thank you for being a true
friend – the more selfless kind.Cla NeedleP.S. – Of course you
know my real name, but it seems only fair that the both of us would have secret
code names. I’ve been told to be sharp as one - and equally resourceful.” And so
their correspondence became two-sided. A week hadn’t gone by without a sign
from him and Claire realized they were incredibly close – intimate, even. She
had tried to suggest for them to meet and talk in the cafeteria – at least for
him to reveal his name, so she could put a face on the person that meant so
much to her. His answer had been concise and clear: “One day I’ll tell you everything. But not yet.”Claire placed the note on her pocket, where her
fingers could brush it – touching it, savouring it through the next hours. She
headed for the pub to meet Geillis – blissfully unaware of Scalpel’s existence - wondering how one could be enamoured with a man
made only of words on paper.

The entirety of Europe was roasting in a seemingly interminable heatwave. 
“Bloody climate change.” 
It had been our constant refrain over the preceding four-and-a-half days as we shared ice packs in bed, whined about condensation-dampened sheets, and did our damnedest not to touch one another.  
Rather than face down the prospect of sweating through another night without air conditioning and sharing a solitary oscillating fan, Jamie and I were fleeing the city to a rental cottage at the base of a mountain in the Highlands. We were both living with the vague (and perhaps vain) hope that north (anywhere, just north) would be cool enough that we wouldn’t spend the weekend learning the sensation of our internal organs roasting.
And that is how this story begins.  The story of how Jamie and I conceived our first child.

            Once I was an Eagle        I’m completely blown away by your responses to this work. Thank you each and one of you who read it, left kudos, reblogged or just said a kind word.It means a lot &lt;3This second chapter was prewritten before and I did not want to make you wait! :)For those who’s been asking about posting in future I plan to update this fic once a week, probably on Wednesdays (but not necessarily).I’m still figuring out the way I want to tell this story but I guess we’ll just see how their relationship develops until the present times. At first, I thought of it as little flashbacks but now it seems more necessary to show all the steps of growing together before we arrive at the Angst.Once again excuse me for any mistakes that might be there. ( Yes, I’m still looking for my beta? ❤)It’s also available on AO3 :)Posting a little behind the schedule here but… Enjoy!1.The beginnings                                             CHAPTER 2: Sassenach“ How did you break your nose?” I asked him (out of nowhere to be honest) finishing the last stitch on his forearm. The tissue there was split about 3 inches long, quite deep. It ran atop his other scar (where did he get it from?) and once healed it would make a cross sign.“ Huh?” My patient lifted his head looking at me. For whatever reason, I felt my stomach turn into a warm pool. ( why?) That was the first time I had a chance to examine his face properly, to register his features in my mind. His eyes were strangely blue, the shade of blue that reminded me of my vacation to the Maldives. The stubble of gold reddish colour was sprinkled along the sides of his jaw (I wondered whether it was his style or he just did not bother to shave). His face was framed by short cut curls, sticking out slightly near his ears. (I had to fight an urge to tuck them behind).I nearly dropped an anesthetic when he spoke. The deep flush crept up my neck, reaching my cheeks when I realised I was staring at him.“ Ye didna ask me how I cut my arm but ye ask me about my nose?” Jamie’s eyebrows rose as he smiled, small dimple on his right cheek appearing for me to remember. “ Is it yer trying to compare the size of my nose and…” “ No.” I cut him off coldly, biting on my lip, his sudden remark threw my professional mask off.  The smile on his face was wiped out in seconds, eyes fixed on mine. I cursed in my mind (what is wrong with you, Beauchamp?). He was just trying to make a joke and I’m going to have PMS or why else I had snapped again? I almost physically felt the awkward silence that fell on the room, spreading its dirty hands to ruin any possible professional etiquette I tried to maintain. But, it did not have a chance when we spoke together.“ I’m sorry. I did not want to sound mean”.“ Sorry, that was verra stupid of me to say, Sassenach”.The phone vibrated in the pocket of my jeans before I could answer him. With quiet “excuse me” I pressed decline thinking that Geillis can wait a couple of minutes more, though she would say she’ll curse me with all her long line of witches in the family. “ What does it mean? Sassi-nak?” I asked taking the last band-aids (only with Disney theme left) from the drawer. Keep reading

Enjoy!Chapter 1: It Starts With GoodbyeWarm mug of tea in hand, Claire Beauchamp descended the staircase that divided her flat from her charming florist shop below.  She would open the store in approximately twenty minutes, but for now, the front door remained firmly locked, the “We’re Closed - Get Clover It” sign dangling in the front window.  Keep reading

 Jamie’s house to watch a movie.” I explained nonchalantly, peeking through the
 door to the living room, where my mother was watching a talent show, while
 nibbling plump strawberries. “Me and your father were
 big on cinema too…” A dramatic
 pause, as she grinned and glanced over to me. “…Just around the time I got
 pregnant.”“Hold your horses grandma,
 and don’t start any knitting extravaganza just yet.” I replied dryly,
 scrunching my nose, even as a volcanic blush crept along my neck. “We have
 been seeing each other for what - thirty seconds? Hardly prime-parent-material just yet.”“Can you imagine?” She
 continued in a dreamy voice, and I could swear falling stars shone inside her
 eyes, trailing quickly across the firmament of her imagination. “A little
 lady, with curly red-hair and amber eyes? Or a little lad, talking just like Jamie, your own duckling?”“Well, I’m going, before
 you decide the names of my future children, the schools they are to attend and
 their future careers.” I rolled my eyes, but the corners of my mouth pulled up
 on a tender smile - my heart was melting,
 just a little, when confronted with those sweet and hopeful images. “You
 were never like this with any of my previous boyfriends, though. What’s up
 with that?”“You never smiled like a fool when going out to meet them, too. A lot of firsts here.” My mother shot me a victorious look, swallowing the
 last red fruit in her bowl. “Some of them were nice young men. But I know Jamie - and he knows you. I wouldn’t trust anyone else to take care of you as
 he will, when I’m gone some day.”My chest tightened, the
 most bittersweet blend of love and preemptive longing gripping me viciously,
 and I padded to her and smacked her forehead with my lips, putting all my
 devotion in that silent kiss. “Let’s agree that those days are very far away. Who would spoil rotten
 my hypothetical children, if you weren’t around?” Keep reading

            Fanfiction - Magnificent Strangers        This fic won’t be very
long – I estimate about five chapters. If everything works out as I intended,
you’ll both laugh and be moved by it. There’s a lot of reasons why this story
feels very close to my heart and I hope you enjoy it, as I share the first
chapter from my food-induced coma this holiday. Merry Christmas! 🎄Magnificent StrangersPart I - Third CycleThere
are places where you half-expect to meet the man of your dreams: a dim
nightclub, while you dance around each other in a sweaty courtship; a Christmas
party, showered with copious amounts of expensive booze; a holiday at an
adults-only resort in Barbados,
crawling with other slightly desperate single people; a trendy pub after work
hours, eyes clashing from different corners of the room.And
then there are places where you’d never expect to meet anyone significant, much
less the love of your life. The
crowded and solemn wake of a relative, who happens to be a prominent figure in
the community. A dentist appointment, bound to leave you with two less wisdom
teeth and a swollen face for three days. A midnight impromptu trip to a
convenience store to grab sanitary towels, because your period arrived
unexpectedly, when you didn’t even bother to put on actual clothes underneath
your trench coat.  Or
a chemotherapy session, in the middle of your third treatment cycle. Today
is Chemotherapy Monday. Mondays used
to be for blues that lasted until Thursday, fishy lasagna at the canteen and
drinks with the girls. Now, Chemotherapy
Mondays are pretty much like Chemotherapy
Tuesdays and only marginally worse than Chemotherapy
Fridays. Four
months ago, I was showering after a passable nooky (with my then
beau-of-three-and-a-half-months Frank Randall), when I noticed a lump on my
right breast. It would only take two weeks to be diagnosed with stage two
breast cancer. Frank,
self-important and chivalrous (at least in his own notion of himself), promised
me we would “weather the storm
together”. His resolution, shaky like a drunken man after three days
of sobriety, lasted (surprisingly) until the day I shaved my hair. He
took one good look at me, bald and grinning, shook his head and told me he
couldn’t do it anymore. “It’s not
the hair.” Frank mumbled, as he neatly stacked a few meagre
possessions he had been leaving in my apartment into his overnight bag. “It’s the way you are always making
tasteless jokes about it all - as if everything is nothing but a punchline
waiting to happen.”“Well, don’t let me deter you.” I
went into the kitchen and filled up a generous glass of water. “I’d scream and pluck my hair out like
a proper woman scorned - but, you know.” I pointed vaguely towards my
hairless scalp and sat silently on the couch until he left. I
couldn’t tell him that humour felt closer to being alive than tears. I couldn’t
put into words that making a joke was a form of control I relished on, when
control was slowly being taken away from me. I felt like a dandelion, one
strong blow away from being scattered.  Keep reading
