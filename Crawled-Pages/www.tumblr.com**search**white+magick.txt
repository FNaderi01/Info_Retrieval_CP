            Candles: Color and Purpose        Candles are seen as the most powerful object for witches. If one lights a candle while reciting a chant or prayer for enlightenment, empowerment, and good health is one way to use a candle. One can also ward off negative energy and impart positive energy into one’s life using a candle also. Historical UsesBirthdays were the first ritual with candles used. Many believe the practice of wishing and blowing out the candle brought this wish to the gods who would grant it via the smoke. Candles represent earth (wax), air (smoke), water (melted wax), and fire (flaming wick).Magical UsesAlways be in the right frame of mind, or the spell will create an opposite effect intendedAllow candle to burn down on its own for most rituals When the candle has extinguished itself, the spell will be completeSome rituals and spells may ask for the candle to be extinguished and then re-lit the next dayNever leave a candle unattended Give decent amounts of time for the candle to burnChoosing a Candle Magickally disinfecting your candles before using them is very important, since the energy from those who shipped it may linger on the wax. It is good to make your own candles from scratch for this reason also. Avoid dipped candles such as white candles dipped into colored wax. Try to find ones solid color throughout  Cleansing Your CandleDepending upon your preference, you can do a few things to cleanse your candle, such as leaving it outside for a week in the garden to soak up the moon’s rays at night. For a less time-consuming cleansing, you may anoint your candle, using water and oils prior to the spell or ritual:Wipe clean with a paper towel, removing all dirt Prepare a solution of spring water, one teaspoon of sea salt, and warm until the salt dissolves. Allow to cool, and then pour back into the bottle. Keep this in the refrigerator for about a month for use over time. Intent. Stand in front of your sink, hold the candle in your left hand (nearer to your heart). Be very careful not to wet the wick, and pour a small amount of the sea salt spring water solution over the candle. If using a tea-light candle for quick burn time, remove the candle from its casing before cleansing with the water. Take a fresh paper towel and dry the candle very well and say the following: “This magickal water cleanses thee, with good intent and purity” (Robbins and Bedell, 2017).Inscribe the candle with a small, sharp knife or thick needle, and scratch your full name and your wish into the wax. It is not important that it be legible, nor the location where inscribed. The words will clout the spell more as the candle burns down. To anoint your candle, pour some pure vegetable oil into a bowl. This oil is used for most anointing, but if using a spell for health and well-being, you may mix in a few drops of other oils if you wish. Lavender is common for health and well-being spells and will make the magick more intense. Hold the candle in your left hand again and dip the first finger of your right hand into the oil and run it down the candle from top to bottom in a line. If anointing a tea-light, place it back in its casing, dip your finger into the oil, and smear it in a clockwork motion around the top of the candle wax. Say this invocation: “This magickal oil anoints thee, with all things good, magickally” (Robbins and Bedell, 2017). The candle is now cleansed, charged, and ready to be placed in a suitable holder in preparation for the spell you choose. Rhyming and repetition can help add punch to a spell. A lot of ancient and prewritten spells will rhyme with a poetic fluidity. Repeating the spell will give power to the message each time. The most magickal numbers that represent completion are 7, 9, and 12. To end the spell, you will need to close the ritual. Choose one of the phrases such as “and so it is” or “the spell is cast” or “so mote it be” before looking upward and saying “thank you.” Colorful UsesThe correct color is the most important thing with candle useSome spells are exact to the color needed, and others more flexible When in doubt, always use a white candle for it is neutral Color Correspondances WhiteCleansing homesPurifying spacesCreating harmonyInvoking spiritsImproving communication with othersSummoning guides and angelsFor use in every situation Blue Promoting restful sleepFinding the truthGaining wisdom and knowledgeInvoking psychic visionsCalming emotionsSuppressing angerAiding meditationMoving your houseBecoming more patient with othersCuring a feverHaving a better understandingProtection RedPromoting strength and vigorRejuvenating energy and staminaConjuring willpowerSummoning courageInciting passion and sexual loveSparking enthusiasmPrompting quick resultsWarding off enemiesBecoming more attractive to othersPinkHealing emotionsAttracting romanceBecoming more caringInviting peace and tranquility Healing riftsBanishing selfish emotionsProtecting family and friendshipsInvoking spiritual healingBeing more compassionate GreenAccumulating money and wealthPromoting prosperity and abundanceAccomplishing goalsGrowing plantsAttracting luckNegotiating employment matters and finding new jobsHastening conception and solving fertility issuesCasting out greed and resentment YellowIncreasing activityResolving health mattersNurturing creativity and imaginationPassing exams and learningAiding concentrationControlling mood swingsProtecting yourself when travelingPersuading othersHealing problems associated with the headOrangeIncreasing energy and stamina Improving the mind and memoryPromoting success and luckDeveloping business and careerHelping those with new jobsClarifying legal matters and justice Selling goods or housesCapturing a thief or recovering lost property Removing fearPurpleSummoning spirit helpBringing peace, tranquility, and harmonyImproving psychic ability Aiding astral projectionHealingEasing sadnessImproving male energy Summoning spiritual protectionBrownAttuning with the trees and earthPromoting concentrationHelping with decisivenessProtecting animalsAmplifying assertiveness Aiding friendshipsBringing material gainGaining mental stabilityConnecting with Mother NatureStudying and learningSilverSummoning the Mother GoddessDrawing down the moonConnecting with lunar animalsPurifying female energyImproving all psychic abilitiesAiding clairvoyance and the unconscious mindRidding negativityDeveloping intuition Interpreting messages in dreamsBanishing bad habitsGoldhealing and enhancing well-beingRejuvenating yourselfImproving intelligenceBringing financial gain and wealthWinning competitionsAttracting love and happinessMaintaining peace in familiesCosmic orderingBlackProtectionStrengthBanishingReversalHex-breaking SourceRobbins, Shawn, and Bedell, Charity.

Solar Eclipse MagickThe solar eclipse reigns on Monday August 21, a shadowy goddess of truth and awakening. This eclipse is an illumination of the shadow self, a time where our awareness dives inward. It will reign under Leo, a fiery sign of courage and compassion. Deep radical love will rise and the emotional body will be tended to.Cosmic Rituals:Mantra Practice: I Trust. This is a powerful expression because it forces to release, let go, and to honor the flow of your life. Say this mantra throughout the day. Write it down, post it somewhere you can honor its reminder.Candle Prayer: ignite the flame and watch it burn with such elegance. A divine notion of illuminating the darkness and your unconscious. Say a little prayer into the heat the rises, a whisper of your desire and intentions. Once you finish your prayer, blow out the cancel. Watch the smoke blend into the night.Crystal Work:Crystal Bath: soak with the crystals, their energy will infuser into the water. Aquamarine, Rose Quartz and Moonstone are the perfect combination for a goddess bath. Add in Peppermint or Lavender bath salt to enhance the healing energies.Mediation: Hold your crystals, feel their energy. Spend time easing the mind into your haven, use your crystals to access chakras, past lives, and emotions that you feel need tended to.Crystal Circle: cast a circle using small crystals or a crystal wand. Crafting or drawing the circle of energy for you to sit in will give you the space to work with your shadow self.Alter: choose a goddess, crystals, and herbs that embody what you want to manifest. The solar eclipse is a time of change, growth, and bravery.Journal: Write it all down. Every emotion, thought, and memory. Savor it all, embrace the pain and happiness that rises to the surface. Be kind and open with the emotional shadows that step into the light. Healing starts with vulnerability.Listen to Your Cards: seek guide from your oracle and tarot cards. This is the perfect time to see what your guides/spiritual counsel want to say.Yoga: step onto the mat and flow, sweat, and breathe. Connect your body and mind with each movement.

👁️ What you need to know ️👁️࿇ ══━━━━✥◈✥━━━━══ ࿇
The evil eye is a very powerful black magick curse cast upon someone, usually out of jealousy, envy, and sometimes admiration. The Evil Eye can be given by a human or by Jinn. It is also known that animals can cast the evil eye, too. What some people don’t know is that you can cast the evil eye upon someone unintentionally through admiration. It can also be cast by simply making a malevolent glare, wishing something bad would happen to a certain person or even thinking ill about them. It is normally cast without the victim ever having knowledge of it. 
Many of our cultures believe in the evil eye. The belief is that the evil eye causes great misfortune, injury or sickness. This is a popular belief in Italian culture, which is why they refer to it as the bad eye, or  The Malocchio. They believe that if a child is called beautiful, one must immediately spit on him to protect him from the Evil Eye.

  👁️ The 3 types of Evil Eyes 👁️
࿇ ══━━━━✥◈✥━━━━══ ࿇
It’s believed that there are three types of Evil Eyes;
1. unconscious: These harm people and things without even intending to. This may even be someone you love or who loves you. It is considered least powerful of the 3.
2.  Intent to harm: Even negative toxic thoughts about harming someone can cast the Evil Eye, because every thought has energy, and is constantly being released. Normally the person intends to have something removed from the person, and have it for himself.
3.  Unseen : the hidden evil which is the most severe one, and the hardest for the average person to see. Sometimes this can be brought on by Jinn or other powerful entities.
It is also widely believed that Gods can become jealous of human happiness and cast the evil eye upon them. This causes a great deal of dreadful misfortune for man. This is why  protection  is important.

 👁️ Protection from the Evil Eye 👁️
࿇ ══━━━━✥◈✥━━━━══ ࿇
A talisman is an object infused with magick that you would carry to defy evil forces. These when worn as an amulet, or carried with you can protect and sheild you. Such talismans are known as Nazar Boncuk charms or the Eye of Fatima. The eye symbol originally originated out of Egypt, and is said to see all that goes on in the universe, even hidden evil. The eye is a symbol of the unconcious mind, vigiliance and moral conscience. The often blue talisman reflects all the evil intent back to it’s onlooker. 
The colour blue, first came from Egyptian glazed mud, which contains a high percentage of oxides; the copper and cobalt give the blue colour when baked. It is associated with the element of water, good luck and good fortune. Blue also plays a factor in the protectiveness of it, hence why people adorned the things that they wanted protected from the Evil Eye with this particular shape and colour. The blue eye also exists in some forms of Hamsa, a hand-shaped amulet that originated in the Middle East. These talismans aren’t exclusively blue and are often even red, and are seen in many cultures around the world. 
Another way you can protect yourself is by tying a black thread around your wrist or ankle. This is good if you don’t have a Nazar laying around! In order to shield yourself fully from the curser, the best possible thing to do is remove yourself from their presence. Try to reveal as little personal information as possible to them, for they can use it to their advantage. Though not everyone is completely safe, because black magicians can summon Jinn to collect personal information.

Some Symptoms of the Evil Eye include…☠️ Chronic bad luck
☠️ chronic illness
☠️ hair or teeth falling out
☠️ constant accidents
☠️ an overwhelming feeling of negativity
☠️ family being affected as well
and at its absolute worst, 
☠️ it can even cause blindness or death.
࿇ ══━━━━✥◈✥━━━━══ ࿇
As you can see, this curse is no joke. My goal today is not to teach you how to cast this curse, but how to shield yourself and your loved ones from it. As a past victim of this, I highly reccomend you protect yourself from this. Your health may become at risk or your life may be put in danger. People who are close to you may be unknowingly casting this on you which can bring on misfortune and a slew of other issues. I am not saying that your friends and family are evil, but the power of our intention in our minds is unknown to most, and can be just as powerful as our actions. Everyday we must strive to think positively and keep our intentions in line with our ethics.
🦋 Have Angel Eyes instead! 🦋Thank you for reading,

Poppets!!! 
This could be an interesting way of creating a poppet. Alterations:Maybe instead of rubber hair bands use string or twine. If it want it to look more doll-like roll the ears around to the back and then you’d have a little pouch for herbs or crystals and whatnots (remember to sew it closed so nothing falls out).

2What do you want? What do you desire, crave, imagine?What ignites you?Inspires you? Warms your belly? Makes you smile?Do That.Follow the Feeling.When it comes to creating a vision board, you need to start with a vision. Understanding what you want and collecting mantras, images, words and phrases that allow you to feel that way. Having a tangible vision board is powerful, crafted with your hands rather than online.Vison boards can be any size or shape. When it comes to piecing together your vision, no rules, no boundaries. It’s a beautiful process of collecting things that resonate with you, your desired feeling. Devoting your time to create a vision board is sacred, a practice of mindfulness and tending to yourself. Think of it as a form of mediation and radical self-love.Creates a space. Set up a mini studio to begin your project. Candles, a cup of tea, crystals, statues and artwork. You can set up your space in your living room or backyard, it’s about creating your own sanctuary, wherever that may be.Get your tools. Magazines, online printouts, old photos, fabric scraps, stickers, markers, and scissors (etc). A collage of materials is what manifests into an inspiring piece.Follow your intuition. Do what feels good when it comes to putting everything together. You’re not making this vision board for anyone else but yourself, there are no expectations or requirements for you to meet, only that you find comfort in what you made.Display with love. Find a place to hang your board that you will allow you to see it throughout your day. I keep an empowering board at my desk and a travel board in my bedroom. Discover what place will give you the most interaction and stick with it. Make it a practice, a ritual to truly look and acknowledge your broad.Your wellbeing is rooted to self-care. Visions boards are great ways to illuminate ambition and to awaken the self. Nourish your desires, dive inward and follow the feeling.
