System Description[edit]
The ARC-34 was a military UHF AM radio that operated between 225.0-399.9 MHz and transmitted at 8 watts. It featured a separate guard receiver for monitoring 243 MHz, while simultaneously monitoring the active channel selected.  The unit was unpressurized, but a pressurized version, designated AN/ARC-133, could operate at altitudes up to 50,000 feet.  The radio system was designed by RCA, but some models were built by Magnavox.
