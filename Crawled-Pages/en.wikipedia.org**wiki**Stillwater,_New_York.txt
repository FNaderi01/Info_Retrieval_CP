History[edit]
  Perspective map of Stillwater from 1889 by L.R. Burleigh with list of landmarks
The area was occupied by Iroquois and Mohican natives when the colonial period began. In 1709, Peter Schuyler built Fort Ingoldsby in town because of its location on the frontier of the French and Indian Wars. A replica of Schuyler's fort currently serves as the Stillwater Blockhouse Museum. Settlers began arriving after 1730. During the American Revolution residents participated in the war, and part of the Battle of Saratoga was fought in the town so that the town now refers to itself as the turning point of the American Revolution.[citation needed][3]
Stillwater was established as a town in 1791, when Saratoga County was formed. In 1816, the hamlet of Stillwater incorporated as a village. In 1859, Mechanicville became the town's second village. The Stillwater Free Library was established in 1949 by Barbara Alexik and Elizabeth Beiter in the building formerly home to the St. John's Episcopal Church. The Stillwater United Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.[4]
Geography[edit]
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 43.6 square miles (112.8 km2), of which, 41.4 square miles (107.1 km2) is land and 2.2 square miles (5.7 km2) (5.07%) is water.
The east town line is the border of Rensselaer County and Washington County, marked by the Hudson River.
US Route 4, partly conjoined with New York State Route 32 follows the Hudson River through the town. New York State Route 423 is an east-west highway in the northern part of Stillwater.  New York State Route 9P is a north-south highway in the northwestern part of the town by Saratoga Lake. New York State Route 67 runs along the south town line.
