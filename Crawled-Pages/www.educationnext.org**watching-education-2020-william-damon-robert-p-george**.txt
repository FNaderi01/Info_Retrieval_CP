On March 26, 2019 at 4 pm, Fordham and Hoover will host two speakers on schools, patriotism, and illiberalism.
William Damon, director of the Stanford Center on Adolescence, will argue that schools must foster in their students a sense of purpose and a positive attachment to their society.
Robert P. George, McCormick Professor of Jurisprudence at Princeton University, will argue that good education means knowledge-seeking via open intellectual debate that challenges one’s  most fundamental beliefs and values.
More information is available on the event page, where you can also register to attend or to watch the live webcast.
