      Description:
      A set, more than a series, of stories about mothers of various Sith and particular circumstances...
      Notes:
      The title, like The Phantom Menace (but also not), is a Tenebrous quote from the Darth Plagueis novel. It's tongue-in-cheek as I don't think it's wholly accurate, but in context it does refer to like, advancing the Grand Plan.The subjects here, although I can't tell you exactly why I ended up writing about these multiple times over, are:-keeping future/canonically Sith  sons children (hopefully...) from being taken by the Jedi. (Because kidnapping and brainwashing children with or without parental consent is not a Good™ action)-interacting with "unconventional" (so far as much of canon is concerned) Hutts (Because this isn't Redwall, much as I remain somewhat fond of that, and we'd do well to have VARIED GROUPS OF ALIENS who incorporate normal complexity)

(the drama is not for science though) home-grown lightsaber crystals there's some sorta stalking behavior on the part of the Sith but it's slightly mystical PI level stuff not super intense or threatening Gratuitous Earth foods and animals pretend tea party Sith hugs ok to podfic
    Summary
      The honor of being a Jedi youngling ripped away from his parents? The traumas and ingrained cruelty of being pruned into a Sith ideal? Tema Damask decides neither of those are right for her little son Hego, and the only sensible course of action is a complex escape and maybe some training she picked up...
(Guest starring Caar Damask and Rugess Nome (aka Darth Tenebrous) plus a handful of OCs)
Based on the prompt:Plagueis’s mother (please name her) decides that she’d rather him not be either a Sith or a Jedi, so runs off with him and trains him herself!  Fun family time with lightsabers ensues! With guest appearance by disappointed Tenebrous!From the Jedifest Alien April treat round.
