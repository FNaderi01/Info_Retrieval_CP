    Summary
      What happens when you mix a needy, hyper-sexual, girl-loving mutant terrapin with a needy, sexually-repressed, music-loving human girl? Heartache -- and sexual tension galore. For Mikey, it was love at first sight; for Lisa, it was terrifying hope as she attempted to learn how to trust again. It's a good thing, then, that these two are head over heels for one another.

    Summary
      [A 2014/2016 based fic](Y/N) (L/N) lives in a practically abandoned apartment building in the Meatpacking District, New York. Her main way of getting food is stealing it, she has a pretty tragic backstory like any good protagonist and her best friend is a rich girl with issues. However, there is one thing that makes her stand out a little more than everyone else in New York; she's friends with giant mutant turtles.[WARNING! This fic contains mentions/thoughts/attempts of suicide, cutting, abuse and depression. I highly recommend that you DO NOT read this fic if you are sensitive or easily triggered by any of these themes!]

    Summary
      "They say the dawn symbolizes a new beginning. With the sunrise comes hope, joy, light...everything that makes life worthwhile."For thirteen-year-old Scarlet, the sunrise means she's lived to see another day. An orphan on the run, she's taught herself to get by on the cruel streets of New York City, stealing and sleeping wherever she can to endure. Any hope she once had for herself has faded, replaced by nothing but a drive for survival. She's trapped in the never-ending maze that is her life, and she knows there's no way out...but deep down in her young heart, she longs for something to change. For a certain red-masked turtle, the blazing red of the sunrise reflect his anger. Misunderstood by his family, he feels there's no one in the world that truly understands him, who sees him for the turtle he is behind his mask of fury. Deep down, he doesn't want to be angry-but he doesn't know how to stop. All he can do is pray for a fresh start as he leaves everything behind, that there's enough light within his soul to expel the darkness that threatens to destroy him.When the two cross paths, perhaps a new light will shine on them both. "Thank you for being my sunrise."
