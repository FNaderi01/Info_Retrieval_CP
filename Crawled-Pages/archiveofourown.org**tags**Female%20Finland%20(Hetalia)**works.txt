    Summary
      Oscar Cooper hadn't had the best start in life, and lacked the safe school life and friends most teens his age had. But after throwing his lot in with a group of eccentric, but loveable kids he met during his first ever detention, things began to look up. He now had a possibility for friendship, and possibly even romance in the form of the rough, but well-meaning Michael Jones.Of course, these things haven't rid him of his demons, or the lingering effects of his past, but now he has a chance to fight them. As the group struggle to bring together a shattered community, they each battle their own myriad of issues, and just hope they can survive high school despite these.
