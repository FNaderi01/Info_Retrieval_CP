"Heroes" is the 12th studio album by English singer-songwriter David Bowie, released on 14 October 1977 by RCA Records. It was the second installment of his "Berlin Trilogy" recorded with collaborator Brian Eno and producer Tony Visconti, following Low (released earlier that year) and preceding Lodger (1979). Of the three albums, it was the only one wholly recorded in Berlin. "Heroes" continued the ambient experiments of its predecessor, albeit with more pop elements and passionate performances, and featured contributions from King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp.[5]
"Heroes" was the most well-received work of Bowie's Berlin Trilogy by music critics on release, and was named Album of the Year by NME and Melody Maker. It was also a commercial success, peaking at number 3 on the UK Albums Chart. The title track remains one of Bowie's best known and acclaimed songs.[6] The album has been reissued multiple times and was remastered in 2017 as part of the A New Career in a New Town (1977–1982) box set.
Like Iggy Pop's The Idiot (co-produced and co-written by Bowie), the "Heroes" album cover is an allusion to the painting "Roquairol" by Erich Heckel.[7][8] An altered and obscured version of the album's cover artwork later appeared as the artwork for Bowie's 2013 album The Next Day.

Production and style[edit]
Recorded at Hansa Tonstudio in what was then West Berlin, "Heroes" reflected the zeitgeist of the Cold War, symbolised by the divided city. Co-producer Tony Visconti considered it "one of my last great adventures in making albums. The studio was about 500 yards [460 metres] from the Berlin Wall. Red Guards would look into our control-room window with powerful binoculars."[9] Earlier in 1977, Kraftwerk had name-checked Bowie on the title track of Trans-Europe Express, and he again paid tribute to his Krautrock influences: the title is a nod to the track "Hero" on the album Neu! '75 by the German band Neu! – whose guitarist Michael Rother had originally been approached to play on the album[10] – while "V-2 Schneider" is inspired by and named after Kraftwerk's Florian Schneider.[11] Despite the German influences, the album was recorded with Bowie's British and American collaborators, with no input from German musicians other than backing vocalist Antonia Maass.
Masayoshi Sukita's cover photo was inspired by German artist Erich Heckel's Roquairol.[12] Bowie said that the quotation marks in the title "indicate a dimension of irony about the word 'heroes' or about the whole concept of heroism".[13]
Brian Eno instigated Robert Fripp's involvement. "I got a phone call when I was living in New York in July 1977," the guitarist recalled. "It was Brian Eno. He said that he and David were recording in Berlin and passed me over. David said, 'Would you be interested in playing some hairy rock 'n' roll guitar?' I said, 'Well, I haven't really played for three years – but,
if you're prepared to take a risk, so will I.' Shortly afterwards, a first-class ticket on Lufthansa arrived."[14] Upon arriving at the studio, and suffering from jet lag, Fripp recorded a guitar part for "Beauty and the Beast": this first take was used in the song's final mix.[citation needed]
Although "Heroes" continued Bowie's work in electronic[15] and ambient music styles[16] and included a number of dark and atmospheric instrumentals such as "Sense of Doubt" and "Neuköln", it was regarded as a highly passionate and positive artistic statement,[9][11] particularly after the often melancholy Low.[17] The lyrics for "Joe the Lion", written and recorded at the microphone "in less than an hour" according to Visconti, typified the improvisational nature of the recording.[18]
Eno employed his Oblique Strategies cards during the recording of the album. Stories suggest they were used during the recording of instrumentals such as "Sense of Doubt".[19]

RCA Records marketed "Heroes" with the slogan "There's Old Wave. There's New Wave. And there's David Bowie ..."[11] It enjoyed a positive critical reception on release in late 1977,[6] Melody Maker and NME both naming it "Album of the Year".[30][31] It reached No. 3 in the UK and stayed in the charts for 26 weeks, but was less successful in the US where it peaked at No. 35. The album was released in Germany with the title track renamed ""Heroes"/"Helden"" and partly in German. An early instance of the album's enduring influence is John Lennon's comment in 1980 that, when making his album Double Fantasy, his ambition was to "do something as good as "Heroes"."[6][30] Rolling Stone highlighted Eno's contribution, contending that after Bowie's "auteurist exploitation" of the former on Low, "Heroes" "prompts a much more enthusiastic reading of the collaboration, which here takes the form of a union of Bowie's dramatic instincts and Eno's unshakable sonic serenity".[32] The Village Voice critic Robert Christgau was less receptive to Eno's contributions, particularly the second side's instrumentals, saying that they are "interesting background" but "merely noteworthy as foreground, admirably rather than attractively ragged", in comparison to "their counterparts on Low".[33] In the Voice's annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll, "Heroes" finished 21st in the voting for 1977's top album.[34]
Several songs from the album were played live on Bowie's Isolar II Tour in 1978, released on the live album Stage the same year, and again from a different venue in 2018 with Welcome to the Blackout. Philip Glass adapted a classical suite, "Heroes" Symphony, from this album as a companion to his earlier Low Symphony. The title track has been covered by numerous artists, for example as an encore by subsequent incarnations of King Crimson, and Billy Mackenzie sang "The Secret Life of Arabia" in 1982 for the B.E.F. LP Music of Quality and Distinction. Several tracks were used in the film Christiane F. Bowie performed as himself in the film.
The cover of Bowie's 2013 album, The Next Day, is an altered and obscured version of the "Heroes" cover. This version has "Heroes" crossed out and Bowie's face obscured by an opaque white box reading "The Next Day".

Reissues[edit]
"Heroes" was first released on CD by RCA Records in the mid-1980s. It was reissued in 1991 by Rykodisc with two bonus tracks. The 1991 edition was released in the UK on CD, cassette and LP by EMI Records, and was subsequently rereleased on a numbered 20-bit SBM AU20 Gold CD edition. A further CD release in 1999 by EMI/Virgin, without bonus tracks, featured 24-bit digitally remastered sound.
In 2017, the album was remastered for the A New Career in a New Town (1977–1982) box set released by Parlophone that September.[35] It was released in CD, vinyl, and digital formats, as part of this compilation and then separately in February 2018.[36] A volume shift in the 2017 remaster of the song " 'Heroes' " received ire from fans and critics, but Parlophone proceeded to describe it as intentional and unalterable,[37] because of damages in the original master tapes. After the critical voices would not lessen, a statement was released on the official Bowie website announcing corrected replacement disks for the "Heroes" CD and LP;[38] the replacement disc offer lasted until June 2018.[39] The amended remaster featured on the replacement discs was also used for the standalone CD and LP release of "Heroes" in February 2018.[40]
