    Summary
      This is my first fanfic and it will be a rather long fic, it's the story of Sanguine D. Araluen and her twin Kieran. They're the children of the captain and first mate of the now-forgotten Blood pirates, part of the greatest generation, and they are both devil fruit users. The twins had a very messy childhood bouncing in and out of the cannon timeline. Along the way, they make great friends, may kill some, fall in love, and find out the truth on why their parent's crew was erased from history.  Check notes for any chapter-specific information.

    Summary
      An SI story.Most SIs get powers, or start off weak, or any of a multitude of ideas...but all, or at least most, remain human.Most One Piece SIs meet up with the Straw Hats, join their crew, and have some very entertaining adventures.This poor bastard gets neither.Follow Yoshimura Kaneki through the South Blue and beyond, as he joins a crew that, for better or for worse, is destined for infamy...Please comment if you have anything to say!
