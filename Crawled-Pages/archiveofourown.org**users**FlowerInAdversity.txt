    Summary
      The cultivation world thought the Yiling Patriarch died from qi deviation years ago. Deep inside Lotus Pier, there is a forbidden area personally created by Yungmeng Jiang's sect leader, Jiang Wanyin and carefully tended by the lady of Lanling Jin, Jiang Yanli. A closely kept secret houses the slumbering form of their adoptive brother. Then little Jin Ling decided to sneak in to the forbidden paradise.(prompt: AU where Demonic Cultivation shattered Wei Wuxian's soul before Jin Zixuan and Jiang Yanli's deaths and he went into a death-like state. Since nobody's ever done demonic arts before, nobody's sure if Wei Wuxian is alive or dead so they preserve his body and watch over him.)

  Summary
    Fakir’s got a pretty solid gig going.He’s 24, halfway through his doctoral program, and he only has about a year left of student teaching. He’s got his best friend by his side (pants or no), his best friend’s girlfriend isn’t actively trying to kill him (yet), he’s got a comfortable apartment, and aside from his seminar being full of idiots, things are about as good as he could hope for.Well, aside from the horrifying fact that he’s kind of falling in love with the sweet red-headed student in his Senior Seminar, but let’s not talk about that. Lord knows he won’t.  [One shot series in which Ahiru makes Fakir question all of his life choices, Rue is out for blood, Mytho is a Horrible Friend who won’t put pants on, and Fakir-much like his future, he’s convinced-ends up on the floor. A lot.]

    Summary
      In which Bond is a retired naval commander with too much house, Q is a mechanical engineer with too many sisters, and they have lengthy conversations about decorum, bonnet-ribbons and philosophy in Regency England.~“I just thought you might go pay a visit," his mother suggested.“Me?” Q asked, aghast. “Pay a visit?”“He must be starved for proper gentleman company, now that he’s settled in so far from London--”“I am far from proper gentleman company.”“--and perhaps if you befriended him he could introduce you to some nice heiresses.”“Heiresses?” Q repeated, baffled and horrified. “What in the world would I do with heiresses?”
