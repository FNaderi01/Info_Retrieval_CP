Vigilante Izuku Vigliante Denki Shinsou Eri Eijirou Katsuki Inko Neito
    Summary
      Izuku Midoriya only ever wanted to be a hero. He had no idea he would end up being one for another dimension where heroes are almost as bad as villains- taking what they want when they want. He wakes up to another, slightly older version of himself begging for help for multiple reasons. Other Izuku has many secrets and shares the one that that destroys Deku's world- Shouto Todoroki is a villain and he's the 'hero' they need to rid of. Now, Izuku drags Deku and Shigaraki to his dimension to things started and things only get weirder the longer they stay. Endeavor is the good guy, Izuku has a quirk, Katsuki is originally quirkless and friendly and that version of Eri is in love with Izuku.The worst part of the whole thing.... is Tenko Shimura is a hero that Shigaraki always wanted to be and he's dating vigilante Izuku.Will they be able to save that world so Deku and Shigaraki can return to their own or will they be stuck there trying to fix the broken society that crushes the weak instead of protecting them?

    Summary
      “Is Eri on a date?” Hitoshi cooed, a huge, uncharacteristic grin forming on his lips. “Hang on, if Eri’s on a date and you’re here— are you spying on their date?”“I’m observing,” Shouta grumbled.—Five times Shouta definitely did not trust Izumi Kouta, aka the-guy-who-once-punched-Deku-in-the-balls, to be near Eri, and one time he did.

    Summary
      2149/01/31Eri sucked in a breath and tried to feel for the telltale buzz in her horn that told her she wasn’t in the present.…Nothing. She was back. She was really back. “Eri!” Izuku’s voice finally re-registered in her ears and he was shaking her shoulders, gently, but urgently.“I’ll go to UA!” Eri blurted out before she could think. If she was back, it had only been a second while she had lived more than an entire decade. If she was back they had a chance to change fate. If she was back, she had no time to lose. Izuku looked at her, concerned and confused. “Eri…” He said slowly, “What did you see.”It wasn’t a question. Eri took a deep breath, gathering her thoughts as much as she could.“The end of the world.”orEri gets a fifteen year free trial of the future and experiences the end of the world. Back in the present, she works with Izuku to use their positions as vigilantes to make a change and prevent that future. Eri doesn't care about her consequences and Izuku wishes she could just experience a normal life. Like hell that's ever gonna happen.

    Summary
      “Ok, so I may have lied to my entire family about having a boyfriend just so I wouldn’t be teased by Natsuo, who’s not even gonna be there. I hired a guy who works at the ice cream parlor to pretend to be my boyfriend for two whole weeks, cause I’m smart that way. Nothing bad’ll happen, though, except maybe scaring him so bad with my nutcase family.” In which Kyoka has told her crazy-ass family that she’s bringing over a “boyfriend”, when in reality she’s as single as the one writing this (sad, but true). Enter Denki, acquaintance from her favorite ice-cream place, fake boyfriend to go. Of course, Mina is always right. Almost always, at least.

    Summary
      The day Eri and Izuku met was the day their fates were decided. He rescued her; liberated her from immense darkness: and at the same time, entered his own hell. Throughout his path, He was torn apart. Betrayed. Eaten. He was pushed down again and again. And still, he fought on. He persevered through all the pain. To see a future where they could smile, and be together. If things had been different- if he could’ve seen what would become of them in that fateful, unforgettable encounter. Maybe he would’ve turned away. But the choices of the past can’t be undone. So he carries on. Taking it upon himself to make a better tomorrow.

    Summary
      Denki didn't expect working two jobs would be so... confusing.Of course, he had his high school friends and they were insane along with him, but a second friend group? That's just something he didn't think he could handle. But he did.Along with that second friend group, came confusion he thought he left behind in high school when a certain lilac-haired man literally stepped into his life, launching him into another tornado of pining and fear.-Welcome to muffins and pages / needles and petals, in which Kaminari is the ball in a game of ping pong between the Baku- and Dekusquads and falls hard for the second ball in the game, a certain Shinsou Hitoshi.

      "This list was made by Nezu, in cooperation with myself and the faculty of Crowley Memorial University, to line out things the group that is known as the “Goetia Research Institute (of the Rediscovery of Magic and other Paranatural subjects)” -henceforth referred to as the GRI for simplicity- are restricted from doing on UA grounds or in public. This list was a pain and I have a migraine. Please contact me, Nezu, or CMU faculty for additions or revisions. Below this preface is a chart explaining the individual identities of the known GRI members.-Eraserhead/Shota Aizawa, Class A Homeroom Teacher, UA"

    Summary
      The world is in a panic. Ten years ago, scientists started noticing the Moon's rapid approach. With the seas rising and the moon waiting to shatter the Earth, humanity is rushing to develop technology to (hopefully) move to another planet.But then there's no need to. Because they find the source of the problem.Midorya Izuku, fourteen years old and falsely diagnosed Quirkless smashes a sludge villain into bits with a meteor brought directly from space using a super powerful long ranged Telekinesis(and smashing a bridge at the same time)! And apparently, he was unconsciously pulling on the moon ever since he manifested his Quirk! How funny is that?Now the only problem is to teach him how to use his Quirk before the end of the world is brought upon them.And what better place to teach him than hero school U.A.? (Or U.A. basically buys Izuku)

    Summary
      Eri's quirk is "rewind", it allows the user to reverse a living individual body to a previous state (doesn't work on non-living objects) and allows the user to let their own body travel backwards in time, because of her quirk she was captured by Overhaul so he can use her powers to fulfill his dream.Midoriya Izuku is a plain boy who later received his quirk called "forward", it allows the user to proceed a living individual body to the next state (doesn't work on non-living objects) and allows the user to let their own body travel forward in time.All for One had a deal with the villain Dragonsbreath (Midoriya Hisashi), but Dragonsbreath couldn't keep it so he decided to kill him and his family as a punishment, after killing Midoriya Hisashi and his wife he saw a small child with green hair and a horn sticking out of the left temple, All for One then gave that child to Overhaul to strenghten their alliance.
