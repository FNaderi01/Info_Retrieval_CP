The whole James Roberts/Megatron controversy is wayyy overblown and 
people are treating James Roberts like he’s writing Megatron as if he 
never did anything wrong but let’s not forget the following points: Keep reading

There was a time when we thoughtwe could reach the Dark amongst the stars.There was a time when it felt likeDestiny was ours to reshape.But now that our World has comecrashing down, tearing us apart…Was it worth what’s left of it?Bones and blood, flesh and soul.Trust and betrayal, craving and revenge.Hate and bitterness where once waswarmth, belonging, unity, love.Even if we almost never dared to say it.I never stopped, and I tried, gods, if I tried.Did you?{ @adventurepunks }(( This is both a “good luck” present (you know why) and also, and perhaps especially, a heartfelt “thank you” for having put up with my crap and my dumb arse me in the past few weeks. I don’t have the words to express how much that has meant to you, so I’ll just say that I’m really glad that you’ve taken such a liking in writing with me and dealing with me in general. It’s a precious gift and I intend to do my best to cherish despite my tendency to mess up. Merci beaucup pour tout! ))
