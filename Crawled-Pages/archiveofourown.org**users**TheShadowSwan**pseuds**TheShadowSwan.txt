      Skull was serving as a living battery for the world for long enough, but even her tolerance had limits, so when she died in the Future That Never Was she simply... refused to come back. Thanks to that she found her Territorry, her Family, her Freedom and maybe even her Equal.

    Summary
      The moment the Goblet of Fire spat Harry's name out, it was second year all over again. Shunned by most of Hogwarts and made out to be an attention-seeking liar, he feels more isolated than ever.When a chance encounter with his new Defense professor leads to an offer he can't refuse, Harry's long trek down into darkness begins.It starts out slow but once he's in deep enough to notice, only one question remains: does he even want to go back? And what is this strange connection he feels to Voldemort once he allows himself to give the Dark Lord a chance? Eventually... letting go seems like the easiest thing in the world.
