    Summary
      "Are you drunk?" "What? No!" Madara tilted his head to the side and blinked owlishly. A sheepish smile overtook his innocent expression, "I am tipsy though." He admitted, dangling a flask between them. "Give me that." Hashirama sighed, exasperated, "Why are you even drinking? Did something happen?" Madara’s eyebrows furrowed together, "Happen? What?" he shook his head. "No. No. I- that's my liquid courage," He gestured at the flask "You're holding my liquid courage,” he hummed to himself thoughtfully, “Maybe you'll need it too, Later... Maybe."

    Summary
      Clan Law dictates that no clan head or heir shall marry another, or fornicate, in order to maintain the purity of the bloodlines. Mikoto was never a very good listener anyway. Then, Mikoto and Shikaku fell in love and had a child that wasn't supposed to exist. It all kind of snowballs from there.

    Summary
      Even heartbroken and betrayed, Madara will still do everything in her power for her loved one's happiness. If that means hiding the petals she's began coughing up and walking away from the man she once considered her best friend, who perhaps in another lifetime could have been more, so be it.Maybe, just maybe, she can find happiness somewhere else. She's already broken her bond with... him once before. She truly has nothing left now, she may as well let go of the ruins of what once was to set herself free.

    Summary
      This is a work in progress, I would love to complete it, but I'm flying blind and have no idea where I'm going yet.The war was over for everyone but Harry. Trapped in a world that moved on without him, Harry Potter, a 28yo war general and Auror has spent the last decade in a war dealing with the fallout from Voldemort's defeat. He's finally done only to be yanked into another universe altogether and back into his past just because no one bothered to doublecheck the summoning mirror. Oops.

    Summary
      Harry might have ended up in the past against her wishes, but now that she was already there you could bet your life on the fact she'd make the most of it.Fighting Death Eaters, evading Aurors and Ministry attention was an old game and she'd only gotten better at it with age.Accidentally becoming the Lady Black and adopting a teenager hadn't really been part of the plan, but... Harry's plans never worked out like she wanted anyway.
