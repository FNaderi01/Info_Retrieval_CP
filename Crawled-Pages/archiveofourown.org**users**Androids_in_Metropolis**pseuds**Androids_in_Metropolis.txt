    Summary
      Lucifer has a soft spot for the Detective's spawn and agrees (well offers) to look after her when she is sick with chickenpox...What he doesn't know is that due to the proximity to Chloe he is in fact not invisible and the Devil never needed vaccines.

    Summary
      Lucifer wakes up ill, assuming he has been poisoned. The Detective comes when he calls...No one has ever done that before. * I am crap at summaries, but essentially Lucifer is sick, his dad/God was abusive and Chloe is always there when he needs her **

    Summary
      He hadn’t moved from his room except to pee since 3pm the day before. He hadn’t welcomed his dad home, or made dinner...he had fallen asleep, woken up, realised that he had missed his dad coming home, and cried himself back to sleep; What was wrong with him? Why couldn’t he be the good kid his dad deserved? Of course, he tried, but it was never good enough. Stiles knew that. His dad didn’t want him. Why would anyone want him?

    Summary
      Rickie wasn’t strictly religious; He didn’t really believe in God, per se, but his doubt didn’t keep him from praying to something to become straight...for his parents to get on...for people to stop bullying him and for the pain to stop for the world to change for the…Rickie prayed for a lot of things, for a lot of people.
