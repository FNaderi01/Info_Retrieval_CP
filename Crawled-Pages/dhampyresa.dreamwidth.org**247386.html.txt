Antlers is based on a short story called "Horns." It's a little different based on the trailer but it looks like they're keeping the bones the same.

I had no idea! Thank you for telling me. Now do decide to read it before/after seeing the movie -- what do you think?

I would wait until after, I think. If they keep the ending (which they may not tbf), you'll want to go in without knowing.

Hello new Magnus Archives listener! I am always on for spoiler-free babbling. It's a good journey, isn't it?

It's a great journey! One I might have joined earlier if anyone had told me it involved Jonny D'Ville before I had to find out for myself post-Death to the Mechanisms lol I miss the Mechanisms ;_;I'm hoping to make a post about my current theory (the fae are behind it all) before it gets (even more) completely smashed by s3 like (almost) all my other theories have been. No lie I am very much enjoying the opportunity to be all "conspiracy theorist at stringboard" if that makes sense

No lie I am very much enjoying the opportunity to be all "conspiracy theorist at stringboard" if that makes senseTotal sense -- it's such a fun show for doing that. In some of the Q&amp;As Jonny Sims and Alex Newall have talked about being equally "conspiracy theory stringboard" on their side trying to keep track of exactly which bits of information have been dropped in the show, and generally trying to play fair with the audience. They are extremely disapproving of shows which do the SHOCK TWIST WHICH NO-ONE SAW COMING because it MAKES NO FUCKING SENSE AND DID NOT HAVE ANY GROUNDWORK LAID FOR IT.One I might have joined earlier if anyone had told me it involved Jonny D'Ville before I had to find out for myself post-Death to the Mechanisms OTOH, I guess it means you can now be an Elder Fan to all the newbies who are just now discovering the Mechanisms as a result of TMA. *g*

Btw, in case you haven't found them already, I can rec Jonny Sims's lockdown Twitch streams if you want some chill ramblings:https://www.twitch.tv/jonnywaistcoatZero knowledge of gaming required. There's also the MacGuffin and Co streams (MacGuffin and Co being Jonny and spouse Sasha Sienna), usually RPGs of some kind, frequently featuring Frank Voss as a guest:https://www.twitch.tv/macguffinandco
