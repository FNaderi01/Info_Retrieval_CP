    Summary
      She’s not really sure what prompted her to do it.  Okay, that might be a bit of a lie.  Sure, she’s not completely positive of her reasoning, but she would bet Oliver’s fortune that it had quite a bit to do with the four empty bottles of wine littering her countertop and the three other women lounging around her apartment in various states of undress.She doesn't want to be cute anymore.  She's sexy and she's going to prove it.

    Summary
      When Oliver Queen signs up for a computer programming class at Starling University, he doesn't realize the girl he's been crushing on since his junior year is the TA for the class.  Ever since they first met, she's never seemed interested in him, but the pride of the Archery team isn't used to not getting what he wants.  And Felicity Smoak is definitely what he wants.

    Summary
      Once upon a time, a plucky college junior donned a red hoodie and butch boots, fired up her rusted-out Le Baron, and went on a road trip to Palm Springs (to visit caustic Grandma Mars). Along for the ride (because who doesn't love road trips?) are: her vivacious heiress roommate, Lilly, whose constant gift-giving hides a secret agenda: Lilly's somehow-too-perfect, future-senator brother: and Lilly's surly celebutante ex, who sports a suspiciously toothy grin, and a sackful of red apples.

    Summary
      During her sophomore year at Hearst, Veronica takes on your run-of-the-mill blackmail case: the clients hate her, the evidence is impossible to destroy, and her ex turns out to be a bit of a distraction, but Veronica is a sucker for a damsel-in-distress. Even if the damsel is an intoxicated, pissed off Carrie Bishop.
