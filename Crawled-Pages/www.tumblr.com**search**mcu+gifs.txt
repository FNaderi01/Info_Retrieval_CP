My little art tribute to Bucky Barnes &lt;3 
I talked about this a lot before, but I started to really 
appreciate him as my disability representation. It gets me so emotional,
 especially the Wakanda scenes, when he’s at peace &amp; without prosthetic arm. I truly hope he’ll get some happy story-lines in the future.

”I’m just a kid from Brooklyn.”A tribute to one of the best characters of the MCU, brought to magnificent life thanks to the hard work of Chris Evans. He not only gave us a living incarnation of Captain America but imbued him with the best of his personality and vulnerabilities. Thank you for 8 years of the best Steve Rogers we could’ve hoped for, and no matter what happens in Endgame, we’re with you until the end of the line, Cap.instagram + twitter: pineapplebreadsEdited on April 23, 2020 to add the final frame.+ (Iron Man tribute) Keep reading
