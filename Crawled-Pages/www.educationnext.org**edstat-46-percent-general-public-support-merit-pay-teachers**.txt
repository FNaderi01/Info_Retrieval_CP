According to the 2017 Education Next poll, support for merit pay for teachers among the general public has dropped from 67 percent in 2010 to 46 percent in 2017. Though the public is showing an increased resistance to changing teacher policies, including those that institute merit pay, end teacher tenure, or raise teacher salaries, a plurality continue to support reform. More broadly, there is a growing awareness in the world of education reform that the big battles over getting new teacher-evaluation laws passed or school accountability systems implemented are not the end of the story.
