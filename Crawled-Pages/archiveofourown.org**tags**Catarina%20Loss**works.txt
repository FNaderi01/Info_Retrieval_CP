    Summary
      This is going to be hard to explain. Really hard to explain. Alec is due to arrive from Buenos Aires Institute and take up the mantle of Head of the Institute and we're in a ... situation. `````````In a universe where Maryse Lightwood didn't get out of the Circle early enough, it changes a tiny little detail that has the Shadow World and all it's inhabitants living in a slightly different chain of events. Some people fall in love earlier, some fall out sooner, and some of them don't feel it at all. Some mysteries are left wholly uncovered, and other's never see the light of day. Some truths come to be shrouded in heavy curtains. But how different would it be? There's only so much one man can do after all.

    Summary
      A collection of standalone fics all in the same canon-compliant universe, inspired by Dermot Kennedy's album "Without Fear." Each chapter is based on a song in the album (13 total, excluding Giants, which was added later in 2020).Alec and Magnus navigating their relationship and the emotional ups and downs that go with that, told in alternating POVs. There's some canon-typical angst, but ultimately a collection of fics depicting soft boyfriends (to soft husbands) who love each other dearly.

    Summary
      Magnus Bane always considered himself a clever and — although his friends might now agree with this part — sane person. So, obviously, the first thought that crossed his mind when he heard his friend Clary plan to pretend they were dating was that it was madness. But, at the end of the day, it seemed like his friends were right about his lack of sanity, since he ended up accepting to be part of it. The plan was actually quite simple: make Jace Lightwood jealous.However, it turns out that Jace wouldn’t be the only Lightwood jealous of this new relationship. or: the one where Alec Lightwood doesn't know why seeing two of his friends dating bothers him so much

    Summary
      Alec Lightwood’s life in his small village is simple, his purpose straightforward: he spends his days in the nearby forest hunting for wild game, and his nights at home caring for his mother and siblings.He does not remain in the forest after dark.Then, Alec’s brother Jace is arrested. When Jace is sentenced to indentured servitude in the long-abandoned castle at the center of the forest, Alec has no choice but to present himself to serve in his brother's stead—Jace has a new mate, who would suffer greatly in his absence. Their whole family would.No one would miss Alec.At his father’s behest, Alec takes his brother’s place and, with it, a new purpose: root out the secrets hidden within the dark, crumbling castle in the woods, and use them to bring its mysterious owner, Magnus Bane, to ruin.

    Summary
      Still blindly following Clave orders, Alec infuriates Magnus and gets kicked out of the loft.  Magnus nurses his emotional wounds and Dot shows up. Lots of vodka, emotional upheaval, and recently compromised state with Azazael lead the doorway open for an unwelcome visit from one of Magnus's many uncles, A Prince of Hell, Greater Demon Samael -- with a personal agenda against Magnus and everything he holds dear.  Alec unwittingly gets caught in the middle. This doesn't bode well for either of them in the (tumultous) aftermath.Canon divergent season 2 episode 13CHAPTER 20 UPDATED
