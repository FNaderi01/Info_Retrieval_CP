    Summary
      After the rebuilding of 221B Baker Street, Sherlock and John manage to settle into a vaguely comfortable routine of domestic life. But their lifestyle has never been the most child-friendly, and so John writes up some house rules in an attempt to protect Rosie. Sherlock predictably breaks them all in his own way, apart from one.or Small slices of life from 221B as Sherlock and John try to establish some sort of family unit for Rosie, while investigating the intricacies of their own relationship which sits on the border between platonic and romantic. Also there's some background crime nonsense occurring as per usual.

    Summary
      Two Canadians, two Brits studying in Canada, and an upkeeper walk into a Mystery Shack…. and live there. Summer holidays are here, and the step-siblings, Irene Adler and Sherlock Holmes, find themselves in a boring town called Reichenbach Falls, Oregon, USA. It isn’t as boring as it seems, however, once Sherlock stumbles upon a mystery journal, and the author is unknown. The journal contains ciphers, a strange colour wheel, and information about magical creatures that are said to be looming in the Northwestern forests. With mysteries to solve in hand, he and Irene set out to get to the roots of the town, and the abrupt disappearance of the author of the journal. But they’re not alone - John Watson, quite the handsome nephew of the Mystery Shack owner Greg Lestrade, is on their side to help out, plus mess with Sherlock’s feelings, in a good way. Shenanigans, romance, fun, danger, and deductions ensue. Oh, and there’s also occasional SuperWhoLock and two dorky Winchester brothers to spark up the action later on.
DISCLAIMER - you needn't have watched Gravity Falls to understand or read this fanfiction, even though it is its AU, just enjoy! This is Season 1 of a 3-part series.

    Summary
      La primera vez que pasó fue un accidente.Tras Reichenbach, John descubre una forma de aferrarse a Sherlock después de todo.Prepárate para leer: 1) Angst; 2) Argumento; 3) Porno; 4) Más porno; 5) Aún más porno; 6) Más argumento y 7) Final feliz. Pero, según parece, en MUCHOS capítulos. Si te preocupa la violencia gráfica / tortura, ten en cuenta que está limitada al capítulo 30. Probablemente es típicamente canon, pero prefiero avisar de más que de menos.Aquí te va un extracto, sólo para darte esperanza a través de la angustia de los primeros capítulos:—Voy a seducirte, Sherlock Holmes, —murmuró en el oído de Sherlock, sonriendo cuando el aliento de Sherlock se volvió errático de nuevo— No porque lo necesites, sino porque lo mereces. Ambos lo merecemos. —Le dio un apretón a Sherlock. — ¿Confías en mí?Sherlock alzó la cabeza, esos ojos pálidos y misteriosos mirando a John con sinceridad: —Siempre confié en ti, John.John sintió el último atisbo de tensión abandonar sus hombros. —Bien. —Besó a Sherlock una vez más, rápida y suavemente; una promesa. —Eso está bien.

      Sherlock lost a bet--with his mother. Which means he has to do whatever she says. It won't be illegal, or painful, or permanent--but Sherlock is NOT going to enjoy it. 
Everyone else will, though.

    Summary
      It’s going to be the last Tour de France for professional cyclist John Watson. Despite the hardships of cycling more than 3000 kilometres in three weeks, in blistering heat and torrential rain, over dangerous cobblestones in northern France and the mountains of the Alps and the Pyrenees, battling thirst, hunger, injury and exhaustion, not to mention bitchy rivals, doping allegations, and the ever scoop-hungry press, he is going to enjoy the ride, damn it. That’s what John keeps telling himself – until he meets his new teammate, Sherlock Holmes, who adds a whole new list of problems as well as an extra dose of excitement to John’s life

      What if Sherlock told John the truth of Reichenbach? What if Mary never came into the picture? What if John realized just how much he cares for Sherlock, and did something about it? What if they adopted a little girl, as bright as Sherlock was at her age, and lived happily in 221B for 11 years?What if one day, 17-year-old Allie is kidnapped by someone they all thought was dead? (This is my first fanfic, so please be nice.

    Summary
      Ostatniego dnia stycznia 2020 roku w Wielkiej Brytanii ogłoszono pierwszym przypadek koronawirusa. Dwa miesiące później okaże się, że pierwszy przypadek był już 20 stycznia. Wobec tego, że brytyjski rząd podejmował dość kontrowersyjne działania (a raczej - nie podejmował), Mycroft zarządził sobie i jego ukochanemu Gregory’emu samoizolację. Oto jej przebieg.
