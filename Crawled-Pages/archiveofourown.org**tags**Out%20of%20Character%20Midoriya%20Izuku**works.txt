      I am so excited about this year's Whumptober Challenge! I am taking my prompt list from Wildmage. They released an  amazing  prompt list for a whump x kink 'tober which can be found on their twitter. I will only be doing the Whump portion, as writing kink is still super scary to me! Anyways.... This month is going to hurt a lot and I am ready to release my angst into the universe!

    Summary
      Midoriya Izuku struggled with constant lapses of time from his dissociation. Preferring to go on auto-pilot during the day. Preferring to be fully aware at night when he changes into his alter-ego "Jackrabbit".Going numb long ago, he's glad he could still feel a little bit when he's "Jackrabbit" though.His plans? To join UA. Vigilante turned full time and legal hero. How does that sound?A/N: please don't read if you don't like the idea of Kuugo and Izuku as a pair. I'm unsure what I want their relationship to be like, but I do plan on them getting closer later on in the story. Alongside villains though, Midoriya will most definitely have some sort of relationship with other heroes.9/11/20: I'm also sorry that the chapters fluctuate in length and have only been getting longer so far. I'll try to post every Friday from now on.

    Summary
      Three pale figures. One with green hair, one with blonde, and the last with red and white stand in a darkly lit room. They talk about something in hushed voices as if they are afraid that the wind will carry their words somewhere they do not want them to be.“So they’re supposed to be coming, right?” Green curls bounce against each other as a head cocks to the side giving the peppermint haired one a questioning glance, accusing him of a lie he has not yet told.“Of course you damn nerd!” Spikey blond hair is thrown in front of the green-haired figure and yells.Emerald eyes roll in their sockets, more sassy than angry, “Shut up Kacchan…”“Stop arguing and don’t worry, they’re supposed to arrive at some point this evening.” The one that had kept his silence up until now finally speaks his mind.

    Summary
      Izuku has strange dreams. Dreams of generators, of totems, of exit gates, and of dangerous killers. Through these dreams, Izuku discovers his quirk. It gives him strange abilities that don't make sense. Watch as Izuku attempts to use his odd and dangerous powers to become a hero while trying to discover what his dreams are about, and where his powers come from.DISCLAIMER: You do not need knowledge of the game Dead by Daylight to enjoy this fic, I will be describing everything in detail about the powers that Izuku receives. If you want to play Dead by Daylight, it is a FREE mobile game that I highly recommend.

    Summary
      Izuku is taken in for interrogation, under the belief he is the U.A. traitor. However, this is not the first time Izuku has been interrogated or falsely accused. Though he normally wasn't accused of being a *traitor* of all things. Normally it was just property destruction or on occasion, another student's injury. So he's used to this. And he's tired of it. If he can't be trusted at U.A., by his classmates, his teachers, then he might as well not be there. So he's leaving, to the shock of his classmates. He's disappointed in them. Really.

    Summary
      Izuku Midoriya was hated just because he was Quirk-less. They called him Deku, which means useless. He endured for a while but he finally lost everything. And when he gave up, hope has arrived in the form of a eternally-lost-swordsman. After three years of disappearance, he came back stronger than ever. Now he had a mission. A purpose. He was going to burn down the same system that labeled him as hopeless. He was going to be hope for some, terror for others. He was Anarchy.

    Summary
      Midoriya Izuku always had a quirk, in fact, he was one of the first in his year to get one. The problem was that it was deemed a 'Useless Quirk.'The bullying continued, at least until High School.Now Midoriya Izuku is in UA. In the Hero Course. In Class 1B.Armed with the ability to give himself any wound, any illness, and heal himself from anything his quirk does.He will shake UA.***Next Chapter Update (30/09/2020): Next chapter will be in around a fortnight, or a week, if all goes well and on schedule.***TRIGGER WARNING:This fic contains non-suicidal self-harm, due to the nature of the altpower. It will also contain descriptions of injury that some might find graphic, including descriptions of body horror. I'm not sure that it will be very triggering but decided to place the warnings, just in case.

    Summary
   Regaining his manners, Izuku nodded politely towards the newcomers, but that wasn’t enough to appease Muscular. “And who’s this runt? He looks like I could crush him with one hand.”
  Shigaraki growled, and Kurogiri continued, “Patience, Muscular. This is-”
  “Call me Phoenix,” Izuku interrupted.
  Kurogiri looked surprised at his outburst, but Dabi only smirked. “Any reason for this new nickname?”
  “I don’t see why I need to explain myself to you, Mr. I-Only-Go-By-Dabi.”
  Dabi grinned wider, but before he could snap right back, Kurogiri cut him off. “Now that introductions are finished, we should get going; nightfall is soon.” 
Memories are what defines a person. They shape our emotions, choices, outlook, and opportunities. Without them, what are you? When someone's memories are changed, do they remain the same person? (Mature rating for swearing, violence, abuse, and possible triggers)

    Summary
      "The U.A. Students will treat this exercise as a game. They expect me to play fairly of course, but the thing is. We aren't even playing the same game." Shiketsu and U.A., two schools that had created a rivalry in creating the world's greatest heroes. With the rise of the League of Villains and the All Might's retirement, the Hero Commission has ordered both schools to work together as they seek to train heroes that will stand high in a new era of discord. Joint training exercises, designed to test School doctrine and belief. But the question remains? Is U.A. ready for Shiketsu's first-year general? Blood, sweat, and tears will be spilled as secrets and truths are uncovered. With a certain green-haired teen with an obsidian coat at the center of it all.
