Disabled Veteran Creates Veterans Health Solutions, The Premiere Cannabis Education Resource For The Veteran And Underserved Communities            
				By Sentinel News Service                
	                	                Published February 28, 2018

Two weeks after Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded a trio of memos from the Obama administration that had adopted a policy of noninterference with marijuana friendly state laws, Veterans Health Solutions (VHS) is now offering real time cannabis education to colleges, veteran organizations and urban centers nationally.
VHS, a non-profit public benefit organization has setup a full comprehensive strategy to educate the veteran populace and underserved communities regarding the use of medicinal cannabis and or hemp related products.
“We have been working diligently for the last year on developing the most appropriate educational service, while preparing for the new laws and recently amended VA polices,” states Life D. Griffith, MSM and Executive Director for Veterans Health Solutions.
        ADVERTISEMENT        
Mr. Griffith is a disabled veteran who served as a combat medic for 19 years in the active and reserve components of the U.S. Army. In 2015, he left the Department of Veteran Affairs as a Legal Administration Specialist &amp; Minority Veteran Program Coordinator with the Department of Veteran Affairs in Los Angeles to concentrate on Veterans Health Solutions.
“VHS strategy is simple. We strive to be the ‘FIRST TO CARE’ by educating the veteran and underserved community hands-on about the benefits of medicinal cannabis via CBD oil especially for those who are suffering from chronic physical and mental aliments,” Griffith remarked. “Every day while working with the Veterans Administration (VA), I assisted my fellow veterans with their claims process and over time, I begin to witness the chronic pain and mental suffering that the veterans were experiencing while being treated at the VA. This led many veterans to distrust the VA, PTSD outbreaks, suicide and homelessness and the opioid crisis, which are the key issues plaguing veterans nationally and that made me decide to create Veterans Health Solutions,” he further remarked.
The combination of increased prescription drugs after military service has led to more serious chronic disabilities which veterans often can’t recover from because of the multiple drugs that are still being freely prescribed by VA doctors. These drugs are highly addictive and have been linked to more serious problems and even deaths.
Although President Trump announced there was a major opioid crisis in late 2017, and U.S. Senate and House of Representatives voted to have VA doctors recommend medical marijuana to their patients, cannabis is still considered to be a scheduled 1 drug.  VHS invites all veterans and the underserved to get involved and become more educated about cannabis.
