    “You once told me you’d probably break my heart.” She leaned against him, her forehead against the musky curve of his neck. Claire spoke into his throat, like breathing the words deep into his lungs. “Maybe this is how. But you promised you would mend it too. I’ll wait for you to make good on that vow, Fraser.”Scalpel &amp; Needle (Arc I: Incision) by @kalendraashtarread the full story here

                                I loved this fic. And others you wrote. Saudades. Keep safe. ❤️                            rummietummiesmummie reblogged this from widchadidcha and added:                                                                                                                                                                                    
                                @widchadidcha‘s reaction. Is a ditto for me as well. @kalendraashtar, I hope all is well with you and your family. I...                            luckeylass said:                                             
                                I think of your story often. I happened upon it at a time when I needed a distraction, but I found hope instead. I don’t think I ever commented on or complemented you on it, and I am ashamed I never told you how much it meant to me. It is true - and just - that selfishness always begets regret, so I want to tell you now - it was extraordinary, it was beautiful, it cut to the very heart of me. And I’ll never forget it.                            shipperofallthings liked this                                    widchadidcha reblogged this from kalendraashtar and added:
