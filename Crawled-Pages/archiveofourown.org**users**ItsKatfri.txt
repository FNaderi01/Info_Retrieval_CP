    Summary
      This is a pilot chapter of something I’m working on with my friend. Depending on how well it does, this will continue farther.**This is the prologue to what the fic will entail. Yes it’s part of it, but it’s going on while the quirk apprehension tests occur. The results of this will show in full later. The entire thing will revolve around my OC, Sora Kurono the child of Overhaul and Chronostais and Yuuki Midoriya, the child of Shigaraki and Midoriya.

    Summary
      One thing Sunstreaker always kept hidden was that he was a famous artist. It was almost his best-kept secret. His true best-kept secret was that he could see in 100 million different colours. Those were his best-kept secrets. Until they weren’t.
(Or that one universe where Sunstreaker is a tetrachromat, and it affects more things than you’d think)

    Summary
      Megatron, delirious, attempts to attack Starscream for his insolence. He doesn’t realise that, in his deliriousness, he was actually beating Soundwave. Soundwave, ever the loyal bot, doesn’t retaliate one bit. He instead chooses to try to convince Megatron that he did nothing wrong and to stop beating him. Unfortunately, the only audio clips he has that could serve that purpose were from Starscream’s voice.

  Summary
    These are pretty much stories that I post just to make sure I don’t forget them. It takes me a while to upload chapters, because my writing style changes so frequently and I’m often to busy to write anyway. I will upload, eventually, but it may take years before I can safely upload a chaoter without removing it later on that same day.
