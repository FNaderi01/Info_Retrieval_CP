    Summary
      Somehow, John Wick has found himself on his last job, in the last place on earth he'd want to be: Central Texas.   He can't give his reasons why he's so desperate to leave the organization, but before he can, he's sent on an absolutely asinine, ridiculous assignment in order to earn his freedom.  Alma Davis is back home in Lakeway, Texas, after years away, living in the oddly unique house her father built for them during his career as an architect. She's wrapping up loose ends and trying to figure out where she belongs.  With nothing tying her down to anywhere or anyone, she struggles to figure out if she should stay or go.

    Summary
      Freelance journalist and research nerd Ivy Falk is mostly content, though she could do with better jobs and more money. She's mostly happy, until she backs into a stranger sent to follow her after publishing an expose on the local criminal syndicate.  Ivy is able to see patterns in most things, and is a world-class investigator. John Wick is back in.  The High Table has fallen, and an opportunist is in charge, rebuilding the network of the underworld.  There's no services, no administration, and no order.  Frustrated that he's a glorified errand boy for Gregor Sokolov, he's sent after Ivy to shake her down, but finds himself endlessly intrigued by the bright, charming woman he's been charged with. Both have a laser focus.  Both have a dodgy past.  Both make the occasional questionable decision. But what happens when the tension is high, and emotional stakes are even higher?

    Summary
      Ben and Rey Solo have been together for thirteen years. They have three beautiful children. An amazing home. To anyone that meets them, they are nothing but a kind and loving family in the community. 
But it took a lot to get where they are. Their love was nurtured in quiet moments between international battles of violence and the feared whispers of their previous names. There is a whole side to them their children have never seen and hopefully would never have to. They took precautions.
But sometimes, the past crashes back in anyway. Sometimes you don't have a choice. 
No matter the stakes, Ben and Rey protect their children.

    Summary
      Having fallen back under the High Table's command in order to revoke his excommunicado status, the Alpha John Wick refuses to allow them to govern his sex life as well. He chooses me, a shy and overweight Omega female, in what is intended to be a mating of convenience, presumably without the High Table's knowledge.While John believes that he has won the Table's blessing, however, he discovers he is horribly wrong when, in the eighth month of my unexpected pregnancy, the Elder has me abducted and brought to his caravan in the desert. For the man who sits above the table has long desired revenge against Wick for disobeying his order to kill Winston. In his wrath, the Elder plans to let me give birth to John's child and then kill us both, an act which will destroy the assassin, who has already had to survive the loss of Helen, his first wife.As the caravan travels across the desert, I am able to communicate with my mate due to our bond; a bond that the Elder does not sever, wishing for Wick to suffer my moment of death. Now John Wick must find and rescue his yet unborn child and me, the woman he has come to love, before I go into labor and it is too late.
