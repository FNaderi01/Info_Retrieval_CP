      Dark forces have taken control of Arda and Bilbo finds himself captive in a Dwarven kingdom far from home. Sauron prepares to return Melkor from the Void for a final battle that will determine the fate of their world and fulfil the last prophecy of Mandos. Victory for the enemy seems certain with little hope that a single hobbit could change the course of history. Thorin and Bilbo must risk everything they love to save Middle-earth from destruction.

      The first thing that strikes Fili is the endless depth of those impossibly dark eyes, like two pools lost in the wilderness. “You are safe here,” he says for something to say, but it doesn’t seem to help much with the expression of a prey caught in the net.
