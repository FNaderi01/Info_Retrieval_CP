                                                            Hey can I use the prompt list for practice even if I might not finish the drawings? The ones I do finish I'll post and tag accordingly but just wanted to make sure
                                                        Totally! The prompt list can absolutely be used for personal practice, even after the event ends. Glad youâ€™re feeling inspired!-Kat
