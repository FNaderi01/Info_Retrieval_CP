memesrosietw: sexual assault.a rant poem I wrote today.Sunny little room full of brochures and patterned throw cushions  My legs cross uncomfortably and my hands are sweating and I run them through my hair like I’m adjusting a safety blanket  All grief is really rage, I say  She – seeing me sitting there like I’m melting bit by bit on the inside – nods because she knew this already  But I explain it anyway     We get angry when things are taken away from us (that’s grief over people and things)  We get mad when things don’t go the way we want (that’s the grief of expectations)  And we feel rage when our consent is violated (that’s the grief of loss of autonomy)  Lots of people I wish I could explain this to  In a nice little room full of brochures and throw cushions  Water on the side table     I get angry, say I wish I could have kicked his shins for daring to go there    My waist is so personal to me  It connects other bits I hold dear  My hips and legs  Arms and breasts  I like to hold onto it when I’m feeling insecure  But there’s this pleased expression on his face as though he’s achieved something really worth noting  I’m not fit for that, I want to say  Did he repurpose my body just so he could caress it  Do I have to recalibrate my edges from hard to soft again once this is done  See if I can cut him on the way out  My skin is crawling and I’m trying to sidle away while he slithers closer  Every shift in a person’s body is a message and I’m speaking loud and clear  So why isn’t this very obvious hint working?  Just another stupid-looking fuck in a yellow jacket  Who never learned the rules  Or knows them and doesn’t care     But that was the third time  The first time I was eleven years old, baking something in a food tech class  I felt a quick pinch on my left butt cheek and I turned to see Joseph (real name, by the way) looking too intently at the dough he was meant to be kneading  Not the dough he wasn’t meant to be kneading, but I knew in my heart and still know now that I didn’t imagine shit  I’m certain I said something that time  Something really pointed and sure of myself like “Did you just…?” or “What did you…?”  Some strange little part of me that didn’t know any better thought it was kinda cool he’d given me the attention     The second time I was twenty-seven  Left my body behind the moment he shoved his hand down the back of my trousers  Full bar, bouncers on the door, my friends just over the other side of the table  Anyone looking on might’ve thought we were a couple getting overly familiar in public  But I’d never met him before that night and I was horrified  When I came to he was still acting like he belonged, and again I wish and wish I could have done something more obvious than rip his wandering hand away and tell him to stop  Do something really nasty with that beer jug  Utilise the sharp elbows I’ve often been told I have  Grow wings, talons, pick him up and drop him in the freezing harbour  He’d be soaking wet and spluttering  Did I ask if he can swim?     He has the same name as my father and I hate him for that  Hate him for denying it ever happened  For saying it doesn’t sound like him  Hate him for going to the police station even though I asked for that  Hate him for telling them all the same bullshit he had his girlfriend tell me  My anger bangs about inside my skull and yeah, it’s fucking unfair that I can’t transform into a giant bird woman and lay waste to this entirely  Beat my wings until the air heats and shimmers and I fold myself up, dive beak-first into the harbour where I find him still floundering  And drive us both to the bottom   Make my trauma present in his life  Grow feathers around my waist  Sit in a too-bright room full of brochures and throw cushions  Water on the side table  Crying because the rage inside me has nowhere to go
