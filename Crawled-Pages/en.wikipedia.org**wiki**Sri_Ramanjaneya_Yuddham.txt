Plot[edit]
The film is based on Hindu mythology which shows Lord Hanuman's devotion towards Lord Rama. It begins Lord Rama's (N. T. Rama Rao) crowning ceremony when Anjaneya (Arja Janardhan Rao) could not be separated from Rama after the celebrations. Here Lord Siva (P. J. Sarma) praises Anjaneya's devotion towards Srirama when Goddess Parvathi (Rajasri) argues that the Power is the vital force of nature which is greater than the Devotion. Parallelly, Kaasi King Yayati (Dhulipala) a great devotee of Rama, could not attend the ceremony, but Rama praises him in the dream. Parvathi wants to test Yayati, so, she sends Maya (Suvarna) the illusion to prove that power is greater than devotion. Maya sends wild animals into the Kaasi Kingdom, Yayati kills them and shoots a weapon at Maya. Frightened, Maya turns into Matangakanya, enters Sapta Rushi Ashram and asks for a pardon of Maharshi Viswamitra (Mukkamala), by the time, the weapon kills her. Vishwamitra becomes furious, about to curse Yayati when Sage Narada (Kanta Rao) prevents and sends Yayati away. Narada tells Vishwamitra that the culprit must be punished by the emperor, so, Vishwamitra orders Rama to give the death sentence to Yayati. Distressed Rama sends Bharata (Sridhar), Yayati obeys his order and moves towards Ayodhya. Shantimati (Jayanthi), wife of Yayati along with children also starts to plead Seeta (B. Saroja Devi). Now Parvathi feels proud that she has proved Power is stronger than Devotion. But Siva creates a natural calamity in which Yayati, Bharata and Shantimati get separated. In those hurricane winds, Yayati lands up at Anjanadevi Ashram (Hemalatha) who gives him the blessing of full-fledged life. But he replies that his destiny is different then she calls her son Anjaneya when he takes a vow on Rama that he will keep up his mother's word. After knowing the truth, he collapses but decides not to leave his vow. Lord Siva rescues Shantimati, leaves her at Ayodhya and the children are taken care by Sage Vasista. Learning that, Anjaneya went against him Rama's heart breaks down. After that, Anjaneya sends Angada as an emissary to Rama but he refuses pardon unless Anjaneya releases Yayati. Meanwhile, Narada &amp; Siva explains Anjaneya if he could not keep his vow it is an insult to his Lord, so, he gets ready for war. Eventually, Rama also moves to the battlefield where he encounters Anjaneya. After some arguments, Rama uses his arrow Ramabanam and Anjaneya his devotional chanting Sriramanamam which collude with each other and leads to universal destruction. Meanwhile, Shantimati seriously prays to Goddess Parvathi, to which she melts and understands that devotion is greater than power. Ultimately, Lord Siva &amp; Parvathi appear, stop the battle by saying that all these was an illusion to prove the Power of Devotion when Viswamitra also forgives Yayati. Finally, Lord Siva says that Srirama's chanting &amp; Srirama's arrow will revolve around the universe to protect the wise and destroy the evil.
