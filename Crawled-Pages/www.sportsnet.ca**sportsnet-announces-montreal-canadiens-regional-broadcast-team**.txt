– David Amber joins NHL on Sportsnet team as host and reporter –
– Sportsnet to deliver all 82 Montreal Canadiens games this season –
TORONTO (October 2, 2014) Hot on the heels of its new 3-year English-language regional broadcast deal with the Montreal Canadiens, Sportsnet today announced the broadcast team that will help to deliver every play, every save, and every goal of every period of every Habs game this season.
Play-by-play announcer John Bartlett, host and reporter Chantal Desjardins and analyst Jason York join Sportsnet’s all-star NHL broadcast team, and will be the team that delivers 42 regional Montreal Canadiens telecasts this season – 39 on Sportsnet East and three on City Montreal. The remaining 40 Canadiens games will air nationally this season across CBC, Sportsnet, and City, bringing fans coverage of all 82 Habs games this season. All Habs games will also be available on Rogers NHL GameCentre LIVE.
Additionally, David Amber joins the NHL on Sportsnet as host of select Montreal Canadiens national games, host of Edmonton Oilers regional games and a rinkside reporter for national games.
More on the newest additions to the NHL on Sportsnet broadcast team:
David Amber, Host and Rinkside Reporter – Fan-favourite Amber brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to Sportsnet, previously working as a host and reporter on Hockey Night in Canada, NBA TV Canada, NHL Network, and ESPN.
John Bartlett, Play-by-Play – Joins the Sportsnet team after three years of calling the play-by-play for the Canadiens on English radio broadcasts in Montreal. Prior to that, Bartlett spent six years as a broadcaster for the AHL’s Toronto Marlies. 
Chantal Desjardins, Rinkside Reporter and Studio Host – Desjardins joins Sportsnet following a successful radio and television broadcast career in Montreal, including anchoring sports and entertainment news for CTV Montreal, co-hosting the CHOM-FM morning show, and anchoring sports news on CJAD.
Jason York, Analyst – The former NHL defenceman posted 229 points in his 13-year career, playing with the Detroit Red Wings, Anaheim Ducks, Ottawa Senators, Nashville Predators, and Boston Bruins. York previously appeared on Sportsnet as an analyst for Ottawa Senators’ regional broadcasts and as a sports radio host in Ottawa. York has also contributed as a columnist to the Ottawa Sun.
The Habs regular season broadcast schedule kicks off Wednesday, Oct. 8 at 7 p.m. ET nationally on Sportsnet as the Canadiens pay a visit to Toronto to renew the oldest rivalry in the NHL on opening night of the NHL regular season. Sportsnet’s Montreal Canadiens regional television broadcast schedule begins on Monday, Oct. 13 at 7:30 p.m. ET on City Montreal as the Habs visit the Tampa Bay Lightning.
