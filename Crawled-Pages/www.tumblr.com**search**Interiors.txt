Vintage interior design: a gallery.That’s the fun thing about Pinterest, isn’t it. You catch one of these and you immediately stumble upon a colony. I saw someone had pinned some of these on a board called “James Bond Home Design”. I can get behind that. (Image 9 is from 1955, the rest is 1960s/1970s.)

2I’ve said this before but: I love this kind of summer-autumn morning light. It is especially good on a Sunday morning when there’s nothing to do but drink coffee, read a good book, make plans or cancel them all to lie on the rug and listen to music and watch the dust in it.

2The weekend. Same as any other day now really, with less work. With all the time in the flat I’m trying to do the things I’ve wanted to do but been putting off: I’m propagating tomatoes and herbs, sorting through these old copies of LRB and other magazines and papers, I’m going to complete that half-finished human rights law short course, tidy my kitchen cupboards and make pasta with the 00 flour that is still sat in a jar. All good time-filling things. But it’s also enough to just sit in the sun for an hour with a beer and a book, isn’t it
