                 Mini Bio
                WHO AM I?I’m a writer and vidder, a lifelong media fan, and a long-time member of the fannish community. I love tech and tech-y toys, enjoy the challenge of learning new things, and am always striving to be a better writer, a better vidder, and a better human being. I believe in IDIC, in living and letting live, and in freedom of expression. I have my share of pet peeves, but I try to vent in private because I don’t believe in pissing in other peoples’ cornflakes.I have a website (www.montanaharper.com). All my fiction is posted there and linked to from LJ, though as soon as DW is in open beta I'll be here exclusively. All works on this site by Montana Harper are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 United States License.WHAT AM I DOING IN THIS HANDBASKET?That's a question I've been asking myself ever since I fell headlong into Supernatural fandom. I'll let you know if I stumble across an answer, okay?This journal welcomes mature discussion on a variety of topics, and as such may not be suitable for minors.
