    Summary
      Los rumores se extendieron rápidamente por el palacio, la noticia de lo sucedido estaba en boca de todos.
—¿Has oído?
—¿Escuchaste?
—Nunca creerás lo que pasó ...
—¿Te dijeron lo que hizo el príncipe heredero esta mañana en el cuartel?
Hubo jadeos y risitas. Exclamaciones de negación y luego alegre asombro cuando se confirmó.
—Es lo que sucede cuando dejas que los omegas hagan lo que no deberían –dijo un omega de cabello gris con un sucinto asentimiento de cabeza–. No sé qué estaba pensando ese alfa escocés al dejar que el príncipe heredero entrenara con espadas. Nunca había escuchado algo tan tonto.

      Dr John Hamish Watson lay dying on a forgotten battlefield in Afghanistan, until the moon rose, revealing a werewolf picking through the corpses. It turned him,  and the virus it gave him healed the gaping bullet wound in his leg, but now he had a problem. He returned home to London, a full Were, and in desperate need of a better flat.Enter Sherlock Holmes, a Were being killed by his wolf, whose scent makes John's wolf howl inside him. Can he help his new attractive friend, before Sherlock's virus kills him? Could falling in love be the thing that saves them both?
