June WritingJun. 30th, 2019 09:11 am
I thought I'd go over my writing news for June and see how I did. In June, I:- started the silent film book but more or less instantly bailed on it in favor of a Little Red Riding Hood retelling; may go back to the silent film book once I’ve done more research- finished the Little Red Riding Hood retelling, and never mind the fact that I’ve probably done less research about pre-Revolutionary Russia than I have about silent film- actually, there’s totally a female silent film director in this book, who makes a film riffing on “Little Red Riding Hood” starring the heroine and her pet wolf (who is definitely a former anarchist whose companions transformed her into a wolf when she suggested maybe using black magic to overthrow the tsar might have unfortunate unintended consequences)- (I strongly suspect that this book has an audience of like five people. Such is life.)- did not complete or even begin revisions of the Goblin Market retelling, but I’ve decided that would be a good story for a Halloween release anyway so I’m not too fussed. My final June goal was “come up with a solid idea (plot/characters) for an m/m book. It's probably a little too on the nose if I write one about a sulky Soviet assassin, isn't it?” And it doesn’t feature a sulky Soviet assassin! There’s a sulky Soviet spy instead. But this is more relevant to my July goals so I will post about that tomorrow.
