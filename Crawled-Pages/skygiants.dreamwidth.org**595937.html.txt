skygiantsOver the course of time when I was doing costume polls, several people politely asked me a.) what Hotel Del Luna is actually about andb.) is it goodThe answer to b.) is ... yes? I think it's yes! Like I know that I enjoyed it a tremendous about but also I think it is genuinely really very good; I found it not just a visual fashion feast but consistently surprising in really endearing ways. As for a.) .... yes, I'm sorry, it is time for another picspam.So the actual plot of Hotel del Luna is roughly as follows: once upon a time, bandit leader Jang Man Wol reached a point of peak murderous despair, killed a whole lot of people, and was sentenced by God to remain in eternal supernatural stasis managing a ghost hotel.(The woman whose throat she's holding a sword to is God, by the way. She shows up a fair amount.)Over the next several hundred years, Jang Man Wol changed her fashion sense, became a really ardent foodie, and acquired several loyal ghost employees, but did not make a single jot of emotional progress until a confused man wandered into her hotel and picked a leaf off her magic tree and she promptly pulled a full Beauty and the Beast and got him to promise her the right to his son's labor as ghost hotel manager twenty years later ... an investment plan!(The money did let little Gu Chan Seong get a full Harvard degree in hotel management, so honestly like ... as indentured servitude goes ... not that different from US public service loans ....)Anyway, when Jang Man Wol turns up again twenty years later, our hero Gu Chan Seong is not initially thrilled. However, armed with a new ability to see ghosts and a lot of genuinely extremely good Harvard-trained customer service skills, Gu Chan Seong soon becomes really invested in his mandate to help stressed-out ghosts have a nice and relaxing five-star vacation at Hotel del Luna before proceeding to the afterlife. Of course, as far as helping people move on to the afterlife goes, the final boss is ruthless, amoral, immensely powerful Jang Man Wol herself ... Gu Chan Seong has a strategy! His strategy is to aggresively damsel himself until she gets distracted from whatever morally bankrupt thing she was planning on doing that day and has to rescue him instead.To be clear: he never levels up. Jang Man Wol remains an enormously powerful supernatural being and Gu Chan Seong continues to be a sweet dude who's really good at hotel management and giving Jang Man Wol earnest Bambi eyes. I feel the need to specify this because it's such a complete swap of the usual gendered power dynamics in kdrama and it makes me very happy! I also love the rest of the cast ... my favorite is the murdered teen girl ghost who has possessed the body of her murderer, and is now really motivated to get justice for other murderees. This concept is so good that I honestly might steal it for my next D&amp;D character.The dude with her here, by the way, is also a ghost -- he's the hotel bellboy, who died tragically during the Korean war. They're very cute!Here are the other two hotel employees, who are both from different parts of the Joseon era.You may remember Room Manager Choi from her fabulous black widow outfit and she is also very dearly beloved, by me, and also by Jang Man Wol. They're vengeance buddies!Meanwhile, among the living, Gu Chan Seong has a very sweet roommate named Sanchez. I love their dynamic ... it is supportive, but also realistic!Sanchez does his best, but it takes him a little while to get used to the fact that his life is now approximately 1000% more filled with ghosts than it was before his roommate's new job and sometimes they come to crash at his house. Shout-out to the Grim Reaper, btw. A very chill coworker when he's not destroying errant and unrepentant souls out of the cycle of reincarnation. Let me be clear, though: the show has many hijinks and is often extremely funny, but it's also very much an exploration of loss, death, and grief. Rough to be a ghost! Rough to be a living human who's deeply attached to a ghost! One last thing that I truly and deeply love about the premise that is kind of a spoiler: you know I love a reincarnation story, and Hotel del Luna does have some reincarnation in it, but a thing I didn't even know I wanted until I got it was a reincarnation story where romance is very pointedly not the reincarnation? Jang Man Wol had an intense relationship in the past, and it's teased that Gu Chan Seong might be that guy, but in fact that is eventually comprehensively disproven: he is a totally new guy!!! You can move on from your tragic destiny and forge a relationship that's completely new! And as much as I love Chicago Typewriter, which is also about moving on from your tragic past, I deeply love introducing the premise of a past-life love interest and then going 'nah though.' Sometimes when you kill a guy you actually probably shouldn't get back together with him, and that's fine.

That last bit about the premise sounds very cool. I won't watch this show, for reasons, but I've enjoyed reading bits about it--and that last bit is frankly awesome.

Kdramas have been really helpful recently in helping me formulate what I do and don't find appealing about reincarnation stories; the long version is I am not super interested in tragic destiny but I am extremely enthusiastic about reincarnation as a representation of the way that people can learn from the past and grow and change beyond it!

*nods* I am definitely here for stories that explore growth/change instead of just dropping it in by fiat.

One element of the reincarnation plot in this I was unexpectedly happy to see was it not following the "modern reincarnation of evil past character is also evil in the present". Mira likes to mooch off people, but it's clear she's a different person from Princess Song-hwa. (Though I'm forever lol-ing at Mago deciding to ship her and Yeon-woo together in the present)

Great writeup! I'm so glad you liked this show and decided to do the costume polls. I also find it hard to say, objectively, whether this show is actually amazing or it simply hit so many of my narrative kinks that I don't care. Do I think the episodes could have been trimmed down to an hour each and have been much tighter? Oh yeah. But when you give me gender reversed Beauty and the Beast + cold amoral heroine with soft warm-hearted hero +multiple powerful/important women interacting with each other AND throw in IU strutting around in those fabulous outfits, I really don't mind.To be clear: he never levels up. Jang Man Wol remains an enormously powerful supernatural being and Gu Chan Seong continues to be a sweet dude who's really good at hotel management and giving Jang Man Wol earnest Bambi eyes. I feel the need to specify this because it's such a complete swap of the usual gendered power dynamics in kdrama and it makes me very happy!  yess this. I kept on expecting Gu Chan-seong to "become stronger" via some sort of magical power and it just never happened!... my favorite is the murdered teen girl ghost who has possessed the body of her murderer, and is now really motivated to get justice for other murderees.I would watch a whole sequel show about her!I've mentioned this to you before, but I really liked what this show did with its past life and reincarnation storylines. The past life stuff were interesting enough to be its own separate sageuk drama, but Man-wol's platonic love for Yeon-woo is shown to be just as important as her tragic romance with Chung-myung. And this is one of the incredibly rare asian dramas I've seen that went "heady intense tragic first love is great but you know what's better? a mature second love based on communication and mutual respect."On a less happy note, it looks like they're going to make a US remake of this show: https://www.tor.com/2020/06/24/fantasy-k-drama-series-hotel-del-luna-is-getting-a-remake-from-altered-carbon-showrunner-alison-schapker/ ...I'm honestly not very hopeful about this.

Honestly the thing that I liked least about the ending was the fact that she decides to take the potion and not see ghosts anymore -- like, OK, good for her, I hope she enjoys a ghost-free college, but I wanted that imaginary sequel show!Yeah, I loved Jang Man Wol and Yeon Woo! And I honestly think that her relationship with Gu Chan Seong is one of the best-developed romances I've seen in a kdrama ... they actually look like they're having so much fun on their foodie dates! Like, the relationship felt real and lived-in and like something that made them happy, which is startlingly rare. ... US ..... remake??? This is NOT something I expected to hear and I feel like I need help reacting to it.

This is NOT something I expected to hear and I feel like I need help reacting to it.My reaction was: on one hand, too early to judge, otoh, all the things I love about this show are also all the things I absolutely do *not* trust an American remake to retain. And how are they going to keep certain very important reincarnation related portions of the plot if they take out all the Korean mythology-relevant bits?

I feel like watching the show could not be as much fun as reading your writeups of it ;) But I am keeping it in mind!(also a small part of me is going, why did he go to HARVARD to learn hotel management when everybody knows CORNELL is where it's at, but somehow I don't think that's the problem here.)

as;dlkjfdklit's true, the show has many virtues but I can't say it has GRIPPING realism in its depiction of American hotel management educational institutions. I did really enjoy the flashback to Gu Chan Seong's college years in which he brings a gun to a bar, in Boston, in order to make a point, and not a single person bats an eye ... America!

(The woman whose throat she's holding a sword to is God, by the way. She shows up a fair amount.)Did we get to vote for the outfit she's wearing while holding a sword to God's throat? I like it.Jang Man Wol remains an enormously powerful supernatural being and Gu Chan Seong continues to be a sweet dude who's really good at hotel management and giving Jang Man Wol earnest Bambi eyes.That's really nice.Rough to be a ghost! Rough to be a living human who's deeply attached to a ghost!GOD DAMN IT YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED WITH CRASH LANDING ON YOU.You can move on from your tragic destiny and forge a relationship that's completely new!I like this moral also!

Sixteen episodes! The episodes are long but the drama itself is short, relatively speaking. :D

Okay, you've got me. Will definitely be watching this one soon. I was reluctant because of past difficulties with the Hong sisters (their humor is too broad for my tastes and sometimes I think about Big and I just shudder), but this sounds super enjoyable, I love IU, I love stories where God is an actual character, I love gender reversal, I love good clothes, I love ghost stories...yeah, it sounds like I should check it out. Thank you for the enjoyable writeup!

For the record, I've seen a bunch of past Hong Sisters stuff and it definitely feels like they're on a new level with this one -- fantastic gender reversal, came the closest to sticking the landing of any of theirs I've seen, and I don't know who gently talked them down from the toilet humor ledge this time but thank goodness for that person, whoever they were, because somehow there isn't any?! I WAS SHOCKED.

I really liked this drama, but I don’t know that I would ever watch it again because I straight-up sobbed through the last 2 episodes and I don’t know if I could handle that again.  Also, the only reason I kept plowing through early episodes was because I appreciated the revise-Goblin/Hwayugi dynamic and because of IU’s outfits — otherwise I am way too much of a wimp and unable to handle scary scenes to have stuck through all the ghost scenes.  But I really appreciated and looked forward to your costume polls every week!  I usually lurk so don’t know if I’ve mentioned this before but I really appreciate your reviews.  I definitely add a lot to my to-read and to-watch lists based on your reviews, but it’s also fun when it’s something I’ve read/seen before!

I enjoyed the costume polls and yesterday discovered that Hotel Del Luna is on Netflix.  Being that is 36C outside today, watching Hotel Del Luna sounds like an excellent way to spend my time hiding from the burning daystar.  Plus, the costumes are glorious but you had me at it is a show about hotel management.(I should perhaps say that I came here via being referred to your book reviews, which are excellent.)
