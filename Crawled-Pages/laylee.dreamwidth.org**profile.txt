                 Mini Bio
                Full-time worker bee and part-time fangirl. Or is that full time fangirl and part-time worker bee? Sometimes it's hard to tell. I occasionally write fanfic and this journal will sometimes contain adult content. New friends are always welcome. No need to ask, just friend away!
