            The SW archive
            Socialist Worker was the publication of the International Socialist Organization (U.S.) from the group’s founding in April 1977 until its dissolution in 2019. Though SW has stopped publishing, its website dating back to 2001 is a rich source of socialist analysis and news of the working-class movement. 
Socialist Worker was published and distributed nationally in newspaper form throughout its 42-year history, as a monthly, biweekly and weekly at various times. SW’s website was launched in 2001 and began publishing daily starting in May 2008, becoming a significant voice among independent media.

        The charter school charade
            At a fancy gala thrown by the Harlem Success Academy, I heard charter school supporters use the legacy of civil rights struggles to sell privatization.

        A tale of two cities
            There are two Seattles--one for the wealthy few and another for the vast majority of people who barely scrape by, and sometimes not even that.
      Editorial
        The real animals are in the White House
            Trump’s anti-immigrant hate is disgusting — but it’s beyond sobering that his actual immigration policies are so easily confused with Barack Obama’s.

        Driven to death by Uber
            Worsening conditions for New York City taxi drivers have led to five suicides in the past year — but drivers are standing up to demand change.

        How the spark became a flame in West Virginia

      Interview: Enrique “Kike” Balcazar and Zully Palacios
        ICE came for us and the community stood up
            Two migrant labor activists detained by ICE describe how Trump is carrying out a political attack on the leaders of the immigrant struggle.
            The Politics of International Socialism
            Here are some projects that carry on the politics that Socialist Worker tried to promote:
 Socialism: Four days of political discussion, learning and organizing held every summer to bring together the left from around the U.S.
 Haymarket Books: A radical, independent publisher with hundreds of titles covering a vast range of subjects.
            SW and the ISO
            In 2019, the ISO suffered a severe crisis when information surfaced about a shamefully mishandled allegation of a sexual assault by a member several years before. After a period of reflection and discussion, nearly 500 members and recently resigned former members voted to dissolve the organization and stop publishing its newspaper. You can find the series of reflections on the crisis here.
