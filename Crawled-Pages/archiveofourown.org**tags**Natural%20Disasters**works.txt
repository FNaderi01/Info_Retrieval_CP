    Summary
      "They were in Brightmoon. They were at the epicenter of the disaster that was going to bring an end to life on Earth as they knew it. The only one who could possibly get out of this alive was Catra, having security clearance M-299 due to her degree, and it was clear by the broadcast that individuals without this clearance were not permitted on board an escape craft."At the end of the world, if you could only save yourself, would you? Or would you spend your last 24 hours making sure your family knew how much you loved them?

    Summary
      It was a normal fight, this time on the side of a volcano, until both Rodimus Prime and Galvatron fell and got blocked in a cave. With the rock all around them unstable to high power and plasma, and buried deep they are forced to wait. But patience never comes easy to Galvatron, especially in confinement. So Rodimus is left having to think fast so that there will be anything left of either of them to rescue.

    Summary
      Whumptober 2020 prompts.  I tagged most of the prompts I used but you can visit the tumblr for the full list (I did not use all of them)I'm not sure how to explain/tag this so I'll just say Link and Ghirahim do like each other, the bad things are happening to both of them (not just Ghirahim hurting Link), there's no dub con and it's not one-sided. But it is still whump, heed the tags.

    Summary
  "You got off easy. You should have seen Air Temple Island after Tenzin broke up with me."
Faced with the awkward prospect of a second (and possibly worse) break-up with Korra in the aftermath of Harmonic Convergence, Mako certainly doesn't have the guts to ask his boss or Tenzin about what exactly happened when their relationship fell apart. So instead he seeks out two mostly reliable sources—namely, Tenzin's irreverent siblings—and, in the process, ends up gaining an unexpected amount of insight into his chief.

    Summary
      Class 1-A goes up in the mountains to do wilderness and rescue training months after the events of the disastrous training camp. Bakugou has slowly but surely been working through his own issues, thanks to the help of his red headed best friend. They're determined to have the best time they can today, and nothing was going to stop them! ... right?

    Summary
      The boys are performing a string of shows in Japan when, one night, disaster strikes. An 8.5 magnitude earthquake, followed by a devastating tsunami.  In the wake of the aftermath, it's discovered that Jimin is missing and the emotional turmoil of his disappearance is almost more than the surviving members can take. Jimin is eventually found but his memory has evaded him, a frustrating addition to their already harrowing ordeal.As the members help Jimin through therapy and rehab, his memories do slowly come back to him but they aren't the kind that are meant to be shared. In a world where nothing makes sense to him anymore, the only things Jimin can remember are the very secrets that could cause yet another disaster.
