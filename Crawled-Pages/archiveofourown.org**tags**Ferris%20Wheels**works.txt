    Summary
      What does a grief counselor do when she's become a guidance counselor in a school setting? That's Rose Nylund's rhetorical question once she knew that the counseling center she works at eventually shuts down for God knows what. Though, the school she got placed at is the same school that Dorothy Zbornak substitutes in and, frequently, sends her students to the guidance office just to teach them a lesson.
With no other choice, it's time for Rose to take such matters into her own hands.

    Summary
      “You know, Will, actually… that reminds me -  the other day I saw this huge McDonald’s billboard and it immediately made me think of you.”“Huh...why? Oh, lemme guess, is it because I’m salty?”“Well, obviously. But also… also because- right next to the massive picture of the fries was the caption. And do you know what it said? Tall, blond and gorgeous. Just… just like you, sunshine.”AKA the theme park AU that no one asked for but didn’t know you needed until now, honestly the tags do a better job of describing this fic than whatever's in this box Basically solangelo trash because (to quote antisocial-slytherin-penguin on Tumblr) ‘anyways i would die for nico di angelo’s emo ass and his dumbass doctor boyfriend’(APA 6th ed: Antisocial Slytherin Penguin (2020, July 3).anyways i would die for nico di angelo’s emo ass and… [Tumblr post].

    Summary
      Working at an amusement park may seem like fun and games, but when you're stuck with your coworker Bakugou Katsuki, things may or may not be amusing—to say the least. With the way the two of you sling insults back and forth, your fellow coworkers have nicknamed the two of you 'love birds', a nickname Bakugou is quick to shut down every time it's brought up. On the other hand, maybe you wish the title were true, but you'd never tell him that. Or maybe you will.
