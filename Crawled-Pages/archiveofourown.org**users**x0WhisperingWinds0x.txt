    Summary
      She had rehearsed it to perfection."Hello... I am your new professor. My name is Byleth... Byleth Eisner. It is... a pleasure to make your acquaintance."But the silence made her wonder if she did the proper thing. She looked to the house leader in the crowd, hoping they’d help her determine the atmosphere to her greeting, but she was only met with the same astonishment etched into the faces of many others. Within the depths of her mind, she heard the girl chuckle."My my my... this is going to be quite amusing."

    Summary
      "You said you were the Avatar!" "...I lied?" Aang doesn't get rescued from Zuko's ship, and no one's seen him go glowy yet... so he starts bluffing. Hard. Or: "The Avatar joins Zuko's quest to find the Avatar." In which Zuko doesn't join the Gaang, the Gaang joins Zuko.
