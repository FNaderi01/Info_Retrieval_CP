									Commentary: The 3 steps of co-creating an agenda with parents to achieve powerful, enduring change in education systems
										Who owns the agenda for education change? It is not uncommon (and in fact it is encouraging) to hear education reformers proclaim: “We need to see parents exercise their power on education to achieve ‘X’!” But ‘X’ is often the agenda the speaker has — with good intentions — set.

									‘Exorbitant’ fees for a ‘dearth’ of special education services — An LA school may lose its charter for fighting back against LAUSD policies
										An independent charter school says LA Unified charges too much for special education services and offers too little, so it wants to hold onto the option to get those services elsewhere.

									One of LA’s first inner-city charter schools celebrates 20 years — and is proud to keep ‘Watts’ in its name
										*UPDATED When Gene Fisher opened an independent public charter school in September 1997 in Watts, it shared a one-room bungalow in a housing project with the Urban League State Preschool.

									The trailblazers: Of the first 40 charter schools in LAUSD, half are still open
										California school districts started authorizing independent charter schools in 1993. The reformers who created them were inspired to try a different model of public education — one they believed had the potential to better serve disadvantaged, low-income students who were disproportionately stuck in lower-performing schools. Public charter schools were granted flexibilities to have a longer...
