    Summary
      Harry was failed. Harry was neglected. Harry was forgotten. The sad part about all this is that he knew all this; He knew he was failed, neglected and forgotten. So he ran, and when he stopped he became loved, cherished and remembered.  This is Harry's story of how he became 'Hadrian Cepheus Lestrange'.

    Summary
      He’s not – 
He’s not jealous.
Right?
He can’t be – because that simply wouldn’t make sense. He has nothing to be jealous of. Yes, Taehyung and Yoongi hugged, onstage, multiple times, and yes, Taehyung squeezed Yoongi so hard he lifted him off his feet, and yes, Yoongi didn’t say it back when Jeongguk told him he loved him – twice – and, yes, Taehyung had been in Yoongi’s room this morning when both of them were awake, seeing as Yoongi emerged straight after Taehyung did, but – 
Oh God. Oh no. Oh no, oh fuck, shit, oh God, oh no ohnoohnonononono – 
He’s fucking jealous.
Or,
Jeongguk gets jealous of taegi

    Summary
      Jungkook has been feeling a little insecure about getting older and still having such little kissing experience. He turns to Hoseok, and his hyung is totally willing to offer him some help -- help that starts out innocently enough.-"I’m always willing to pass my years of sacred knowledge down to the younger generation."Jungkook smiles, slyly. “I mean, didn’t you have like, one girlfriend?”“Do you want me to help you or not, brat? Because I can just go to sleep.”
