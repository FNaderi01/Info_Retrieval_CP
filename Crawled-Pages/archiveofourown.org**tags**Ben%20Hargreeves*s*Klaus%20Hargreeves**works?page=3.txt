    Summary
      Three major things have changed.One, no apocalypse for now. Two, they were flung back to the 1960s. And three, somehow Ben became more corporeal than a ghost should be.Admittedly, the apocalypse is not a good time for some thorough exploration of what that truly implies - but the 1960s might as well be. Klaus wants to know how far exactly can Ben go.

    Summary
      Klaus had grown into quite a strange man over the years. After escaping the mausoleum one dreadful ‘training' night, he ran and never looked back, leaving behind all the insecurities and fears he had concerning his family. The only part of the academy he refused to leave behind was Ben, who had been lingering around since his gruesome death after Klaus had mistakenly summoned him.________________Or an AU where there is no apocalypse and no one deals with Reginald anymore. Just adults who had traumatizing childhoods that grew up into damaged adults.

    Summary
      The night of Ben’s death, Klaus went to bed late. He'd snuck into dad’s liquor cabinet and helped himself to a few cups (more than a few) of whatever was closest at hand that seemed likely to make his sleep long and without dreams. When he fell asleep, everything was soft and spinning. When he woke up, the world stopped spinning on its axis entirely, or it felt like that to him. Because this was the night he first saw Ben.

    Summary
      Dying of a non-preventable disease (there was a cure, but he wasn’t even willing to consider forgetting Klaus. Not to mention the awkward conversations that’d start), that was all well and good. But when the disease was Hanahaki, and when the object of your undying (literally) love who eponymously did not return said love, at least in the very romantic way Ben ached for, can talk to the dead...things get a bit more sludgy.

    Summary
      “And you’re sure that’s okay?”“I mean, yeah. It’s fine with me. All we have to do is ask Diego.” “And you think he’ll be...cool with it?”“Dunno.” Klaus shrugs and stirs his smoothie with his straw. “But I’m on board with it, and he usually gets on board with whatever I’m on board with, so. I’d say it’s at least worth an ask.”Klaus feels Ben’s eyes burning into him as he sips his beverage. Sure, the idea of Ben possessing him had initially been about as appealing as a coffee enema, and the first few times in practice had been more than slightly traumatizing. But once they’d established ground rules and worked to get more in tune with one another, Klaus had come to find the experience to be...interesting. It could be pleasant, almost zen—there is no sensation in the world quite like being a passenger in one's own body. And to be privy to both his own sensations as well as Ben’s? Well, that’s something else entirely.Which is why the idea of Ben possessing his body during sex both freaks him out and turns him on in equal measure.

    Summary
      “You think you know me,” Klaus said, breathless and shaky, lacking his usual bravado. The flush had crept up his neck to his cheeks and into the whites of his eyes, for now they were pink. In contrast beads of sweat rolled down the sides of his face and pooled in the dip at the base of his throat. He turned his head sideways to avoid Ben’s eyes. “You know shit, Ben. If you really knew me, you’d know me to be a freak that gets a raging hard-on because his very dead, very juvenile brother is pinning him against the bed.”Set pre-season 2.
