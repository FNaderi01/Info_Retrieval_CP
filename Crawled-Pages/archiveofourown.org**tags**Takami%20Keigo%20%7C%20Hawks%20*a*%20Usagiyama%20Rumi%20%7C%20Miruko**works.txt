    Summary
      “Look at you…” He said those words with malice, his eyes heavy with lust and mischief. He ate her up with his eyes but did nothing to touch her, just watched her as he palmed himself, getting increasingly harder and wetter.
“Ah fuck… We’re supposed to save the goods for the vlog… Damn…” He stopped his hand and turned his back to her, moving to the camera that was set up, turning it on.

    Summary
      Midnight glared at Bakugou.“Why,” she started, “did Miruko call me at three am last night to yell at me for ‘telling her son that he’s adopted’.”She slammed her hands on the table in front of her.“And why,” she continued, “did Aizawa Shouta tell me this morning that he was glad that he and Miruko made Ms. Joke your godmother and not me?”Bakugou smirked. “Don’t worry, you’re Shinsou’s godmother. Miruko is Tokoyami’s though.”Shinsou fell out of his chair.Bakugou shrugged. “It’s weird that my godfather was turned into Kurogiri, but I went to visit him, and he’s just stressed over his dumbass villainous children. Having Present Mic for a stepdad is weirder.”Tokoyami snickered from behind Sero. “I’m not sure where you’ve been if you didn’t even know you’re Shinsou’s godmother. Honestly, it’s like you’re not even a part of this family.”Midnight slammed her head onto her desk and screamed.(Or: I meant to just write Miruko accidentally acquiring Bakugou for an intern, but now she and Aizawa are acting like they adopted Bakugou years ago in an elaborate scheme and they’re denying any evidence otherwise.)

    Summary
      Rumi should have been worrying about getting a date or studying for the UA entrance exam. Unfortunately, Hawks was so persuasive that she found herself beating a wannabe hero half to death in the basement of a bar. All to amuse the League of Villains. Izuku and Katsuki would kill her, if they could find her. She'd been legally declared missing for a reason. (Teen Rumi)

    Summary
      PlusA big, angry, pink plus sign.It is so… bright… so distinct and sharp. There is no possible way a test could be more positive.PositiveThe test is positive.Very much, very properly positive.There is no mistaking it.Hawks stares at the plus sign while he feels his world crumbling around him. His eyes feel like they are about to pop out of his head. His breathing is non-existent, there is a ringing in his ears. All that exists is the rushing of his own blood, his painfully beating heart and… and… that cursed plus sign.“Shit.” Or: Hawks started sleeping with a certain villain to gain intel for the commission. What he did not expect was the baby that comes with it. PLEASE LOOK AT THE TAGS! Some chapters have trigger warnings.

But maybe, just maybe, love wasn't such a bad thing after all, and before he had even knew, he had fallen, and there was no way for him to pick himself back up again. All that was left for him to do. . . was choose.

Never again would they be given the highest honors of being called human.Should they demand changes, they would disappear.Keigo is one of the few who remembers his name, and those who fell before him. Though no one has ever made it outside the facilities alive, he knows he has to try for the friends and loved ones who lost their lives.Until rumors of his plans got out...

    Summary
      We leave our stories everywhere we go--from the people we've met to the notes we've passed, from the memories of our closest friends to the records hidden away in secret archives. Our stories still exist somewhere, no matter who has tried to hide them, or how.The Hero known as Hawks was no exception. You just have to know where to look. After all, it's a lot longer of a story than the official Billboard bios would have you believe.

      “That is a baby.”“Astute observation, Dabi. However could you tell?”“Why do you have a baby?”“That is the million-yen question, isn´t it?”“…”“It´s complicated.”Which was how Dabi learned that sleep was important, and you should never go on any important missions without having obtained it, like a certain Bird was prone to doing. Or: Hawks acquires a daughter by somewhat questionable means.

    Summary
      The date… that’s… He drops the night light and plunges the room into darkness aside from the blinding white from the phone. He can barely feel the burn of the light as he taps away at the screen, looking for evidence. Evidence that his budding theory is bullshit. It’s no good. He finds nothing to rule out his hypothesis. He stands from his floor, takes the nightlight, therefore illuminating the room in a soft, golden glow again, and walks over to his closet. He throws the door open and lets in a shuddery breath. It’s his middle school uniform. He’s gone back in time. To four months before the entrance exams.  (Leave a comment if you want to turn this into a podfic or if you want to translate it into a different language.)

    Summary
      Edward Elric was given a choice. Naturally, this can only lead to traumatizing childhoods, breaking as many laws at once as possible &amp; then some more, government conspiracies, swearing, child soldiers, gratuitous amounts of science, and some good old blasphemy. AKA Katsuki Bakugou is Edward Elric reincarnated and everyone is along for the ride. If the ride was a crashing train going off a cliff, on fire, and God was laughing.

    Summary
      “You will be better, Hawks.”
“I’ll be better,” he gasps. “I’ll be better, I’ll be the best. I’ll—I’ll do anything!” He keeps writhing, can’t seem to stop. “I’ll kill anyone, I’ll defeat anyone, I’ll bring in the League, I’ll cover up anything, I’ll do the honeypot missions, I’ll—I’ll—just don’t hurt him, not him, not my intern, please—“
Or: Hawks seems to think he's doing fine. The Commission believes otherwise.
