    Summary
      Alastor had fucked up… badly, and now was trapped inside his own mic staff, luckily his entrapment doesn’t last long, unluckily the one who ‘frees’ him is a child. 
At least the child is a wizard, maybe he could still get some… fun out of this situation.

    Summary
      At six years old, Harry Potter knew many things. He could recite the alphabet, and count to fifty without any help. He ( mostly) knew how to read and to write. He learned his colors and even had a favorite (grey). Harry knew how to tie his shoes,dress himself, and clean himself up at night. He knew how to run really fast, and climb trees really high, and to hide in the shadows.He learned to stay as quiet as possible; recognized the difference between a sprained ankle and a broken leg, and understand that fingers were not meant to be bent backwards, or that the sound of a snap meant pain. He knew what it felt like to be burned by the stove, the sound a belt makes on  a bare back, the feel of a fist hitting his stomach and his face. He quickly learned that to silence his tears, and that a mumble or a cry would make it worse.Yes, at six, Harry knew a lot, and not much of it was good. But this isn't just astory of what Harry knew, but also a story of what he will learn, and of how he will use that knowledge.

    Summary
      In  an alternate version of Harry Potter what would happen? Would Harry  still be in Gryffindor?  Would the trio still be close? Would Snape be perceived in the same way? Would Lily and James be alive? and would Sirius still end up in Azkaban? Well this story really is an alternate version. A lot of changes have been made. Some expected but others not so much.

    Summary
      Harry Potter hasn't always been this miserable only slightly less though, and he wishes so much he could go back to when his relatives ,the Dursley's, only beat him slightly when he spoke out of turn or when they would just lock him in his cupboard. Now Aunt Petunia hurts him in far more emotionally scarring ways than beatings and solitude. Uncle Vernon works him nearly to death everyday and anytime he is seen "slacking off" he is beaten within an inch of his life only to be somehow healed from the brink almost as if by magic every night. Will Harry Potter succumb to the abuse of his "family" or will the strange Silver Haired girl that catches his interest the day they meet in Diagon Alley be his Salvation in the end?

    Summary
      Harry Potter was a contrary creature.  He'd learned young that anything Vernon Dursley said the opposite was likely to be true.  So when he turned his teacher's hair blue - magic according to his classmates - and Vernon decried that "There Was No Such Thing As MAGIC" Harry knew that magic was real - more that magic was what he had.  A Grey Harry story.

    Summary
      In the world where Tom Marvolo Riddle becomes Minister of Magic and Albus Dumbledore secretly builds a resistance movement, Hadrian Castor Potter, second son of James and Lily Potter, feels alone and deprived of his heritage. Especially when no one believes him and in him. Hogwarts is like a vision of safe heaven but Dumbledore’s obsession with a prophecy grows, and soon political conflict will get more and more hostile. The perspective of difficult decisions, hard choices and conflicts is overwhelming, and there will be the time when Hadrian would face a point of no return. Alea iacta est, like said Julius Caesar.Beta-reader needed! I am happy to work with someone on the next chapter!

    Summary
      Licking the Philosopher's Stone was perhaps not something Harry would have done if he'd known what it was. But that act, along with so many others, started him down his path to building a library with Hermione and Millicent while Tom lurked in the background. So, he was happy with how things turned out.---Editing for grammar in April 2019. My great thanks and respect for Tazzm  for their rather phenomenal work.
