    Summary
      Katsuki was never into conspiracy theories, but as he sat inside his designated holding cell, with charges of abusing his authority, aggressive behavior/assault charges towards civilians and co-workers, among three other charges. He had a suspicious feeling, something was going on behind the scenes.

    Summary
      Bakugou walks into the room—Tenya had not noticed his quiet exit—with a serving tray full of labeled water bottles.“Oh, actually!” Ochako lets go of Izuku's hand to rummage in her cute little backpack. She pulls out several tubes of lubrication and even more boxes of variously-sized condoms, setting them aside almost casually—Tenya wants to blush but he also is so proud of their responsibility, and there’s nothing embarrassing about safe sex, not really, no matter how embarrassed he sometimes gets— until she emerges with a folded sheet of pink paper.She brandishes it with triumph, before reading aloud:“The students of 3-A dorm do formally have permission to utilize the second living room for team bonding on the night of Friday, 22nd of August, and to be excused from the night check in so long as a representative of the class texts a confirmation of accountability to the teacher on duty between 12 and 1am. Signed, the 18+ Hero: Midnight. P.s. Have fun kiddos! And Happy Birthday!”Or: It's Tenya's birthday.

    Summary
      "Dude it's like fucking heaven." Denki told them excitedly, his drunken whisper adding to the ambiance. "You can get anything, any drug, any drink; any fucking thing you've ever wondered about you can try there. And it's all safe!" He didn't get a chance to tell them everything before they had to separate and get ready for class, but they all agreed to meet up again when the day was over. Denki was going to give them all a personal tour of that place, and once the Bakusquad had their fill, they might be nice enough to let the rest of the class have a taste. -A tale of love, sex, and drugs shared between young souls just looking for a good time.

    Summary
      Midoriya's whole life has revolved around dance. It was at the core of his being and he wished with every fiber of that being that he would be a pro-dancer; but he was born frail, short and chronically clumsy. Despite that, and despite being told to quit by everyone even managed to get accepted into the prestigious UA Dance Academy, the country's top dance school. Now however, his fascination with breakdance, and admiration for his street-dancing childhood friend Bakugou, threaten to destroy his dreams and everything he's worked so hard for.Breakdance AU

    Summary
      As they headed back to their rooms through the common room, Kaminari spotted Bakugou looking out of the window.He peeked and noticed what he was looking at. "Ooh, you curious?" Bakugou glared at him."Why would I be" Kaminari smirked."I don't care! Let's use this as an excuse to sneak out! I cover your back you cover mine, yes??"Even though Bakugou hated Kaminari's skater boi attitude in moments like this, and he didn't want to ruin his record...If no one found out...

    Summary
      “We’re Royalty in Bondage, and we’re gonna wreck your shit!”Before Kirishima could reach out, Kaminari had lost his footing and two of their drinks splattered to the ground… and onto the amp cords. The sound screeched and flickered to a stop.Fuck.In which Kirishima and Kaminari wreck Bakugou, Mina, and Sero's shit.

    Summary
      Todoroki is confused. Puzzled. Befuddled.It’s been 2 years since UA established the dorm system and already, Todoroki is certain that Class 3-A will bring about his early death. Or at least, his early pro hero retirement. That is, if he even graduates. He’s going insane, he thinks.He didn’t think it was humanly possible for 3-A to grow any closer than they already had, but of course the class always finds a way to prove others wrong. Maybe that’s their collective second quirk.Todoroki pauses for a minute, “I mean, aren’t we a bit… close for classmates?"...On second thought, he doesn’t really mind their confusing dynamic all that much.-Or, snapshots into Class 3-A's confusing polyamorous relationship with each other. They're gay. They're so gay.

    Summary
      This story follows Bakugo, Kirishima, Yaoyorozu, and Hagakure, on a short adventure, that brings them all closer together. Meanwhile, back at the dorms, the rest of the class receive an unexpected visitor. It's just a light, wholesome story, that adds a bit more depth to certain character dynamics by sticking as close to cannon as possible. Hopefully, it's a little funny too!
