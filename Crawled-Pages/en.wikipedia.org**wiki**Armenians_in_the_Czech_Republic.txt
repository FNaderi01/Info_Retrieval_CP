History[edit]
Unlike Armenian communities throughout eastern and central Europe, the Armenian community of the Czech republic is made up entirely of recent immigrants, as there are no previous history of Armenian communities in the region.[2] Most have come to the region after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, others fleeing poor economic conditions in the Armenian Republic.
The Armenian Community in the Czech Republic is still growing, as signified with the opening of an Armenian Saturday school in Prague in 1996, the establishment of an Armenian Cultural Center and the later establishment of the Orer (Օրեր) magazine (1999), edited by  Hakob Asatryan, a former journalist for the Azg (Ազգ) paper in Yerevan who moved to Prague around 1998.[2]
It is believed Armenians may have trouble acclimating to this country, as citizenship requires you to undergo a rigorous registration process, rather than becoming a citizen at birth.
On April 3 and 4, 2006, Armenian Deputy Minister Arman Kirakossian visited the Czech Republic, meeting with Jaroslav Bašta, the 1st Deputy Foreign Minister of the country, Jaromír Plíšek, Director General of the Territorial Section, and a representative of the local Armenian community.[3] Topics of discussion included trade and inter-parliamentary links.
Language[edit]
Armenian migrants freely speak the Russian language which was a subject needed at Czech schools until the end of the 1980s. This has had some impact on the language integration of the Armenian community. The knowledge of Russian may make it easier for Armenians to communicate with locals, and those of the older generation.[4]
