He whirls around, but there’s nothing there, though he spends several long seconds waiting. It must have been his imagination, and he turns back, continuing on.Nothing happens for at least a minute, and he lets himself slowly start to relax… until he hears a strange tapping sound, like a dog’s claws on tile. Again, there’s nothing behind him, but he knows he couldn’t have imagined that. Jaskier tries to swallow around the lump in his throat.Jaskier returns to the mall once more

                                                                        The best cover for Bruce Wayne would be dumb carefree playboy who is also Instagram Optimistic, everyday he’s posting a selfie of his smiling at his breakfast with a caption like “it’s a waffle day! #goodvibesingotham #grateful” or a picture of a sunrise with a caption that’s just “wow #blessed” 
                                                                        feynites

And his instagram is a bright ray of sunshine, and honestly there are a lot of people in the city who get surprisingly defensive of their Dumb Carefree Playboy because, okay, sure, every month or so Bruce Wayne falls off a yacht or sleeps with a reporter or whatever. The man clearly never met a healthy coping skill even once in his life.But as far as news regarding Gotham’s prominent citizens go, Bruce’s ‘scandals’ are so normal that it’s downright refreshing. When a headline has ‘Bruce Wayne’ in the title, you know you’re either going to read some Celebrity Gossip level non-drama, or else something to do with a charity. Maybe he’s been kidnapped again, but that’s only happened a few times. Bruce Wayne news is like the Gotham equivalent to special reports about dogs who rescue their owners from drowning, or raccoons who’ve figured out how to get past the new self-locking garbage can lids.And there’s something weirdly reassuring about following his twitter. Like, if Bruce Wayne is tweeting about a really neat old tree he just saw, things must at least be sort of alright.(Meanwhile, Bruce’s social media persona is 100% him flanderizing Clark.)
                                                                        stumblinthrulife
                                                                        Local Gotham news has started using him as a buffer for the awful celebrity news stories.“Coming up, allegations of this beloved celebrity’s criminal misconduct has shocked and horrified the nation. But first, Bruce Wayne fell out of his yacht again.” 
                                                                        kereeachan
                                                                        I have to quibble with some of this. Bruce’s social media feeds cannot be all charity and making himself look like a super positive guy by flandarizing Clark. Y’all forgot gushing about his many kids like the dorky dad Bruce Wayne obviously is and making it very clear these kids too are not the sort of people who could ever be confused for vigilantes. Bruce’s biggest scandal in years is when Damian turns up because wait, wait, wait, this one’s not adopted? Bruce Wayne had a secret biological kid this whole time? WHAT?  Bruce counters with cheery posts about how well Damian is adjusting and the boys are getting along, and then Dick starts a side twitter about fun times with his new little brother and it’s all water under the bridge from there. Bruce routinely fills his feeds with good report cards, candid family meal pictures, the kids getting ready for various charity events, and random shit like Damian’s growing animal collection or Jason working on cars or Tim gaming or Duke and Dick competing at who can do more of Alfred’s chores on Father’s day (answer: Cass). Some of the more tabloid-y media keep waiting for one of the kids to have a serious rebellious phase, never knowing that in this family those are expressed by changing your vigilante name and running off to the Teen Titans for a little while.

I would not be surprised if the percentage of autistics in fandom communities was significantly higher than in the general public.And that's not even getting into other types of neurodivergencies and how they influence fandom culture.I sometimes see people try to divorce fandom culture from the idea of being a "geek", and I understand that this is sometimes because of the association with the sexist geek stereotype, but I also know that there is a connection between the two concepts, and it's probably us neurodivergent people.
                                                                        autisticchangeling

                                                                        mycroftrh
                                                                        I’ll go slightly further here, and say this (well. this plus ableism) is the root of a lot of current issues in fandom.Back when I started being in fandom, a couple decades ago, I’d argue that damn near every single person in fandom was autistic or ADHD.  You’d only join fandom if you were obsessive and were chill with doing things that weren’t socially acceptable.  (Because being a fan absolutely was not socially acceptable at the time!  We went to ridiculous amounts of effort to hide that we were fans!)And fandom culture was absolutely shaped by this.  The standard behaviors in fandom were those of happy autistics.  That’s how you were expected to act.  You remember “squeeing”?  The visual image of it is generally someone so happy and excited they can’t physically contain it so they make a high-pitched noise and flap their hands and - a squee is literally just a happy stim. And so many fans at the time did happy stims that we gave it a special fandom name!  So even if a neurotypical person happened to stumble in, they’d learn that the “social norm” in a fandom space is basically just “act autistic/ADHD” and assimilate.But then... fandom got mainstreamed.  It became socially acceptable.  And then the neurotypicals started showing up in large numbers.  And instead of assimilating like they did before, when they were the minority, now that there were a lot of them they started going “what the heck is this! why are people here acting so weird!  this is embarrassing!”...and then we got cringe culture within fandom.No one says “squee” anymore not because fans don’t squee anymore - happy stims don’t just go away - but because the neurotypicals showed up and told us “squee” is a cringy word and concept.  Which they had ALWAYS told us out in public, but we used to have fandom as an insular autistic/ADHD-dominated space where we were safe and free to be ourselves.You know how everybody talks about how cringy and embarrassing 2012 tumblr was?  Dude.  We were literally just acting like happy autistics, because that’s what we were.  It’s just that - like you always have - you think autistic/ADHD behavior is cringy and embarrassing.This isn’t new.  “Cringe culture” isn’t new.  It’s just a new euphemism for the exact same ableism that’s always existed, with the only difference that now it’s coming from inside fandom.All those posts saying “if these people were bullied more they wouldn’t act like this”?  They’re not just bizarrely tasteless jokes.  They’re because the people making those posts were bullies.  Are bullies.  Fandom used to be where the sort of people who were victims of peer abuse went - where we went to be safe from bullies and be openly ourselves - but now the bullies are in here with us.On the happier side, while mainstreaming has resulted in a lot of neurotypicals showing up, autistic/ADHD people are absolutely still the backbone of fandom.  We’re the ones collecting tiny bits of info and connecting the dots to write galaxy brain meta.  We’re the ones churning out new content every single day, rain or shine.  We’re the hyper-verbal ones writing 250k fics and the ones who hyper-relate with the characters and make incorrect quote posts so spot-on they sound canon. They may think we’re embarrassing - but they still need us.
                                                                        azcrowleyfell

Because there’s nothing on this earth that can rival the white-hot intensity of an Autistic or ADHD person in full-blown hyperfocus or special interest mode.
