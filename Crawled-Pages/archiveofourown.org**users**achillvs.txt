What does it feel like, to be that close to someone? Sure, he doesn’t feel attracted to anyone in a sexual way, but he’s always wondered what sex feels like.(There’s also a little voice in the back of his mind, saying what if you like it?What if you're a fraud?)or,Jeongguk has sex with his boyfriends for the first time. It doesn't go well, but Taehyung and Yoongi remind him just how loved he is.

    Summary
      usually, a-yuan would come in, sleepy soft, his voice still in a lower cadence and his consonants slurred. it’s honestly the most adorable thing and wei ying’s phone regularly notifies him of running out of storage space because of his videos. but today, a-yuan is awfully alert, no trace of that drowsiness. in fact it seems that he has been awake for a while. he isn’t latching onto wei ying for cuddles either or asking after lan zhan.
or: wei ying and lan zhan as they stumble through parenthood with their son.
