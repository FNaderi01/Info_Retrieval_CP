                                                A Study In Aubergine
                                                    @pinksunset2905  marilyns-child I present my humble submission in your quest for Outlander Library Fanfic.fanfic masterlistHe was reeling with lust. The night had filled his senses
with the smell of rich food, potent wine, the reek of tobacco smoke and hair
powder and the sharp tang of unwashed bodies clouded with sweet perfume. He
needed air, and he needed Claire. Badly. He was tired beyond bearing of
simpering conversations filled with politely malicious intent. And he was most
terribly sick of watching foppish French bastards throw themselves at is wife,
patting and grabbing, kissing and nudging, offering all manner of lewd
entertainments at the expense of her honor and her husband. They were
scoundrels to a man.All night Claire had been just beyond his reach, seated on
either side at dinner by courtiers of particular importance. He had watched her
during his own tedious tête-à-têtes – her gracious smiles and the genteel
inclinations of her head in acknowledgment of a clever remark, the pleasure
never quite reaching her eyes. She looked so beautiful in her gown. He had been told it was
‘aubergine’ but he cared not at all for such details. All he knew was that the
color set off her skin in the candlelight as if she were made of shimmering
pearls. Pale and creamy, her breasts swelled above a flourish of lace with each
intake of breath and the beauty mark she had placed low on her décolletage was
driving him to distraction. It was meant to. He had told her to wear it, as it
would distract the financers present at dinner tonight, making it easier for
her to coax them into sharing tidbits of information they wouldn’t likely share
with him. Men always underestimated his wife at their own peril. She had fanned and flirted and batted her lashes at any
number of men following dinner and while he had asked her to do just that, had
needed her skillful manipulations, he was beginning to be annoyed not only by
how deftly she was able to lead these men along a path strewn with sexual
promise, but how much she seemed to enjoy it. He was possessive of Claire in
his mildest temper, but these damned formal dinners, where they barely made eye
contact, let alone had a chance to touch or talk, made him greedy and mad with
need. To sit and watch the wee fools buzz around her like bees to honey,
thinking they might have a chance to lift her skirts… Dammit! He had to have
her or die in a frenzy of desire. Marching abruptly up to Claire and Monsieur Moreau, an
acquaintance of Monsieur Duvernay, Jamie turned a ferocious countenance on the
man who was clutching at his wife with lascivious hands and made a tremendous
effort to calm himself. “I need a moment with my wife, if you’ll pardon us.” He
stated so abruptly as to fail utterly in every attempt at civility.He didn’t care. All he could think of was having Claire,
now, swift and hard. He would hear her cry out in an intoxicating mixture of
pleasure and pain and know that it was he, alone, who served her - he alone who
could cause her to throw her head back in ecstasy, to lose herself in her own
lust - he alone who could bring her to the very edge of submission or quiver
and shake under her shameless domination.Grabbing her firmly by the arm, he led her brusquely through
the silks and satins of their guests, pushing rudely past people in his way. He
made eye contact with no one, unwilling to be interrupted. He claimed her mouth
in a heated fury as they reached the door to the library, tongue plundering her
mouth with single-minded intent. He burst into the room and had her up against
the nearest wall of books in what seemed to be a single long stride. His hands
were simultaneously rucking up her skirts and plunging into her bodice when she
stiffened slightly and gasped into his ear, “The door, Jamie.
“Damn the door!” Jamie replied. And damn the servants, damn the guests and damn
anyone else who might have something to say, he thought viciously.He moved from her lips to her neck, sucking and biting,
exulting in the livid red marks he left in his wake. He ripped and tore at her
laces, heedless of the delicate fabric in his haste to get to her breasts. He
suckled her nipples, hard under his tongue, until she squirmed and moaned into
his ear.“Now, Jamie, please.”His only response was a guttural snarl ripped from his
primal center. He grabbed her wrists and held them up, high above her head, providing
him even greater exposure to her full breasts, and raised her up onto her toes.
He shifted her wrists to one hand, deftly releasing his breeches with the other
and bunching Claire’s skirts up around her waist. He had worshiped at her
breasts until he nearly lost himself, and now thrust home the moment she was
exposed to him. The heat and sweet wetness of her was overpowering and he
finally allowed the lust to engulf him completely. Heedless of surroundings or
propriety, he released her wrists and grabbed her by the buttocks, sheathing
himself impossibly deep, while she wrapped her legs tightly around his waist.
He heard the smack of flesh meeting wood and books and was dimly aware of her
whimpering and moaning. Some part of him realized that he must restrain himself
lest he hurt her. He stilled for the briefest moment, trying to slow the
frenzied thrusting, but she growled in turn, biting his neck, and raked her nails
down his back, bucking her hips in a gesture of violent demand, bringing him
back to that place of uncontrolled hunger. “Damn you, Claire Fraser. You are mine.” He growled into her
ear. “Mine, and I willna share you again tonight with one of those lecherous
fiends intent on swiving ye.” He punctuated his words with his hips, each assault
being met with an equal response from Claire. His powerful thighs quivered
under the strain and he clenched his buttocks tightly, driving himself home,
feeding the fire that had burned in his breast all night. When he had taken them to a place beyond both pleasure and
pain and they existed only as possession and exquisite sensation, he shifted
his stance and altered his pace, forcing Claire to her release. She arched her
back and ground her hips in circles against him. She started to moan, but her breath
caught and she cried out, her thighs quivering and shaking against his hips.
She clenched tight around him and it was this delicious squeezing that brought
him to his own release. He threw his head back and let out a cry of sensual joy
that was surely heard by the entire household. Claire collapsed against the shelving as he collapsed
against her, the dew of their exertion cooling their heated skin. When he could
breathe again, Jamie straightened up, but didn’t yet release Claire. “Go up to our room, Sassenach.” He commanded. “Take off your
clothes, and put on your new shift. The one with the lace and embroidery I
bought ye. And unpin your hair so it curls about your face, aye?”“Jamie…” Claire started to argue, but was interrupted.“Dinna worry. I’ll tell them all ye’ve taken a turn and must
retire. It’s late enough that I can send everyone home. Use the back stairs. I
dinna want any of those bastards to see ye half dressed.”“Surely everyone in the house heard us, Jamie. They’ll know
I’m not indisposed.” Claire blushed prettily and he felt the embers of sated
desire smolder and spark to life again. Lord, this woman was going to be the
death of him tonight.Pinching her bottom playfully he pushed her towards the rear
of the library. “Aye, Sassenach. They’ll know. But nearly every man in the room
heard Louise tell Madame Duvernay that she had Girard over to her salon today.
A very indiscreet woman, Louise. There’s nay a man present who’ll begrudge me a
wee taste of your freshly polished honeypot.”

Anyone who’s ever written a piece then taken the risk and posted it is doing something profoundly brave. They’re putting a part of themself, a piece of their imagination, out there to be seen. That deserves some acknowledgement. So the punctuation isn’t perfect. Maybe the grammar is shit. Cliches run amok. I don’t care. They took the leap and I applaud them for that.Everyone starts somewhere and no one ever gets better without practice. I’m in the business of trying to uplift people where I can and if there is one good thought, one good sentence, one neat idea they are getting a like.None of us are perfect. In a time when people are so mean and hateful to one another the offer of a small bit of kindness, even if it’s something as simple as the click of a button, can mean the world to someone and give them the encouragement they need.
