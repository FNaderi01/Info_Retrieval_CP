You blinked owlishly at him, wondering when the hell he’d even slipped into your office.“I saw you pinching your nose through the window. You only do that when you have a headache,” he said in lieu of a greeting, looking pointedly down at his palm. You looked down as well and saw two painkillers in his grip, held out to you as an offering. Keep reading

CEO Kim Namjoon had recently taken over for his aging father, and Taehyung was thankful to be working under the younger man; the vibe in the office had shifted to one that was more relaxed, though still respectable.“Sir.” Kim Taehyung bowed his head before standing up from the large table, gathering his folders and the papers falling out of them, dismissed from the office after the morning briefing.Taehyung left the briefing room, walking down the hall to take the elevator down to return to his office, which was a beautiful glass windowed corner workplace. The elevator opened up to the 48th floor, and Taehyung stepped out.“Um, sir? Mr. Kim?” Your soft voice came from behind Taehyung as you followed him dutifully back towards his office. He paused his walk mid-stride, turning slowly to look back over his shoulder at you, an eyebrow raised into his blonde hair. He was tall, lean, and had the face of a model; easily the most attractive person you had ever had the pleasure of working under in your entire life. Keep reading
