    [OM!] Demon Brothers panic-buy MC a last-minute birthday present
            Prompt: You drop the fact that your birthday is in a few days, much to the demon brothers’ surprise. They don’t have a gift for you prepared– panic ensues. Note: gender neutral; :) i just like seeing them get flustered –Lucifer“Ah, your birthday? Of course I knew. You thought I didn’t?”He didn’t know– not until you told him just then a mere DAYS before your birthdayInternally panicking but he will NOT have you know that he missed this rather important detailCasually asks you in the next few days if you’re free to go out with him because “he wants to spend more time with you–” which he DOES but he has ulterior motives such as hoping you’d point out something you like when you go out so he can gift it to youWill watch your movement and gestures like a hawk trying to gauge what sort of present you would want from himMoney isn’t really a concern of him; he just wants to make sure that his gift is something you actually want and is thoughtful enoughIf he’s unlucky and you are in fact NOT free in the few days leading up to your birthday, he paces a lot in his room, trying to remember if there was something you mentioned from a past conversation because he has too much pride asking you what you would want for your birthday…but eventually caves in and asks his other brothers (probably Asmo or Beel) what they think you would like because his love for you &gt;&gt;&gt; his pride He has seared your birthdate into his mind now because he’d rather not have a repeat of whatever happened this year–Mammon“Your birthday? Hahaha of COURSE I knew your birthday was in a few days… IN A FEW DAYS–?!”He blurts this out but you tell him it’s fine but he won’t have itHe’ll try to cover it up, pretending he knew, but he sucks at lying and the fact he suspiciously walks out of your room to find a quick job listing to get enough money for a present is telling enoughFirst ideas most likely include rummaging in his room for anything valuable or shiny that you could possibly wantConsiders giving you his car for a second in his panic but realizes you’d probably freak out at the extremely extravagant present Will definitely try to snoop in his brothers’ rooms in search of things and collectively tells them (and makes them panic) about your birthday as well Eventually sucks it up and works at Hell’s Kitchen, literally diving underneath counters and tables to avoid having you see him working Terrible at making excuses to you about where he is so you probably know he’s working, and he feels bad that he has to avoid hanging out with you– but he loves you and this is for you, after all, so he bears it Buys you something he finds value in and thinks would like nice if you wore it; after all, the Avatar of Greed wants the best he can afford for you–LeviathanYou tell him your birthday is coming up soon while he’s playing something and the only thing he says first is “oh nice”Then he realizes“YOUR BIRTHDAY IS WHEN??”He died on the screen, which you point out, but his eyes are wide and a little pleadingAsks you directly what you want for your birthday and he will literally search it up for you on Akuzon right there and then (it’s wild seeing online shopping on several screens)“How about this one? Wait, no– that’s terrible quality and the reviews are horrible; let’s check out this one.”Makes you tell him everything you could have possibly wanted in the past few months so he can compile a list of things he can search up and select fromIf he’s manic for the next few days, know that he hasn’t been gaming (has not since you dropped this very important detail) but has been vigorously searching up all the online shopping sites he can find to get the things you wanted down to its detail and quality Definitely enlists his online friends for recommendations, but regardless will buy you matching gaming headset on top of whatever you wanted because he wants you to know you’re his Player 2, even if you don’t gameAll the presents come on the same day (Mammon grumbles that it’s blocking the walkway) and he shoos you away as he carts everything up to his room to wrap itWishes he had more time to make you a present instead of buying something but hey there’s always next year–Satan“O-Oh. Your birthday is in a few days, huh?” Satan stares at you for a few moments too long as if he wants to say something but decides against it and gives you a benign conversation starter like “You must be excited for another year done” Inwardly, he’s trying to calculate in his head when he has time to research for things you want, if going on a cat cafe date is too indulgent to be a gift to you, if he should just ask you what you want for a present– all while holding a conversation with youNot a great conversation, mind you– you can tell he’s a little preoccupied, but you’re more worried about how his sentences trail than anythingPops up randomly in the next few days in your room just to chat, looks around your room, and then leaves again (like a cat)He’s trying to find a present that you’d want to use– something practical– but also something you’d also enjoy having (he’s setting up high standards, but he wants his gift to be good enough for you)Low-key stressing a lot over this that he’s a little distracted at all times Ends up combining all his gift ideas by setting up a date for you to spend some quality time with him AND buy your gift when the two of you are together AND has a gift ready for you just in case nothing catches your fancy on your date (he is anything if not prepared for all scenarios)The gift he gets you is something he’d think you’d enjoy or reminded him of you (and hopes for the best) –Asmodeus“WHY DIDN’T YOU TELL ME EARLIER?” Asmo is almost offended that you didn’t tell him about your birthday– how is he supposed to set up a extravagant birth week celebration if your birthday is in a few days?But no matter– he’s not that discouraged and is determined to rock your socks off with a present anyways, even though he would have definitely had your birthday celebration as a tag for the entire month if he had the time (now it’s only a week-long trending tag, but he’ll make do)Will definitely coyly offer up himself as a present (and if you say yes, he will be at your mercy) but thinks he has more creativity that than to make you special day greatTakes you on a shopping spree where he dresses you up in the fanciest of clothes and things that you have always adored and refuses to let up until you let him buy you a giftOn the day of your birthday, he offers up his room as an entire spa day– pedicure, manicure, whatever-cure you would ever want! Massage, face mask, bubble bath– if there’s anything that can let him show how much he appreciates you, then tell him! He is at your mercy today!Takes you out on a spin in town, buying you drinks and dancing with you at clubs if that’s what you want; but the night is yours, hun!BeelzebubYou tell him when he’s eating something and his face morphs from surprised, delight, to sadness “I… didn’t get you a present yet…” You reassure him that it’s completely okay, but you know your words aren’t working because he still has that forlorn expression that reminds you of a kicked puppyAsks you directly what you would want and if you tell him he’d be more than happy to get whatever it is you requested, even if it’s a physical gift or if you want to spend the entire day with himIt is your birthday and he already feels bad for not being able to really prepare for it properly, so he’ll do anything he can to make you happy If you don’t tell him what you want, you better be strong enough to resist looking into his eyes to not cave into just telling what you want Eventually settles on giving you something thoughtful and quickly hand-made– like a set of coupons that say things such as ‘I will do your chores for a week’ or ‘I will make you dinner’ The coupon book has a lot of food-related things than anything, but you know his love language is basically food– he loves you lots, okay?Other than that, he’s super indulgent to you on your birthday. You want a lift? No problem. You want him to carry you bridal style to school? Sure, he can’t see why not!–Belphegor“Wait, seriously? You waited until NOW to let me know?”Kind of annoyed about the fact you dropped this detail on him now and decides to immediately punish you by trapping you in his embrace in a forced snuggle even while you laugh (so honestly, you have no regrets)Tells you he’s not getting you a presentHe’s getting you a present though, regardless of what he says, but now he has the element of surprise on his side (assuming you believe that he’s not getting you something)Hangs out with you per usual in the next few days, paying more attention to what you would want in a present and asking low-key questions about possible gift ideas– he’s real sneaky about it, so you honestly won’t pick up on it at allGoes out of his way to help you study and help you out because it is your birthday, after all, and he’s pretending like he didn’t get you a presentProbably casually drops off a gift at your desk on your birthday, and if you’re surprised, he’s a little smug– but if you’re not, he’ll be a little embarrassed but will tell you to just ‘open the present already’ Gift is most likely to be something that he’s noticed that you have continually needed but never had the thought or time to get– just to make your life a little easier Tells you to go nap with him as compensation for the work he’s done trying to think up of a gift for you
