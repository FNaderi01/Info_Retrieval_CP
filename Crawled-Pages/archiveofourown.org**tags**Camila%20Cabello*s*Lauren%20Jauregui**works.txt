    Summary
      Lauren hasn’t been in a relationship since college and while she’s had some casual flings, nothing’s clicked. She’s aware of why (and she hates it), but things change when one of her best friends, Normani, introduces her to her friends.Camila’s boyfriend, for lack of a better explanation, is not right for her, no matter how in denial she is about that. However, he’s good to her, they go on fun dates and he gets along with her friends fine. That doesn’t change that she doesn’t really have too many feelings for him.Everything shifts when Lauren and Camila meet each other. Lauren doesn’t want a crush on a straight girl, and Camila doesn’t think she’s gay, but she does want to know the depths of Lauren and why there’s something so off about the other girl.Because, what is so off about Lauren? And why does Camila kind of want to know all of it and more?

    Summary
      “la vida es una locura, pero de esa misma forma nos enseña lo bueno y lo malo”una estaba atada a una relación falsa sin saber porque y la otra pensaba que su vida estaba resuelta, ¿que sucede cuando se dan cuenta de que no es así?  Tal vez esta no sea la misma historia de amor que han leído tantas veces; es algo que podemos ver día a día cuando no estamos muy sumidos en nuestros pensamientos.

    Summary
      MAJOR AU!!!!!ALL RIGHTS TO ORIGINAL AUTHOR (Samatha Towle)Racecar mechanic Lauren Jauregui has one rule-no dating drivers. With a good reason behind the rule, she has no plans on breaking it. Camila Cabello is the bad boy of Formula One. With a face and body that melts panties on sight, leaves women on their knees, and begging for more. She races hard and parties harder. The youngest driver to ever sign with F1, she's still at the top of her game five years later, breaking hearts on and off the tracks. When Lauren is offered her dream job working in the glamorous world of F1, she leaves her home in Brazil, positive she can handle working for Camila. But she's not prepared for the off-the-chart sparks that fly the moment they meet. Now, Lauren has a crush on the one person she can't have, and her resolve is about to be put to the test, because Camila has decided she wants Lauren, and she plans on testing her to the very limit.

    Summary
      "Did you have a nice time at the Jauregui's?"
She hums softly, nodding. "Yes. I always do. Her family... her parents, they're just like you and mamá." She looks up at him, lightly laying her hand on his cheek. "Papí... I... I really think she might be the one."
Alejandro stares down at her. At her innocent honey eyes, how they shine with so much adoration and love for her previous bandmate. He presses his lips to her forehead, pulling her close, and says, "I hope she deserves you. I hope she deserves all the love you give, your golden heart, your beautiful words. I hope she treats you well, treats you like the princess you are. Gives you half the love you give her."
It comes out as, "If she is, she's lucky to have someone as wonderful as you to love her."

    Summary
      Ever since people first existed, they have been doing all the things we label “codependent”. They have worried themselves sick about other people. They have been afraid to trust their feelings. They have worn sackcloth, because they didn’t believe they deserved silk. (M.B.) In 2020, Camila finds Lauren again, the night before her debut album release.

    Summary
      We always loved, with a love that was more than love. Perhaps, that was too daring of us. But we wouldn't stop mocking fate, and you would always laugh in its face. In 2020, Camila and Lauren find each other again.
