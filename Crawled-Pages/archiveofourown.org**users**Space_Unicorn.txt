    Summary
      A random assortment of one-shots, AUs, and ideas I have for the My Hero Universe. Updates sporadically (ie, when I get a random burst of inspiration)Anyone is welcome to use these ideas or quirks in their own fics. Just let me know so I can read 'em!And if any chapters gain a big following, I may just make them a full fic or an Extended;)

    Summary
      Lord Voldemort stared at the cradle, blinking slowly in a way that some would compare to a reptile. There was not one, but two children where he had only been expecting one. Staring down at them, he lost his snake-like glamour and leaned forward. “Which one of you… is my supposed death?”OrAlbus Dumbledore’s warnings came to fruition.~ON HOLD~
