    Summary
      “Avatar Roku was betrayed by your great-grandfather,” spat the woman with the quirk of her pompous brow. “I was educated in the top university in the Earth Kingdom, Ba Sing Se University. The history books tell truths. Unlike the professors in the Fire Nation, ours don’t lie to their students.” Her emerald green silk dress ruffled with her.“Ah,” stuttered the Earth King as he adjusted his glasses, “I believe this may be uncalled for Lady Yin.” “How can we trust the descendant of a murderer to cultivate peace?” Lady Yin plowed on, utterly disregarding Earth King Kuei. “He has poison in his bloodline! Isn’t that right, Avatar Aang?” -Or, Zuko meets Roku and learns what it means to be a friend.
