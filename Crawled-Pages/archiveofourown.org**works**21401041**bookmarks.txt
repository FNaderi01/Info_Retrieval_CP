      Bookmarking again because I literally come back to this story every single night. Highly recommend if anyone here is actually looking at my dashboard lol. Obviously, read the tags before you get into it, and FYI this is part two of an INCREDIBLE series, so check out the first half before you look at this one. While you’re at it, I highly recommended reading the rest of their stories because this person is insanely creative and eloquent. Ok I need to shut up. you get the idea. READ IT!!!!!
