              will be before you decide whether to participate.) You’ll also have our eternal
              gratitude for helping us make Google products the best they can be.
              Driven to perfect our products
              Meet the Google research van
              We want to create the best product experiences for Google users everywhere. That’s
              why we built a research van — to visit as many people and places as we can, find out
              how they use our products, and get their honest feedback.

              We can’t wait to hear from you
              If you're a potential match for an upcoming study, one of our research coordinators
              will send you a follow-up questionnaire and details about next steps. And if you're
              invited to participate, you'll work one-on-one with a Google researcher, either in a
              lab setting or your own space. Remember that there are no right or wrong answers —
              every bit of your feedback will help us improve the products we create.
