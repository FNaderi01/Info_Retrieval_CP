A popular myth says that humans with wolf heritage, commonly called lycanthropes, hunt humans to devour them.
Hunters have taken part of the country's territories, sowing fear and killing entire packs until they are reduced to ashes. War has been openly declared and it may be time to stop it. But… will the few remaining packs be able to stop their advance?

    Summary
      "Matsun got his legs to move, because these ‘things’ had spotted him. He ran past the fallen and crying people on the floor, ignoring the grieving mother crying while holding her child, only to be attacked and bitten in the neck a few seconds later. Issei corrected himself: these things were definitely zombies, and from now on, he would refer to them as such. Man-eating zombies. He shouldn’t have gotten out of bed today. He regretted it already."

    Summary
      In this AU soulmates can identify each other through their “inner voice”. A person’s inner voice is the voice of their soulmates and might use similar vocabulary or catch phrases, but does not necessarily has their personality (since one’s inner voice is still one’s own thoughts, feelings and mental issues)./Every chapter will deal with a different pair of soulmates. They will be loosely connected and follow the timeline of the Anime seasons 1/2/3/4 (it will probably end with a chapter that is set after the Spring Tournament 2013).

    Summary
      Sawamura Daichi thought moving countries would stop his adoptive grandfather, Ukai Ikkei, from chasing after him. And so the man decides to start over a new life of peace with his best friend and former bodyguard as roommate. What the man doesn't realise is how stubborn and persuasive the Ukai-gumi yakuza can be. And as though Sawamura didn't seem to have enough trouble in his life, his hot new boss and a particularly dashing detective come barging in to add onto the chaos. Peace wasn't in the fate of one Sawamura Daichi, the heir to a massive Yakuza family.

    Summary
      Life as a famous man isn't easy.Granted, Oikawa's fame is restricted to his university campus, and it comes with a lot of benefits, like never having to study, and making out with a different person each Friday night. Everyone loves him - well, everyone who doesn't have to deal with him on a regular basis, Misaki would say, but what does Misaki know? She doesn't have a website dedicated to her everyday adventures. She has no idea how hard it is to keep your fans entertained, to keep them happy, to keep them from suddenly changing their objective from winning a trophy for being Oikawa's chosen Friday night hook-up to shipping him with his old rival and current teammate Ushijima Wakatoshi. Seriously. It was one night. One mistake, and suddenly, Oikawa's life goes from rollercoaster to drop tower.

    Summary
  The notifications are up at 100+ again and Hana wants to check it quickly to make sure nothing's wrong, especially because she'd just cleared them before the media scrum. The fans, she figured, must be overjoyed with the win.
  Congratulations MSBY Nation!!! the first reply reads. #myspiker #atsuhina
  Both tags, she finds, are currently trending in Japan.
Five times #atsuhina trended on volleyball Twitter and one time it should have (but luckily didn't), as told by the MSBY Black Jackals' junior publicist

    Summary
      He might not look like much, but Nishinoya Yuu is just as much an Alpha as the next guy. He doesn't mind the looks he gets when people realize he's not a petite omega, or the whispers behind his back about his greased hair and leather jacket. He takes pride in his crew, and loves his pack more than anything.But the cute omega he meets at the sock hop across town runs a close second.---Alpha Greaser meets Preppy Omega, and the rest is history.Or so Noya'd like to say, because now he's on the run from the law, Asahi is panicked and confused, and his pack just wants him to be safe.

    Summary
      Hinata Shouyou, son, brother. herbalist, healer, midwife, friend, guardian to one Hinata Natsu. There are many words to describe him, but the default will always be one he was born with, one that he’ll take to his grave.Omega.It’s not like he hated his secondary gender, it’s just that it seemed to hinder his life in a way that neither Betas or Alphas had to deal with. But he learned to use it to his advantage, not allowing anyone to look down on him because of it.Soon enough he became a midwife that helped deliver babies to still living mothers, as well as healing the sick. His skill soon becomes something many high ranking people wish to have in their courts, but no one will force him to live a life he doesn’t want. He is human and he will decide on his future by himself, even if it may cost him his life, at least it was his to live.Hopefully it won’t ever come to that. //Updates every Tuesday, Thursday, and every other Saturday

    Summary
      “What if I get a boyfriend though? I’ll need to add his phone number when we start dating.”Yuji looked at you with a betrayed expression, but quickly changed it to a grin once he saw the teasing glint in your eyes.“Like I said, you won’t need anymore phone numbers.”“But then how will I contact him?”“Don’t worry. His number is already in your contacts.”You smiled, realizing what he was saying. But you weren’t going to let him go that easily.“Hmm, I see.”He nodded along with you, thinking that you understood the underlying meaning behind his words.“So you’re saying that I’ll date someone who’s already on my phone.”“Yup.”“So, Bobata is going to be my boyfriend?”“Yup yup-wait what?”

    Summary
  He slides another Barbie shot toward you and you realize you have no recollection of him even ordering it.
  “I can’t take that,” you half-laugh, rubbing your face.
  “Yeah, you can,” he tells you, holding his up. “You aren’t going to leave me hangin’, are you, princess?”
  The nickname has you reaching for the glass, blood rushing to some part of your body you can’t pinpoint. “If I take it, I’m done for the moment I stand up.”
  “Don’t worry- I think that’s sexy.”
