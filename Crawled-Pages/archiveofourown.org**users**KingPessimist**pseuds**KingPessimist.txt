    Summary
      "That's probably why Katsuki can say that he's not clingy or crying his eyes out for not seeing his boyfriend in the last two weeks. They both have their own personal life, something that they did talk about before choosing their own high schools. Between school, training and their occasional video calls at 9 PM, there is no moment for him to whine over the other.However, there are those nights when the nightmares are too much. When Katsuki wakes up covered in sweat, not able to breath properly or move. When it takes him minutes, if not hours, to convince his own head that he's safe, he's into the dorms at the moment, nothing is going to happen to him or anybody else. When all he can do is watch the ceiling until his phone's alarm goes off, announcing a new day in which he did not sleep more than three hours.That's when he can't help himself but wish for Kariage to be by his side, just to know that he's ok. Is in those days that Katsuki can't make himself change into the school uniform, clinging into his boyfriend's hoodie as if the life depends of it. Days when the smell of cigarettes smoke mixed with cheap aftershave and beer does no longer annoy him, instead calming down his heart beats and grounding him."

Period Iregular Updates I Will Go Down With This Ship
    Summary
  "Katsuki should have known that the whole family trip will be totally bullshit and 
    not worth it
   the moment he and Half'n Half show up in front of Yuuei's gates and the whole Todoroki family look at him as if he grew a second head right in front of them‚Äî actually, they might have found it less weird if he did grew up that head instead of showing up to their family camping trip."
Katsuki did not ask for any of this, yet the Todoroki family drama won't stop following him around. He blames it on that cursed moment when he did overhear on IcyHot and Deku during their first year sport festival‚Äî he's sure that this would have not happened if he did ignore the two that fateful day.
Yet here he is, on a camping trip with the Todoroki family for a full ass week.
Katsuki hates his life.
OR
That one fanfiction in which the Todoroki Family is a disaster and Katsuki regrets his life choices.
