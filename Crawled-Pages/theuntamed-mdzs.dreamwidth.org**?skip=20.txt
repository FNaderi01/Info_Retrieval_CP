Crossover questionSep. 1st, 2020 09:12 pm
dragonyphoenixI'm writing a crossover between The Untamed and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I've noticed that characters in The Untamed have tiles: Zewu Jun, Hanguang-Jun, and even The Ghost General. What I'm wondering is, if Buffy ended up in Cultivation Land (I'm thinking portal), what title would she be given? Thanks!

Taking Chibi art requestsAug. 27th, 2020 10:29 pm
abyss_valkyrieHey guys! I've been really out of creative juice,T_T and I was thinking that maybe drawing some chibi characters could help bring back my muse. Keeping it to single characters only. :) If you want a drawing just comment below with the character's name and if you want them in the drama or donghua design. Give me a prompt if you wish to. Crossover ideas with other fandoms for costumes are also fine.Edit: LMAO!okay,I wasn't expecting that response and I'm honoured! :) I'll set it up for 10 slots for now.1.Geckoholic-LXC-drama-practice- on Twitter 2.Zdenka-NHS-donghua-bird-on Twitter3.Goss-JC-drama-stray puppy4.Kiezh-WWX-drama-Mad scientist5.Forestofglory-WQ-Drama6.Dragonyphoenix-WN-Buffy verse7.Stultiloquentia-Lan Qiren-drama-trying to grow beard8.Ranalore-LWJ-drama-bunnies9.10.

20 Questions Part 1-A MDZS/The Untamed QuizAug. 16th, 2020 08:03 pm
abyss_valkyrieHello,everyone! I suddenly had an idea of making a quiz with 20 questions. I think many of these can be answered even if you've not finished the drama or donghua but hey,it's just a bit of fun. :D I'd love to do another one of these again! Also does anyone have suggestions for tagging this kind of content? Maybe meme: quiz / game?!How this works:* Read the 20 questions under the cut.* Give your answers as a comment to this post.There is a format with the numbers in the textbox below if you want to use.* Don't cheat!* After you're done, check the answers and edit your comment with the score. The answer sheet is linked below.* It's okay to leave out any question if you aren't sure of the answer, remember-this isn't an exam.* Talk to each other in the comments about answers and have fun!Here is the ANSWER SHEET. The answers don't have to be exactly the same as those in the answer sheet. If there are any mistakes in the answer sheet,please let me know.Answer format if you need:1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. ( TWENTY QUESTIONS )

[Fic] The River's GraceJul. 27th, 2020 12:17 pm
branchandrootArc: LodestoneCharacters/Pairings: Jiang Wanyin, Jiang Yanli, Wei Wuxian, Wen Ning, Wen Qing, Wen Qing/Jiang WanyinSummary: Wen Qing isn’t used to being the one protected, but somehow Jiang Yanli keeps managing it. Meta: Drama, Fluff, a touch of Romance, I-3Word Count: 8038They went down the stairs and through two courtyards that looked considerably scruffier and more lived-in than the guest quarter usually did, dark wood rails draped with drying laundry along one side. Jiang sect cultivators frowned at the crimson of her robes, but stepped back out of their way and bowed as Jiang Yanli swept her on by. Wen Qing’s heart clenched with how much it reminded her of Wen cultivators giving way before her as she glared them out of her brother’s path.Read: Ink Burns | AO3

[Fic] Becoming the Phoenix - Eleven (11/11)Jul. 14th, 2020 04:56 pm
branchandrootArc: LodestoneCharacters/Pairings: Lan Wangji, Lan Xichen, Meng Yao, Nie Huaisang, Wei Wuxian, Wen Ning, Wen Qing, Lan Wangji/Wei Wuxian, Lan Xichen/Meng YaoSummary: In the wake of Phoenix Mountain, everyone starts to settle into the futures they’ve found for themselves. Meta: Drama, Romance, Porn, I-4Word Count: 2872“You were right.” His husband smiled at him, soft and rueful. “Mingjue-xiong agrees that it should be me.” And then his smile quirked a little. “So does Pan-guniang, apparently.”“I’m not surprised. She had the very closest of views, of you bringing half the cultivation world to a halt simply by standing and taking no action. Even if she were shaky on her philosophy, that would have been a bit hard to miss.” He laid aside his own papers and reports and crossed the room to kneel by Xichen’s writing table. “Would it make you unhappy, to do this?” If the answer was yes, then he’d find someone else.Read: Ink Burns | AO3

Jin Guangshan is still maneuvering for power, and Meng Yao and Lan Xichen work to stymie him at the Phoenix Mountain night-hunt. In the background, Nie Huaisang plays matchmaker a bit for Jiang Yanli and Jin Zixuan (who needs all the help he can get), and Wei Wuxian has a long-overdue discussion with his brother. Meta: Romance, Drama, Action with some violence, I-4Word Count: 9015Meng Yao was almost, a little bit, starting to sympathize with Lan Qiren on the subject of Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian.Just a little bit.Read: Ink Burns | AO3

[Fic] Becoming the Phoenix - Nine (9/11)Jul. 10th, 2020 04:10 pm
branchandrootArc: LodestoneCharacters/Pairings: Jiang Wanyin, Lan Wangji, Lan Xichen, Meng Yao, Wei Wuxian, Wen Ning, Wen Qing, Lan Wangji/Wei Wuxian, Lan Xichen/Meng YaoSummary: Lan Xichen agrees to bear his (grounded) brother’s invitation to Wei Wuxian. In the course of this, he and Meng Yao figure out at least some of what happened to Wei Wuxian. Meta: Drama, also a dash of Porn, I-3Word Count: 5918“I would like to send an… invitation.”Meng Yao didn’t even need the hesitation over the right term to know who this was about, though he did very privately think that ‘demand’ or possibly ‘kidnapping’ might be closer to what Wangji actually wanted to do. He had not been taking well to the slow pace of Wei Wuxian’s recovery, in Wen Qing’s hands, nor to his own restriction to the Cloud Recesses after his first visit to Lotus Pier had managed to last over two weeks.Read: Ink Burns | AO3

With the campaign over at last, he and Lan Xichen finally have time for ceremonies to formalize their marriage. Nie Huaisang takes a certain glee in assisting. Meta: Drama with even more politics, Romance, Fluff, I-3Word Count: 6199When Xichen told him that there was to be a victory banquet, of all things, organized by Jin Guangshan of course, Meng Yao buried his head in Xichen’s chest and positively whimpered.“Does there have to be a banquet?” he groaned, indulging in the luxury of complaining while he could. He could clearly forsee an evening-long political siege, in this.Read: Ink Burns | AO3
