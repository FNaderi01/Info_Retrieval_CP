    Summary
      He can feel the moment Ben catches sight of the man, buckling under Klaus’ weight with his hands easing their hold of his waist. For a single, breathless second, he fears Ben will drop him, dumbstruck as they both are to see a familiar face in the crowd, but Ben corrects his stance when Klaus begins to tilt dangerously to one side, making a strangled noise similar to a cat getting run over by a truck and saves him from kissing the ground in front of their adoring fans.
Thank fuck for that because people are already whispering, hushed and concerned murmurs breaking out over his near fall, eyeing him with interest and suspicion. 
“What the fuck,” Ben says, more than a little hysterical. “Is that Dad?”
Sure, looks like him, Klaus would’ve liked to answer. Right after, No Shit Ben! Way to point out the obvious.
Because standing in the crowd, donned in a striped suit wearing that glaringly familiar monocle is Sir Hargreeves in person, a glass of Champaign held in his hand. Watching the show unimpressed as always.
Maybe, if they didn’t move or breath, he would go away.

    Summary
      There’s no joy, no relief in his Father’s gaze at seeing him alive, nothing more than the barest flash of interest before his gaze slides away towards the limp figure hanging in Mother’s arms.Instead of the bitter thang of jealousy, fear clogs up Ben’s throat. The movement under his shirt visible for all to see as they tense, restless at the threat to—To what, exactly?The Horror falls silent.“Very well then, Number Six.” Dad turns away. “You may follow along.”In the following time of his resurrection that Klaus sleeps away, Ben gets the chance to give two of his siblings the closure they need.

    Summary
      "What?" Klaus looks down towards his chest and then to Five. "Did I get sun-burnt?" He removes his glasses to check.
Five's eyes remain glued to his chest, face blank.
Weird. There's no sunburn in sight.
Allison wipes her fingers on her towel, ignoring how the sunscreen smears across the fabric to reach for her notepad. Her knuckles are white from the force of her grip and Klaus frowns in concern.
"Klaus..." Vanya chokes out, eyes suspicously shiny. "...your chest."
Klaus tilts his head to the side. "What?"
"The scars," Five takes pity on him and solves the mystery. "Dumbass," he adds on a beat too late.
"Oh," he says, glancing down at the faint pales lines carved into his skin. Allison lays a hand onto his upper arm, rubbing soothing circles with her thumb, prompting him to glance up. "What about them?"
His sisters flinch at his causal tone, sharing a disbelieving glance. 
Or:
Klaus tries to get a tan and forgets that torture left its mark. It's only a matter of time until someone noticed the scars he came to terms with in his time in Vietnam. Understandably, his siblings aren't too happy to not have known their brother got tortured.

    Summary
      "You said you didn't regret it," His voice wavers, the fear and dread churning in his stomach almost coming back up as he tries not to gag. "Just like Dad didn't." It's a low blow, a horrible thing to think let alone say out loud and the last time he'd said it Ben tackled him out of his body in anger. This time Ben shudders. "I didn't–" he says, uncertain and shaky, a whisper of the boy drenched in blood peeking through. "I just wanted...you wouldn't listen." ("I didn't mean to," Six said, wide-eyed and shivering, hands hugging his stomach.) Klaus hides the tears in the crook of Ben's neck and says, "I know." Or, in which the bullet kills Five too, leading to a heart to heart between Four and Six and Klaus Immortality doesn't just extend to himself.

    Summary
      “There’s nothing to tell.”“Liar, liar, pants on fire!” Klaus blocks his attempt of walking past by throwing an arm out and moving into his way. “Is it embarrassing?”“Go away, Klaus,” Diego groans, rubbing at his forehead. Christ, where’s a scary ghost when he needs one? Though, he immediately feels a bit bad for the thought as soon as it crosses his mind.“Not until you tell me.”“Be annoying somewhere else.”“Tell me, tell me, tell meee,” Klaus whines. “Did you fight with Luther again?”“No.”
