Rest in Power #FelycyaHarris ! CW: anti trans violence, murder ! There have been 31 reported murders of trans people in the US this year. This must stop. #blacktranslivesmatter “Felycya Harris, a 33-year-old transgender woman, was found dead of a gunshot wound Saturday in a park in Augusta, Ga. She is the 31st trans American known to have died by violence this year, most of them Black or Latinx women. The number ties the previous high recorded in 2017. Harris’s body was found at Meadowbrook Park shortly after 1 p.m. Saturday, Augusta TV stations WRDW and WAGT report. Police initially called her death suspicious, but Monday the Richmond County coroner classified it as a homicide. Harris was a self-employed interior decorator. "She enjoyed lending her eye to improve the surroundings of others, and made others feel comfortable in their own space,” notes a Human Rights Campaign press release. “She said she could do ‘just about anything with decorating, which she learned from her late grandmother.”“Everybody’s going to remember Felycya,” her friend Ricola Collier told the local TV stations. “That laugh. The smile – the smiles. The talks. The arguments. The attitudes. Everybody is going to remember who Felycya Harris is. Nobody would ever forget who that is.” “With news of the death of Felycya Harris, we have hit a grim milestone: We have now matched the highest number of transgender or gender-nonconforming people who were victims of fatal violence in one year – and there are three more months left in the year,” HRC President Alphonso David said in the press release. “This epidemic of violence, which is particularly impacting transgender women of color, must and can be stopped. We must work to address the factors that underpin this culture of violence and openly discuss how the intersection of racism, sexism, homophobia, biphobia and transphobia work to deprive transgender and gender non-conforming people of equal access to opportunity and necessities like employment, housing and health care.”Via @alokvmenon
