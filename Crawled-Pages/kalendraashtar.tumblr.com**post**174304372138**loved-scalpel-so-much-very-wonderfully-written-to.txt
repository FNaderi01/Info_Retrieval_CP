                            imhereforthestory asked: Loved Scalpel so much! Very wonderfully written to the end. Would there possibly maybe be an epilogue for when he comes home? 😬😬😬😬😬Hello lovely! And thank you 😊. I’m using your ask to elaborate a bit about the ending of 🔪❤️💉 and the future. I knew there would be some questions, given that the finale is rather open-ended and there are lots of unanswered questions. The story I set out to write was the story of a woman at odds with herself, deeply afraid of love, loss and vulnerability; and about a man willing to love her, all the while struggling with real life issues. This tentative tale has, for me, reached a fair ammount of closure when Claire is able to verbalize that she loves Jamie. That final line was my goal from the very start.BUT while I wrote, the story grew with each passing chapter. And I see at least 2-3 possible arcs going forward, that would serve as shortest sequels to the story. However, for a myriad of reasons (most well known by the majority of the people who usually read my blog), I’ve started to debate if I want to keep on writing, and particularly if I want to keep on writing fanfiction. Even if I decide that I actually do, I need a bit of time to heal. This would serve as the intended ending, in case I never will. Morever, most of possible future arcs are controversial (the one I’m more excited about definitely is) and I wanted to give people a “safe” place to stop reading with a sense of satisfaction.So this is where I stand now. We’ll see what the future brings. Xx
