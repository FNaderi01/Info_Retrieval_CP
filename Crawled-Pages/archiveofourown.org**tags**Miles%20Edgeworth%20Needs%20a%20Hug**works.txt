    Summary
      Miles Edgeworth was nine years old when he learned about soulmates. Well, that wasn’t exactly true, he had actually been seven when he asked his father about the topic. It would be more accurate to say that he didn’t understand what having a soulmate truly meant, with all its subtle blessings and burdens, until that fateful autumn day, when the topic had come up in school.AKAI somehow managed to write a fic with the slowest of all slowburns and enough pining to fill a forest. In other words, it's as close to canon Ace Attorney as I could get with a little Soulmate twist.

    Summary
      This story delves into the mystery of where the HELL Maya Fey and Miles Edgeworth were when Phoenix Wright's world collapsed around him post disbarment and WHY they weren't at his side during Phoenix's darkest hour for those long seven years. Join Phoenix, Maya, Miles, Franziska and the rest of your favourite Ace Attorney characters for nearly a decade and experience with them both their laughter and tears, as they discover life's bittersweet truths: sometimes love isn't enough to mean happily ever after, all the money in the world can't necessarily fix all tragedies, justice doesn't always prevail, and broken hearts heal...but can they ever truly mend? Follows the Ace Attorney Timeline for the most part and goes through AJ to Post DD. Slight spoilers for all games. This is the final installment of the Turnabout Lawful Love Trilogy and takes place right where Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman ended. The story starts pre-Apollo Justice, right before Phoenix's disbarment. Official part 3 of the Turnabout Lawful Love Trilogy.

    Summary
      Miles Edgeworth is heir to the throne of the Collar region, an icy deathtrap that thousands call home. However, when his younger brother, Julian, somehow inherits the title of King after their father's tragic death, he becomes power-hungry and psychopathic, running the kingdom with an iron and tyrannical grip. The people aren't happy, and neither is Miles. When Miles meets a strange peasant boy by the name of Phoenix Wright, his whole life gets thrown off course as he finds himself at the heart of a revolution to take Julian out of power and Miles in his place. Will Miles rule the kingdom? If he does, what price will he have to pay to save the kingdom his father loved?

    Summary
      Hello all, it's been awhile since I last posted a fanfic on here, hasn't it? Anyhoo, just felt like sharing a little bit of self-indulgent Edgeworth whump lol. It's the first thing I've written in awhile that I haven't thought was trash haha, and this time it's a sickfic! Poor Edgeworth comes down with the flu and (of course) being the stubborn prick he is refuses to stay home and rest, so it's up to Phoenix and Maya to save the day! Naturally Edgeworth doesn't make it easy though, constantly complaining about not wanting to be "babied" by Wright and his assistant. Will Edgeworth ever learn to loosen up and let others take care of him once in awhile? Probably not!

    Summary
      “I don’t think you should be alone tonight, Edgeworth!”The sudden outburst caught Edgeworth off guard. “Wright, that is hardly your decision to make.”“I… I know, I just,” Wright paused to collect his thoughts. “I am worried about you, Edgeworth. I really am. I think there’s more going on inside your head than you’re letting on. I just… I just wanna help.”“I don’t need your help,” Edgeworth quickly said, before the pain in his chest made him say anything different.Wright looked at him with sad eyes. The ache in Edgeworth’s chest increased. He straightened his back and looked away.-------After the final trial of Turnabout Goodbyes, the DL-6 case is closed once and for all. But Miles Edgeworth is still haunted by guilt and memories of his abusive childhood. Luckily, Phoenix Wright is there to help him, no matter what.(TW: Child abuse, verbal abuse, physical abuse, manipulation, and Manfred von Karma being a horrible person in general as the tags say.)
