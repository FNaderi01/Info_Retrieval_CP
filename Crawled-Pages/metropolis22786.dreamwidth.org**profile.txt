                 Mini Bio
                Black hair, brown eyes, sometimes wears glasses. Sometimes funny, with a side order of snark and heapings of periodic emo. Prone to ranting about the stupidity that exists in this world, with lots of teal deer to be seen and avoided. Irreverent. Thinks there is no such thing as Too Much Information.metropolis_fics is my fic journal.Lives in Reading, UK, and can usually be found lurking around Coffee Corner or my two jobs. I deal poker in a casino, and I work overnights for Hollister.Likes to get seasons of TV shows, and then NEVER WATCH THEM. And is therefore very late to some fandoms. This includes, but is not limited to; Lost, Desperate Housewives, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Transformers, Stargate, Stargate: Atlantis, Stargate: Universe, Dark Angel, Supernatural, Ghost In The Shell, Criminal Minds and Highlander.
