    Summary
      The Blights are a powerful vampire family. All of the Blights but Amity fondly embraces life as a blood drainer, as a stalker of the night, but she still feels guilt, avoiding causing another's death as often as she can. She wrestles between acceptance of what she is and complete suppression of her instincts. She has nearly it all under control until a human arrives at Hexside. A strangely attractive human.TW: violence, domestic abuse, straight people

    Summary
      Witches are pretty wild. Amity has had a lot of experience, but none of it gives her the same thrill that she gets when she engages with Luz in the heat of anger. Luz opens herself to the spicy enemies but secret lovers trope she's dreamed of. However, with an oblivious Luz and a pining Amity struggling with additional feelings, things are sure to be more complicated than simple hatefucking. And what are Boscha and Willow doing, anyway? This fanfiction will follow the series in real time, taking a few creative liberties. I've changed the title because, really, they only hate fucking for about the first five chapters. If you hate the title now, please recommend a new one, because I sometimes suck at naming things.

    Summary
      Luz is a loyal friend. She would do anything to help those whom she loves, even let herself be assaulted. She would even pretend to be okay to make sure no one worries.Amity has a devastating crush. Her worst fear is for someone to reveal it. Actually, her worst fear is for something terrible to happen to her crush in front of her.Willow is the most supportive friend anyone could want. But maybe she ought to tone down the viciousness brewing in her vengeful little heart.And Boscha? Well. Boscha's just a bitch. Let's hope a redemption arc hits her over the head and knocks some sense into her.

    Summary
      After Luz helped Eda escape and got trapped in the Boiling Isles, unrest soon started, as Emperor Belos lost control of the people, and soon a war started. 
Luz, Eda, and Lilith lead a group of rebels ready to overthrow the Emperor and bring peace to the Demon Realm once and for all. The war lasted years, but in the end, they managed to defeat Emperor Belos and free the Isles, but with the cost of many lives.
With the Emperor killing her mother in the war, Luz stayed in the Boiling Isles in Eda's care. She grew up, and the new Mother and Daughter created the Magical Council to rule the Isles in the right way.
In that time, Luz married Amity, and together they had a daughter, Azure. They ruled the Isles with their surviving friends and families for years, in a time of peace.
But danger still lurks, as some of Belos' old followers are still around, and want to bring down the ones that took their Emperor.

Lucky for her, Eda, Willow, Gus, Edric, and Emira help her get back on her feet, and soon Luz is back on her feet, and since no one is pinning her now, Emira asks her out. 
But then Amity manages to break out of the potion, and sees all of the things "she has done" and how the true love of her live is now with her sister.

    Summary
      Okay so I thought it would be cute to give them different names beside Ladybug and Chat Noir.Catarina is Ladybug in Spanish, and Lady Noire means Lady black in French, so that's what I went with.This is a Miraculous Ladybug/ Owl House crossover.It's pretty crazy that this idea hasn't been used yet, I checked and check and yet I am the first! The first chapter will show who will be playing what role.The second chapter will be new information that's way different than in the original miraculous.Since there's currently only 11 episodes of Owl House out I don't know all the characters that will be in the show so I only used the ones I know, and I either used the actual characters or someone I make up for the rest.Since this is Miraculous Ladybug and not Owl House the characters will actually be different. I will probably develop and make them different than how they will turn out in the show. Obviously this won't be just like Miraculous, but I hope you can still enjoy it!(Edit: Since I haven’t gone too in depth yet, since I only just finished the origin story, I’m going to edit the character list and stuff up from ep 13.)

    Creator Chose Not To Use Archive WarningsBoscha/Amity Blight (unrequited) Amity Blight/Luz Noceda Amity Blight &amp; Willow Park Amity Blight &amp; BoschaBoscha (The Owl House) Willow Park Amity Blight Luz Noceda Skara (The Owl House)I don't even like Boscha why did I write this idk man she and amity's relationship interests me so there's that this is dedicated to my discord (father) Blu who is the only one I know who still loves Boscha good on ya Blu Boscha's character changes every time I write her lmao
    Summary
      Boscha knows Amity, all right? She’s her best friend. Even if Amity doesn’t ever really start their conversations, or ever seeks her out on her own, or really tries to spend time with her. They’re best friends, okay? Certainly better friends than Amity had been with Half-A-Witch-Willow. 
Or
Boscha’s adventures in pining for someone when that person doesn’t really exist.
