This year’s election is history in the making. According to state officials, California’s Tuesday primary election has encouraged nearly 18 million people to register to vote. Resulting in an increase in the number of Democratic, Republican and nonpartisan groups.
Experts predict this year, two-thirds of voters will cast votes by mail.
Aside from the influx in the number of voters in this year’s primary election, history is also being made by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and U.S Senator candidate Kamala D. Harris.

Allowing a major win for presumptive presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in California, New Jersey, South Dakota and New Mexico. Not only is Clinton the first woman to land a spot on a major party ballot but she is also on her way to becoming the first female president of the United States.
“First time in our nation’s history that a woman will be a major party nominee. Tonight victory is not about one person it belongs to generations of women and men who made this moment possible,” said Clinton.
The U.S. Secretary of State and presidential candidate received the 2,383 delegates which also happens to be the amount needed to secure her nomination against opposing presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders.

“I am running for the United States Senate because I love my state. I am a proud daughter of California, and I believe Californians want their next United States senator to be someone who knows how to get things done,” Harris said.
If elected, Harris will be the second African American woman and the first Indian woman to hold a seat in the Senate.
