    Summary
      "Kill the king and I'll protect you." he'd said and Chuuya knew that hadn't been a lie. It hadn't been a lie, but the Demon hadn't fully believed it would come to the point when he'd have to hold his end of the bargain either. He expected him to fail. 
"How much are you prepared to sacrifice for freedom?" he'd asked, and Chuuya knew that what he was actually asking was; are you prepared to die for it? And yes, yes he was.
So that had been that.
