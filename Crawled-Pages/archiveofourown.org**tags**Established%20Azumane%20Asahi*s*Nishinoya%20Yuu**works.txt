    Summary
      Karasuno High School was formally two different schools, one reknown for the heroes that graduated from there, the other for the old powerhouse volleyball team. Both schools had converged several years ago. But, this year comes with a surprise, a group of 30 students facing unmanageable odds. On one hand, the class faces off with villans, protecting innocent lives along with themselves. The other, rebuilding the volleyball team, of which 10 participate in. That's what happens when you have 7 members of a particular family in one school, a fun-filled chaotic year.

    Summary
      hinata shouyou has made the three by far biggest mistakes of his life1. inviting the volleygays into one groupchat2. putting bokuto, kuroo, matsukawa, and hanamaki into said groupchat3. also adding iwaizumi hajime into that same groupchathe will probably never have a good night's rest because they cannot shut up, and kageyama wont either.hinata shouyou regrets making this group chat

    Summary
      Sugawara has several problems right now; Choices to make, and places to be. The best thing for him right now would be a nice, long vacation, which his friends unknowingly give him by inviting Suga to a wedding 11,697 kilometers away from Tokyo. Across the continent of North America and then some, landing in Orlando, Florida. But feelings, problems, and a whole lot of memories resurface as soon as he sees the one thing he'd been trying to forget for 5 years.Sawamura Daichi.Alternative title: Fellas, is it gay to see your friend after five years and fall in love all over again?.inspired by this fic by the lovely h_lovely !

    Summary
      Karasuno had stayed a team long after they all had graduated from the high school, keeping up through social media and brunch when it worked for everyone. Sometimes they'd even spend the night all at someone's house, playing Uno until god knows what hour, dancing like no one was watching, and just having a good time. When Koushi finds out that he's having a baby, he decides that he needs his team again - so he and Daichi team up to figure out just what to do. And, hopefully, nothing too bad will happen.

    Summary
      They’re Kageyama and Hinata—Tobio and Shoyo. They’re the freak duo. They’re them—together and separate and entirely connected. They’re shared glances and brain cells and small laughs and awkward smiles. They’re flushed cheeks and soft presses of kisses on warm flesh.
Hinata’s bright and loud and concentrated.
And Kageyama—Kageyama’s cold.
