    Summary
      Avatar AU where everything is the same except the war never happened. Sozin was gonna use the comet to start the war but Roku visited him in a dream and was like 'you better not or I swear you'll regret it'. Plot; When one of Ozai's children runs away with knowledge that could wreck everything he has in store, Ozai hires some of the best benders in the world to go after him. The group includes the Avatar(who recently was freed from an iceberg he'd been stuck in for a 100 years and now lives with the rest of the monks up in the temples), The Blind Bandit(The best earthbender there is), The worlds best waterbending prodigy(Her brother insisted he come along as well, and he wasn't bad with a sword). Ozai sends his daughter to lead the team. However, when they find Zuko and learn of Ozai's secret plan, they all grudgingly band together to take him down and put one of the fire nation siblings on the throne.  (Sorry for the awful description, the story will be much better I swear)

The Gaang promptly adopt and raise the sibling duo, because why not? They can’t be any worse than Ozai.Starring Zuko as a precious cinnamon roll, Azula as a holy terror, Katara as the best mom and the only reason these kids aren’t going to end up scarred for life, Aang as an overeager dad who spoils the children, Sokka as the weird uncle whose jokes might end up giving the siblings brain damage, Suki as the cool aunt, and Toph as Toph.
