    Chapter Text
    Josuke doesn’t know  what  just happened. It seems as if  everyone  is here, even though he was only dealing with just a delinquent. How did it turn out like this, everyone on the cusp of death????  Blood is everywhere, Josuke doesn’t even remember the fight getting this bad! - Jotaro Kujo woke up at 7:15am October to a frantic call from Josuke. Apparently, he had been jumped by a delinquent, but when it was obvious they wouldn’t win, they called in more backup. Unfortunately, their backup included stands.   They were a lot more prepared than Josuke had expected. Meaning, Jotaro was a much-needed help. The stand users were very powerful and combined with the lots of them, it was going to be hard to win.   Meanwhile:  ---- It was already 7:30 and Josuke hadn’t shown up at school. It was even more worrisome that he wasn’t home when Okuyasu and Koichi went by so they could walk to school together.   “Maybe he just skipped.” Yukako suggests over to Okuyasu.   “He woulda told me! He always does!”   “Maybe he didn’t this time...” supplies Koichi.   “No! I know my best bro, something had to have happened!”   “He could’ve woken up late. Look, just because he’s not at school doesn’t mean something happened to him.” Yukako replies. “It doesn’t always have to be an enemy stand user you know!”  “Fine then! I’m going to look for him whether you’re commin or not!”   Okuyasu is almost out the door when Koichi stops him.   “We’ll go with you.”  - For the students, it is an unwelcoming surprise to see Josuke fighting a lot of punks alongside Jotaro, and it seems that they were  losing .  The group immediately goes into assist when they get close, looking to provide any support they could.  “Damnit, Snail! You didn’t tell us there would be more backup!” says a woman, presumably to the leader.   “We didn’t plan for this, Vio! Though, this just might make it more interesting...”    Both of them got their stands out and targeted the three new students. Josuke saw this and dived to block the attack, but he got knocked aside by another delinquent, rendering him unconscious. Soon, the other three follow suit and all four are face down on the pavement. ---- At 7:35am, Rohan’s walking around town when he hears what sounds to be a fight going on. Lucky him, he was having a bit of a writer’s block issue and needed some more manga material!   Once reaching the alleyway the fight was taking place, Rohan’s eyes went wide. Higashikata, Yamagishi, Nijimura, and Koichi were knocked out on the pavement. His eyes dart upwards to see Jotaro struggling to block the enemy’s attacks.  He summons Heaven’s door, and immediately, he’s hit from behind, falling onto the ground.  ---- Everyone was knocked out except for Kujo. The unexpected 4 were swiftly taken care of along with Josuke, which meant Jotaro had no reliable help.   “Vio! Keep Kujo distracted.”   “Got it!”   Snail seemingly disappears, and Vio keeps attacking.   ...   One blow to the head is seemingly all it takes to take down the great and mighty Kujo Jotaro.   “Nice work Vio. You too, Mayo and Danny.”   “I didn’t expect them to put up that much of a fight, so I’m glad we could get them down.” Mayo tells Snail.   “Should we proceed with the plan?” Asks Danny.  “Yes.” Vio and Snail reply in unison. - It doesn’t matter. He doesn’t need to think back on how everything went wrong. He doesn’t need to think about how he  failed  everyone. He just needs to heal and make up for it (that’s all he was good for, anyways).   Josuke got a lot of damage done to him in the fight, so he isn’t in the best condition to heal, but he is in the best shape out of all of them.   He gets up and goes over to the person closest to him, Yukako. It takes too long to get there, but he pushes through the pain as he reaches her. Crazy Diamond, while not fully manifested, can still heal pretty quickly, so that’s a good thing. As soon as he walks over to Koichi, however, he feels his legs almost give out.   Yukako must’ve been more hurt than he originally thought.   No matter what though, he can push through this too. His pain probably doesn’t even come close to what everyone else is feeling.    Koichi is healed and Josuke can barely find it in himself to stand up, let alone walk. He swallows his dignity (if there was any) and crawls to Okuyasu.    Right as he starts healing his friend, he feels something wet run down next to- no,  on  his lip. He feels it and pulls back to see what was dripping and- oh.    He has a nosebleed.   It doesn’t matter. So, what if it was a nosebleed? Everyone else was hurt far worse than he was.  He finishes healing Okuyasu and not even Crazy Diamond looks good. Sure, he wasn’t fully manifested before, but it is almost impossible to see him now.   No, he can’t give up. Rohan and Jotaro still need to be healed.    Josuke mustered up all the strength he could and –miraculously- is able to reach Rohan  and  summon his stand.    When he heals Rohan, the nosebleed gets worse. Blood is getting  everywhere , which includes Rohan’s expensive clothing.   Rohan’s going to kill me for this...    Josuke starts to feel a bit loopy. His head is spinning, and black dots stalk the corners of his vision.   He pushes onward, though. The pain is starting to get to him, adrenaline from the fight wearing off.    He can handle it, he can handle it, he can make it to Jotaro in time,  he can handle it-    Josuke finishes healing his nephew, the time between healing Rohan and Jotaro almost non-existent for him, and he faints immediately after, not noticing the red starting to seep from the top of his head.  --- Everyone awakes to a horrific site. At first, nobody is confused as to  why  they are healed, but rather, why they have  blood  on them, specifically Okuyasu, Rohan, and Jotaro.    That’s when they spot the unconscious, face down, not-so fluffy haired child on the ground next to his nephew.   Immediately, Jotaro turns him onto his back and –oh god. There’s blood  everywhere. When they were fighting, Josuke was the least hurt (thankfully), so how did he end up like this?   It doesn’t matter, no time for questions.   They have a child to save.      Unfortunately for them, by the time they reached Josuke, his heart had stopped beating a few minutes ago.

          Can you spot the RWCW server cameos? There are a few others in previous stories, and there are more to come!---Gold my beta reader added while beta-ing:“Jotaro is getting his ass whooped by two scrawny fan-fic writers”“By the power of fanfic, you will feel pain one way or another!”"Just In: Twink fan-fic writeres beat up local ocean man"
