                                                                        dreamlogic

His initiation was much the same; he’s dead certain that they just gave him a robe and made him part of the ceremony to “feel included”. And he’s super touched by the way they keep inviting him to those meetings and even seem interested in what he has to say! Sometimes (a lot of times, actually, but he doesn’t even notice that) they even use his ideas!They’re really cool people, those White Lotus guys. Sokka thinks it would be pretty awesome to be a part of their group.

In which case this isn’t going to be of much use to you, but still. Just in case it is. :)

Like there’s tons of videos and pics of Spider-Man because Miles is a personable kid and then there’s these cryptid like sightings of Prowler coming out of nowhere to save Miles’ ass. Like shaky cam video of Goblin kicking Spidey around and then out of nowhere tHERE’S A MOTORCYCLE FLYING INTO GOBLIN’S FACE. The camera swings around only to see the flare of a cape and Spidey is nowhere to be seen.
