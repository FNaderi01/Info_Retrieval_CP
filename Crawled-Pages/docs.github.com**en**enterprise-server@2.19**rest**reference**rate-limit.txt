      The REST API overview documentation describes the rate limit rules. You can check your current rate limit status at any time using the Rate Limit API described below.
Understanding your rate limit status
The Search API has a custom rate limit, separate from the rate limit governing the rest of the REST API. The GraphQL API also has a custom rate limit that is separate from and calculated differently than rate limits in the REST API.
For these reasons, the Rate Limit API response categorizes your rate limit. Under resources, you'll see four
objects:
The core object provides your rate limit status for all non-search-related resources in the REST API.
The search object provides your rate limit status for the Search API.
The graphql object provides your rate limit status for the GraphQL API.
The integration_manifest object provides your rate limit status for the GitHub App Manifest code conversion endpoint.
For more information on the headers and values in the rate limit response, see "Rate limiting."
      Get rate limit status for the authenticated user
    Note: Accessing this endpoint does not count against your REST API rate limit.
Note: The rate object is deprecated. If you're writing new API client code or updating existing code, you should use the core object instead of the rate object. The core object contains the same information that is present in the rate object.
