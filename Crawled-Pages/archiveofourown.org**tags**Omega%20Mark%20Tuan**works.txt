    Summary
      Jimin and Yoongi are alphas who are known as one of the top couples of campus, even though Yoongi graduated the previous year. Not just because of their looks and talent, but because they are an alpha couple who don’t see a need to have an omega. Don’t get them wrong, they don’t look down on omega’s; they have many friends of all secondary genders, they just don’t feel a need to have an omega in their relationship. They do occasionally like to play, but there has never been an omega they've wanted to play with.Then walks in, Namjoon; someone who peeks both of their interests. Unfortunately he's related to one of their good friends and they don't want to cause any issues so they tease and look from afar and up close. But don't touch.Namjoon has just gotten to town, met not one but two alpha's that spark his interest. The issue is that they are boyfriends. Have been for years. There's no room for him and he would never try come between two people. So he'll look from afar and sometimes up close.

    Summary
      Even though I wanted to confess to you my feelings I knew it was neither the time nor place for it. Besides, you already had someone and you would’ve just given me that warm smile and told me it was just some teenage crush. But as I stand in front of you many years later, I find my heart still beating for you like it never stopped since the first time I met you…

    Summary
      If you'd asked beautiful omega Min Jimin, who'd relocated to the Jeon Village to reunite with his beloved brother, if he ever expected to cry over a wonderful but ultimately unobtainable alpha, he would've vehemently denied it.More importantly, he would've never dreamt that this alpha actually loves him back.A story of brotherhood, friendship, Yeontan, and, most importantly of all, requited love.

    Summary
      Mark always wanted to be free. He wanted to forget about his past and start over in a new country with new people. None of his plans involved falling in love with an alpha though. And they definitely didn't include falling in love with more than one person.
