It’s basically: is hot, is nice to him, unrelated, carries some form of political clout. Jiang Cheng hits like, three and a half of those.cqlfeelsYeah, I mean… The only thing that could trip then up is whether JC is nice to him, but consider:JC: Can you hold A-Ling while I go torture the demonic cultivator du jour?

No, he’s our son.A whole new world just opened up for him. There’s nothing else on his mind. Head empty just how do I ask my not-really-even-friend-anymore with whom I am most deeply in love and who is currently being hunted down if I can adopt his son so we can raise him together?Like, seriously, I cant handle this! Five minutes ago he had no idea he wanted to be a parent and now he’s imagining his future raising this child with wwx. Life sure is unpredictable.The betrayal! He can’t believe wwx would do this. Wei Ying, this is NOT how we are going to raise our son. If you ask him which toy he likes best, you have to buy it for him. How can you be so heartless? We will have to have a conversation about this. For now I hope my glare conveys that this CANNOT happen again.This is all he has ever wanted, to be hugged by his son with wwx as co-parent.Obviously, we all know that he doesn’t get exactly that. he has to raise a-Yuan alone, and does an exceptional job, because he is a great dad and Lan Sizhui is the best boy.But then we have the other moment when he meets Mianmian’s daughter.He is so soft, he has such a soft spot for children. He just starts fantasizing about being a dad again.I can tell you are being adorable again Wei Ying but I am too busy choosing the name of our future child.They act like a married couple. Wei Ying is right in assuming that he can promise my money, everything I own is yours Wei Ying. And I am very glad my glare all those years ago worked. When you make a promise to a child you have to keep it.This is too much. Wei Ying pouting so adorably in front of a little girl sure can’t be allowed. There has to be some rule about this. Wait, does this mean that I might see this all the time now I’ve decided we will raise a child? This time we might actually be able to raise a child together.They are both amazing parents but i just love that every time lwj sees a child near wwx he just decides that they will be dads together. He can’t help it.and there you have itlan wangjiwei wuxiana-yuanwangxianthe untamedSource:manhasetardisthedoubteriswiseSaturday, September 05, 2020 with 1,767 notesthedoubteriswiseokay so.

Time has moved on and other great players have popped onto the scene, but the Pens’ center duo have remained as super top-end players that have remained two of the very best centers in the game. Advanced stats continue to backup what has been apparent on the ice with Pittsburgh making the playoffs every season of Malkin’s career, these two are the offensive engines that fuel a strong team.
