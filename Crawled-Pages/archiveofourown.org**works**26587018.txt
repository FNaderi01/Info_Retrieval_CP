    Summary
      After narrowly subverting the apocalypse, life returns to normal for the Hargreeves family. Unfortunately, this peace doesn't last long after Five follows Diego on a routine night mission that goes sideways in the worst way. The dysfunctional super siblings must now work as a team to try and put the pieces of their smallest member back together before he shatters completely beyond repair.
