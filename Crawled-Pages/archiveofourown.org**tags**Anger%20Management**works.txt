    Summary
      Draco twisted it between his fingers... back and forth. The metal wasn’t particularly unique in appearance, it was actually rather plain. Yet, the piece had been discovered in the corpse of Hogwarts. Amongst the ruins of his former house, in the dungeons. It bore his family crest. Curious. No jewels adorning it, one of the many faceless minions brought it to him hoping for favor. Everyone recognized the Malfoy crest, feared it. He glanced briefly at the crumpled mass bleeding out on his floor, smirking. Favor indeed. He would need to refer to his father, ask what he knew. How had it been buried there? Who’s had it been? He sensed power pulsing. Curious. His mind wandered back to the blood and smoke of that final battle, the day the Dark Lord rose and conquered... the day hope died. The day many good men, women, and child soldiers fell... that Harry Potter was frozen within Amber... when Granger vanished. Most believed she was dead, but years later, Draco somehow knew she was alive and kicking somewhere. He’d keep orders current for her capture, to be brought directly to him. She’d be alone now... he almost pitied the survivors. His own guilt ate at him enough. The silver almost felt warm.

    Summary
      Misako and Kyokō have always looked out for each other on the rough streets of Derdriu since as long as they can remember.  Sure, they might be orphans, but their wise old dojo master Abobo has done his best to give the wild pair a modicum of culture and discipline.  While strolling the docks with their signature knucks and kanabō, they see a brown skinned youth in fancy yellow clothing being bullied by the local press gang.  More than anything else, Misako and Kyokō hate bullies...because that’s THEIR job! 
The youth’s name happens to be Claude von Riegan…
Soon the Garreg Mach Officer's Academy will have two new commoner students:  The Aquatic City Girls!

    Summary
      And now, in a different world, in a different time, Father was smiling. Mordred saw it often, when he was near the woman with the white hair and the red eyes, when he was sparring with Diarmuid, when he was talking with the Archer in red, when he was near any of the other Knights that had been summoned to Chaldea. Father was happy, and Mordred . . . was happy too. Or at least he should have been, because this was his wish, wasn’t it? But he couldn’t be happy, because Father wasn’t happy around him. And Mordred wanted to scream, to rage and yell, because every time Father’s smile slid off his face at the sight of the Knight of Rebellion, Mordred was transported back to that room, his news ringing in the air, his father’s indifference. Shouldn’t he have been happy too? Finally, it didn’t matter if Guinevere hadn’t produced a child, Mordred was his son! He had an heir! But his father hadn’t been happy, hadn’t even looked at him, and all the delight in Mordred’s heart had turned into hatred so great it choked off all logical thought.He thought he was better, he thought understanding what he wanted would help change that.But now, Father was happy and smiling, and Mordred . . .Mordred was not.

    Summary
      "The heart monitors practically trumpeted in his ears as he descended into the room, Roger was sleeping with his head lazily slack to the side but he didn't look peaceful. The sight of the man who used to be so close to him was shocking, and nearly brought tears to his eyes. Roger was thin and pale, dark circles consuming his eyes cruelly. His body was covered in deep purple and green bruises along with fresh blood-soaked bandages cloaking his arms and torso. The young man had discarded his gown earlier in the visit, which exposed his damaged body further." It's been nearly five years since Brian and Roger have seen each other but when Roger jumps from a bridge, Brian rushes to his side to be his support. When Roger moves in with Brian and his roommates Freddie and John, Brian realizes it's not nearly as easy as he thought to take care of someone who needs it most.Or, Brian and Roger learn to love each other again and Roger learns how to live

    Summary
      It's the end of a long, brutal and unsuccessful military campaign in the Mortal Realm. Ares is exhausted, frustrated, and longs to be back with Aphrodite and his children. But the Ares that comes back to Olympus isn't himself. His family find themselves dealing with the aftermath of defeat, and Ares needs them now more than ever.[This story takes place following a war, but is in no way meant to be a portrayal of the veteran experience or PTSD. Rather, it aims to take the tension between Ares' work and home life as the setting for his struggles with self-worth, self-understanding, and anger management. I wanted to look into the darker side of his inner world, and the potential problems it could create for him and those he loves. This fic does therefore deal with battles with mental health, as well as some frustration from a loving family who doesn't see the whole picture yet. But it is also about healing and learning to trust yourself and your loved ones. The boy's gonna be OK. Only chapters 2, 5 and 10-12 have smut, but I've marked it explicit and leaned into the porn tags because Ares' sexual relationship with Aphrodite is such a key theme and the core element of his healing. Wound description in Chapters 1 and 3.]
