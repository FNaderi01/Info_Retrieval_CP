It’s not that I don’t appreciate getting out of jail, I just can’t live my life a fugitive.Nate: But you’re not a fugitive–Parker: Passports, money, lockpicks…Nate: You were released not broken out.Parker: Toothpaste… Explosives.

so it’s like this, see:Steve Rogers is as Muggleborn as they come. He’s been friends with Bucky Barnes for his entire life, and Bucky’s ma was always so much better at getting the bloodstains out of Steve’s shirts, at patching him up. Steve’s never suspected there’s something different about her, about Bucky, about him.Except that Buck’s never been terribly good at keeping secrets.They’re eight when Bucky tells Steve about magic.And when they both get their letters, Bucky figures they’re both going to be in Gryffindor. Steve’s all noble and that, and Bucky doesn’t figure he’s smart or cunning or kind enough to go anywhere else.(on the train, though, Steve outright lies to a bunch of fourth-year Slytherins who ask him, sneeringly, if he’s Muggleborn. And yes, he’s certainly thinking that he doesn’t like bullies, but he’s also thinking I’ll show them that blood doesn’t matter. Size doesn’t matter. I’ll be the best wizard in our year and that’ll show them.)So the Sorting Hat sees that, and puts Steve right in Slytherin.And Bucky–well, the Hat sees the little boy who befriended the skinny, sickly kid, the boy who offered that friend a home when his folks died, sees the loyalty Bucky feels to Steve and says, well, better put you in Hufflepuff.(Bucky is ecstatic, if a little sad that he and Steve won’t be in the same dorm)(it’s okay though. He meets an awful nice Hufflepuff second-year named Angie who says she sneaks into Slytherin all the time to visit her friend Peg)Two years later, on the train to Hogwarts, Bucky and Steve see a commotion that turns into a scuffle that’s going to turn into a fistfight if they don’t stop it. Bucky’s big for his age, so he usually gets called to separate fights. By the time they get there a first year has punched a third year. The third year–a Ravenclaw named Whitney–has blood all down her robes and what Bucky guesses is a broken nose.The culprit is a tiny girl with dark hair and wide blue eyes who doesn’t look like she’d be able to do that much damage to someone a good foot taller than her. “All I did was say that her father was a no good blood traitor–” Whitney starts, and the first year makes another lunge for her. Bucky catches the first-year ‘round the waist and hauls her over his shoulder so she can’t make another go at Frost. (Bucky doesn’t know it now, but catching this girl and hauling her away from a fight is something he’ll be doing often in the coming years. All he can say about it is that at least Steve is getting better at picking his fights, so Bucky has to do this a lot less with him)“–and a Death Eater!” Whitney finishes.“Well,” the first-year says from her perch over Bucky’s shoulder, sniffing with disdain. “That part’s true.”“I meant it as a compliment!”“Well I didn’t want it as a compliment!” The first year lunges so violently she almost topples out of Bucky’s grasp. “And you insulted my mother!”Finally, Steve has the sense to shove Whitney out of the train compartment and slam the door shut.“So,” Bucky says after a very long period of silence. “You wanna tell us what that was all about?”The girl is sniffling very hard and very conspicuously trying not to cry. “She was insulting my mum. Just because she was Muggleborn.”“Hey!” The compartment door slams open again. “Did a first year punch Whitney Frost in the face?”The girl scowls. “Yeah. Why?”Tony Stark elbows past Steve and Bucky. Even for a fourth year, he’s short, but his personality more than makes up for it. “What’s your name, kid?”“‘m not a kid. And I’m Kate. Kate Bishop.”“Didn’t your dad just get thrown in Azkaban?” Tony says, forgoing tact as he usually does. “Bum luck, kid.”“He deserved it,” she scowls. “He’s a bad person. And I’m not like him.”Steve and Tony and Bucky exchange looks.“Any enemy of Whitney Frost’s is a friend of mine. Anyone gives you trouble, send them to me. I’ll set them straight.” Tony offers his hand to Kate, and they shake.(Bucky isn’t surprised when she’s sorted into Slytherin. She’s got a lot she wants to prove, it seems.)(within a few days, Kate befriends an equally broody and sullen Gryffindor first-year named Eli. They’re constantly getting detention for bullying bullies. Nobody wants to say they’re vigilantes, because they’re eleven, but. Well. Slytherin’s prefect, Matt Murdock, finds this hilarious. Karen Page, the Gryffindor Prefect, less so.)
