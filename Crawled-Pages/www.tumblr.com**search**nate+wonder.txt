so it‚Äôs like this, see:Steve Rogers is as Muggleborn as they come. He‚Äôs been friends with Bucky Barnes for his entire life, and Bucky‚Äôs ma was always so much better at getting the bloodstains out of Steve‚Äôs shirts, at patching him up. Steve‚Äôs never suspected there‚Äôs something different about her, about Bucky, about him.Except that Buck‚Äôs never been terribly good at keeping secrets.They‚Äôre eight when Bucky tells Steve about magic.And when they both get their letters, Bucky figures they‚Äôre both going to be in Gryffindor. Steve‚Äôs all noble and that, and Bucky doesn‚Äôt figure he‚Äôs smart or cunning or kind enough to go anywhere else.(on the train, though, Steve outright lies to a bunch of fourth-year Slytherins who ask him, sneeringly, if he‚Äôs Muggleborn. And yes, he‚Äôs certainly thinking that he doesn‚Äôt like bullies, but he‚Äôs also thinking I‚Äôll show them that blood doesn‚Äôt matter. Size doesn‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôll be the best wizard in our year and that‚Äôll show them.)So the Sorting Hat sees that, and puts Steve right in Slytherin.And Bucky‚Äìwell, the Hat sees the little boy who befriended the skinny, sickly kid, the boy who offered that friend a home when his folks died, sees the loyalty Bucky feels to Steve and says, well, better put you in Hufflepuff.(Bucky is ecstatic, if a little sad that he and Steve won‚Äôt be in the same dorm)(it‚Äôs okay though. He meets an awful nice Hufflepuff second-year named Angie who says she sneaks into Slytherin all the time to visit her friend Peg)Two years later, on the train to Hogwarts, Bucky and Steve see a commotion that turns into a scuffle that‚Äôs going to turn into a fistfight if they don‚Äôt stop it. Bucky‚Äôs big for his age, so he usually gets called to separate fights.¬†By the time they get there a first year has punched a third year. The third year‚Äìa Ravenclaw named Whitney‚Äìhas blood all down her robes and what Bucky guesses is a broken nose.The culprit is a tiny girl with dark hair and wide blue eyes who doesn‚Äôt look like she‚Äôd be able to do that much damage to someone a good foot taller than her.¬†‚ÄúAll I did was say that her father was a no good blood traitor‚Äì‚Äù Whitney starts, and the first year makes another lunge for her. Bucky catches the first-year ‚Äòround the waist and hauls her over his shoulder so she can‚Äôt make another go at Frost. (Bucky doesn‚Äôt know it now, but catching this girl and hauling her away from a fight is something he‚Äôll be doing often in the coming years. All he can say about it is that at least Steve is getting better at picking his fights, so Bucky has to do this a lot less with him)‚Äú‚Äìand a Death Eater!‚Äù Whitney finishes.‚ÄúWell,‚Äù the first-year says from her perch over Bucky‚Äôs shoulder, sniffing with disdain.¬†‚ÄúThat part‚Äôs true.‚Äù‚ÄúI meant it as a compliment!‚Äù‚ÄúWell I didn‚Äôt want it as a compliment!‚Äù The first year lunges so violently she almost topples out of Bucky‚Äôs grasp.¬†‚ÄúAnd you insulted my mother!‚ÄùFinally, Steve has the sense to shove Whitney out of the train compartment and slam the door shut.‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Bucky says after a very long period of silence.¬†‚ÄúYou wanna tell us what that was all about?‚ÄùThe girl is sniffling very hard and very conspicuously trying not to cry.¬†‚ÄúShe was insulting my mum. Just because she was Muggleborn.‚Äù‚ÄúHey!‚Äù The compartment door slams open again.¬†‚ÄúDid a first year punch Whitney Frost in the face?‚ÄùThe girl scowls.¬†‚ÄúYeah. Why?‚ÄùTony Stark elbows past Steve and Bucky. Even for a fourth year, he‚Äôs short, but his personality more than makes up for it.¬†‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name, kid?‚Äù‚Äú‚Äòm not a kid. And I‚Äôm Kate. Kate Bishop.‚Äù‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt your dad just get thrown in Azkaban?‚Äù Tony says, forgoing tact as he usually does.¬†‚ÄúBum luck, kid.‚Äù‚ÄúHe deserved it,‚Äù she scowls.¬†‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a bad person. And I‚Äôm not like him.‚ÄùSteve and Tony and Bucky exchange looks.‚ÄúAny enemy of Whitney Frost‚Äôs is a friend of mine. Anyone gives you trouble, send them to me. I‚Äôll set them straight.‚Äù Tony offers his hand to Kate, and they shake.(Bucky isn‚Äôt surprised when she‚Äôs sorted into Slytherin. She‚Äôs got a lot she wants to prove, it seems.)(within a few days, Kate befriends an equally broody and sullen Gryffindor first-year named Eli. They‚Äôre constantly getting detention for bullying bullies. Nobody wants to say they‚Äôre vigilantes, because they‚Äôre eleven, but. Well. Slytherin‚Äôs prefect, Matt Murdock, finds this hilarious. Karen Page, the Gryffindor Prefect, less so.)
