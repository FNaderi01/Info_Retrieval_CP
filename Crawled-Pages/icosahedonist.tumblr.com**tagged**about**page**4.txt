And also there was a bit during that where I did take off a dock jacket and threw it behind me and it landed on the prong of a railing as I walked down the street, which I was terribly pleased with. And yet - cutting room floor. So I’m hoping that would be on the DVD release. Because, frankly, I deserve it. :) (x)fuckyeahgoodomensFrom what I’ve read this scene indeed is on the DVD! :)ineffable-humanPardon the terrible quality my computer hates me but yeah it isfuckyeahgoodomensTHANK YOU ❤
