    Summary
      Work in process of a rewrite.
This is my take on an Undertale AU, this is VirusFell. This takes place in a Post-UnderFell Pacifist route and after 7 years of peacefully living on the surface, a virus is released onto the public by a group of Anti-Monster terrorist but the virus backfires and starts to infect humans instead. Those that are infected grow insane and start to turn into black melted creatures with a lust for blood and dust. With some help of a being from the Void, can Frisk and the gang save those that uninfected or even more so find a cure?

      With each death the darkness grows, consuming and twisting a lost soul that is torn from betrayal.Why does this seem so familiar? These dreams feel so real...Are they dreams or perhaps they are memories of another life? Another timeline?Two voices call out to the lost soul... One offers help, all they want is to be friends.The other, a weaken whisper that longs to be heard. Everyone lies, betrayal runs deep.Who to trust when both voices lie? Another soul tired but refuses to give up, for he knows what will happen if he does."i wasn't ready for this responsibility... but darling... you didn't give me much a choice..."He says as he raises his bony hand, a faint purple aura around it.
