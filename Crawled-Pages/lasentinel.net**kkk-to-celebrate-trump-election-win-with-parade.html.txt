KKK to celebrate Trump election win with parade              
				By Kimberlee Buck, Contributing Writer

Tuesday, November 8th President elect Donald Trump beat Secretary Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Presidential election. For the past five days, protests and riots have erupted in states across the U.S.
Protesters gathered outside of Trump hotels, freeways and outside of classrooms with anger and heartbreak as they hit the streets to protest, chanting, “She won more votes.” In reference to Clinton winning the popular vote.
Since the election has come to an end, petitions have launched on the internet and social media asking the Electoral College to make Hillary Clinton President on December 19th.
        ADVERTISEMENT        
As of Thursday, November 17 the petition has reached 4,403,802 supporters.
“Mr. Trump is unfit to serve. His scapegoating of so many Americans, and his impulsivity, bullying, lying, admitted history of sexual assault, and utter lack of experience make him a danger to the Republic,” said the petition by Change.org. “The Electoral College can actually give the White House to either candidate. So why not use this most undemocratic of our institutions to ensure a democratic result?”

Although the Electoral College has the ability to cast their votes for Secretary Clinton, it is unlikely that the petition will motivate them to do so.
Since the election, America has been divided. Some are upset about the outcome of the election, while others are celebrating.
Earlier last week, one of the largest Ku Klux Klan groups in the country the Loyal White Knights of Pelham, N.C. announced a, “Victory Klavalkade Klan Parade” to celebrate Trump’s move to the White House.
The parade is set to take place on December 3. As of press time, no time or location has been announced.
The website states,” TRUMP = TRUMP’S RACE UNITED MY PEOPLE.”
During the election, several KKK groups and prominent white nationalists openly endorsed Trump.
The Trump campaign denies any ties with the groups.
“I don’t know anything about what you’re talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists,” said Trump. “So I don’t know. I know nothing about David Duke; I know nothing about white supremacists.”
In an interview with the Washington Post, national organizer for the Knights Party Rachel Pendergraft stated Trump’s campaign offered the Knights, a new outreach tool to help recruit new members.
“One of the things that our organization really stresses with our membership is we want to educate them on issues, but we also want them to be able to learn how to open up a conversation with other people,” said Pendergraft.  “They really like overall momentum of his rallies and his campaigns. They like that he isn’t willing to back down. He says what he believes and he stands on that.”
