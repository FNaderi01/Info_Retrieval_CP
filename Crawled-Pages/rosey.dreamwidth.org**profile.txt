                I want flatlands I want simplicity I need your arms wrapped hard around me I want open plains and scattered trees I want flower fields I want salty seas I want flatlands soft and steady breeze bringing scents of lined-up orchard trees dripping heavy with pears and dancing leaves I want flatlands will you go there with me -Chelsea Wolfe(c)coluna @ lj
