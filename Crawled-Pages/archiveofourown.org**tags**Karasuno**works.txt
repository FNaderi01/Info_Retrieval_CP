    Summary
      From the day you are born, you have a tattoo on your chest, right where your heart is. They vary from person to person, but everyone's soul mark lights up when they come into close proximity with their mate. At every point of time, there's always 5 Royals making up the Council of Five, the most powerful people in the world, on the same level as big corporation owners and political leaders around the world. A Royal can only be revealed after they are 15 years old, the age at which they are considered fully matured adults. (We'll talk more about that later.)                         A soul bond is unbreakable, and so mates rejecting one another is virtually unheard of. But then again, Kageyama has always been... an exception to the norm. He used to take pride in being different from others, and being called a "genius setter" was perhaps his favorite complement... until the day he lost it all because he was one.

    Summary
      (USHIJIMA X OC)They say that after making one thousand paper cranes you can make a wish and it will come true...---- Akiyama Umeko was a third year student at Shiratorizawa with one goal, to make one thousand paper cranes. This was her last year and she wanted to complete her goal. Umeko didn't really have much interest in anything other than the creative arts so it was only natural she didn't know much about volleyball. She had no reason to go to the gym, no reason to talk to the members of the club and certainly no reason to meet the captain of the team. However, a series of totally unplanned cliche events changed that.Soon she found herself very involved with the team and especially it's captain.

    Summary
      Shoyo has never had a nice time in school...or at home. His mother loves him, at least he hopes she does. His little sister doesn't understand and constantly misgenders  him.
Highschool was fine so far. He'd kept his secret and was able to play in boys volleyball. Terrified of being outed Hinata does his best to avoid making any mistakes. He binds through practice and games. The pain was nothing compared to the thought of being outed. Hinata does his best...but is it enough?

    Summary
      It doesn’t matter if you like volleyball or not, hell you haven’t even seen a game at all, but the fact that you heard that if you manage a really good team it could look really good on a resume for a college and as a deaf girl you need everything you could get. How will the Nekoma volleyball team cope with a new manager who's deaf?
