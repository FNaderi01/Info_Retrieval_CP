i LOVE watching tiktok thrift flips/sewing compilation videos because I 1.) love to sew and thrift flip and learn creative diy tips and 2.) I love watching teenagers make such truly ugly clothes because that’s exactly what i did at a teenager and it makes me so happy to see!! im watching a video of a teenager taking a perfectly fine t-shirt dress and turning it into a cami crop top and elastic-waist skirt situation complete with tie dye!! like yeah you go bb that outfit is absolutely tragic and i LOVE this for you!!! keep creating your own truth!! bleach the shit out of those jeans and paint an anime character on them with acrylic!! i hear you saying “isn’t this so cute?” at the end of your video in which you embroidered a floral nike logo onto a plain hoodie and i wholeheartedly disagree and im so fucking happy for you!!! this is what’s keeping me going in 2020!!!!

anonymous asked:I remember reading somewhere that, because of Japan's different relationship with LGBT things than we have in the west, subtext is pretty much taken as confirmation for LGBT pairings in things like anime. So if that's the case it makes sense the Japanese audience and the RWBY localization team took what is just subtext in the show and treated it as basically canon confirmation. i know exactly which post you’re talking about, although i can’t find it currently. it was a post about the way lightning farron is practically confirmed to be a lesbian when viewed through the lens of japanese culture and how lgbt rep is handled over there. the thing about japan is that, in some ways, it’s a very repressed society. (and this is not an insult, just when in comparison to more obnoxious cultures like america.) there’s a lot of these things where westerners misunderstand things about japan based on what they see in the media, which also works in the reverse in how eastern cultures misunderstand america based on what they see on tv, etc. in japan, there is this pressure to conform. where as individualism is rewarded and encouraged in the west, in japan and in other asian countries such as korea or china, this “individualism” is not something that is encouraged or even desired in most aspects. in japan, it’s less about being unique and more about fitting into the crowd? in a way. not in a bad way, but more along the lines of japan being less about the individual and more about the group as a whole. if you need proof, just look at any anime or video game that has a character who stands out from the crowd. a good example is persona 5′s ryuji. he doesn’t wear the typical school uniform, he doesn’t blend in with a crowd–he dyes his hair, he wears his clothes sloppily, he wears a loud t-shirt rather than the usual uniform. he’s presented as a troublemaker, and this is shown largely through his appearance. this is intentional, and this doesn’t stop with him. look at other characters like ichigo from bleach, etc. characters who standout are often seen as problematic in some way, and this is tied into japanese society and how “individualism” is treated there.you could look at it as the western ideal being “myself; unique”. who YOU are is important, making something of yourself, etc. in japan especially, it’s more, “us; belonging (to a group)”. who you are is important as far as what you can bring to your family, friends, society, etc. it’s less about the individual and more about what they can provide to the “group”. so when you consider that in reference to lgbt representation, just the act of being openly lgbt is going against the grain in japan, it’s standing out, it’s making a spectacle of yourself. this goes against japanese culture. over there, it’s much more typical for lgbt people to put their own desires aside for the sake of conforming, remaining closeted so as not to bring discrimination upon themselves, engaging in false marriages/having “beards” etc. you could think of japanese lgbt community being about 20 years behind us as far as openness, if it makes it easier. so when it comes to lgbt rep in japanese media, it’s kind of a “seen, but not heard” thing. what western media would treat as subtext or hints, in japan, those same things would be taken in cultural context to be as good as canon. that’s likely why bumbleby is being treated the way it is by the japanese RWBY team–because, coming from a japanese viewer’s point of view, bumbleby isn’t just subtext or “queerbait”. from their point of view, bumbleby is obvious canon.
