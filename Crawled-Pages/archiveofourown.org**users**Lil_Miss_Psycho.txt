    Summary
      Danny, Drew and Kurtis meet up with Cody and Noel to film a video in an old, abandoned- possibly haunted house. The backdrop makes for a great set piece, but it does a poor job of hiding it's owners secrets. Drew is acting weird, the owner wants to negotiate a trespassing suit with Danny, and Cody is hitting on Kurtis? Let's jump right into it guys!

    Summary
      Dream is invited on a trip with his ex-girlfriend. Fake boyfriend shenanigans ensue. Basically an amalgamation of all of my favourite fanfic tropes, that I haven't seen that much of in this fandom. I'm terrible at summaries, please just give it a go.

    Summary
      It used to be wrong to pretend that everything was okay. Now it’s assumed. Maybe that’s why Damian and Tim are sitting on the roof of a building in Blüdhaven and deciding that their story is that they came for ice cream (and nothing else).
