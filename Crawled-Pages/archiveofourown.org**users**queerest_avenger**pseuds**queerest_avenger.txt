      I’m really surprised that I was able to write this at all, but I’m glad I got to do something for my favourite android boy’s “birthday”, even if it’s really late. It’s definitely been awhile since I’ve written smut, so bare with me. Slight Gentle Fem Domme!Reader/Switch!Connor if you squint really hard.

    No Archive Warnings ApplyRK700 misc androidsRK700 - Freeform Prequel to DBH though it will cross into actual game events as well as they play out from an outside pov Androids struggling to survive in NYC while finding love and support in their growing community also there's an android speakeasy this is just how i am guys rated mature for eventual android smut plus violence and some swearing canon characters show up eventually
    Summary
      Before Connor, first of the RK800 line, began his fateful investigation of deviant androids, there was Jacob, the RK700 that preceded him. He failed in his assignment, but he did not go quiet into the night when he was decommissioned. Rather, he became the thing he had once hunted and disappeared into the depths of New York City in search of a new life. After finding refuge in the abandoned remains of a 1920s era speakeasy and rescuing a few fellow deviants, RK700 finds himself in charge of the only safe-haven for deviants this side of Detroit, whether he likes it or not.

    Summary
      Sequel to Chicago's Bittersweet Ending. Six months later, Connor thought he would never see her again. Now she was before him and he was filled with urges he had never encountered before. He greatly wished to feel her touch and affection, and he also wanted to be of service to her. He quietly despaired at these desires as he had no idea how to proceed.Meanwhile, a bizarre murder spree shakes the city of Detroit. With android rights still on shaky ground, the last thing they need are human deaths believed to be related to a zealous android cult.

    Summary
      Vagary(n.) an unexpected and inexplicable change in a situation or in someone's behaviour.Deviancy fascinated you. It was something new, and for now, unique to American androids. Anyone showing remote interest in the psychology of androids were unheard of, outside of yourself, and being so engrossed in a world that no one else would dare step foot into gave you opportunities no one else could get. And being able to do the exact research you've always wanted to your entire life? Well, you weren't doing too badly.
