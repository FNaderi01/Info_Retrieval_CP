    Summary
      Puck sided with a human against Oberon. He fought to keep the child away from Oberon. And between that and his refusal to attend the Gathering when summoned, Puck’s actions demonstrated a complete betrayal of their lord and ruler. He proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that Oberon no longer commanded him, his obedience, his devotion, or his fealty. His loyalty now belonged firmly to a human by the name of David Xanatos.The child should have been brought back to Avalon and Puck’s life should have been forfeit. That was Oberon’s right as ruler.But a deal was struck instead. Alexander would be raised by his parents and tutored in magic while in the outside world. And while Puck would teach and protect the child, he would be thoroughly punished for his betrayal. He'd chosen the humans and the existence that he’d forged there while adopting a human identity over obedience and his home in Avalon? Then outside his lessons and protecting the child, Puck would be completely stripped of his magic and bound in that mortal shape.With a mortal shape came mortal vulnerabilities. And a loophole that another trickster could use.

    Summary
      Once upon a time, long before humans set foot outside of Eden and long before his inelegant landing in a pool of boiling sulfur, Crowley had been an angel. An angel with a very different name and far less cynicism. And that angel was made to build Her creations. He built stars, nebulas, and other beautiful and complicated things far out there in the cosmos. He shaped fundamental elements and materials into new creations. He molded burning fires and sculpted dust into breath-taking patterns. He started bright and powerful reactions, serving as a catalyst to spark the birth of stars. He set various celestial objects spinning.He built. He took raw materials and built wonderous things with them. He built because that was the role that She made him for. In the end, was rebuilding that much different than building? And wasn't rebuilding fairly close to healing?When it was his angel's existence on the line, Crowley was willing to grab at any chance available. He would find a way to fix what had been damaged. He would find a way to save him.

    Summary
      (Set in "Kingdom Hearts 3" after rescuing Aqua. Canon divergent)Lea remembered being an only child and spending all his time with Isa instead of parents that barely seemed to remember his presence. The closest thing to a sibling that he ever had was the slightly older boy that he used to consider his friend.And yet he keeps latching onto children with Keyblades and trying to watch out for them. If he didn't stop, he was going to get himself killed (again) from acting like an older brother to these kids.

    Summary
      Sometimes concepts are too big, too complicated, and too ineffable to properly describe or understand. Sometimes it is easier to imagine things as metaphors. And metaphorically speaking, reality could be viewed as an obscure and complex version of poker played in a pitch-black room, with blank cards, for infinite stakes, with a Dealer who won’t tell you the rules and who smiles all the time.Of course, reality can also be viewed as two powerful angels going down to Earth with the goal of wiping the "traitor" out of existence the old-fashioned way. If more precise methods don't work, then simply smite away at the target until there's nothing left.(Inspired by a lovely piece of artwork by WhiteleyFoster.)

  Summary
    Adam Young was meant to be the Anti-Christ. His entire purpose was to cause the end of the world. In many ways, he was the Chosen One, albeit for a rather dark path. But he was raised completely human and normal, without any unusual expectations of him beyond being a regular boy. He remained unaware of his heritage or destiny until the very end. And though he was chosen, he did not accept his role and rejected it and his connection to Lucifer.Warlock Dowling was not chosen. He was born as an ordinary child, with no special skills or powers. He should have lived an average life. But he was raised with certain Expectations. Occult and ethereal entities Expected him to be the Anti-Christ. He was not chosen or fated for such a role, but reality tends to bend a little when angels and demons have Expectations.In the end, it is just a series of choices.

  Summary
    Once upon a time, he ended up responsible for a pair of teenage Keyblade wielders who were technically toddlers when it came to actual life experience. If he was going to blame anyone for that, he should probably blame Saïx since he assigned him the task of keeping an eye on Roxas during his early zombie-like days. But then Roxas and Xion ended up his best friends and he would have done anything to protect them. And then he did try everything to get them back.But even after the half-pints had existed again, it wasn't really over. They needed someone to look after them and help them out. It wasn't like they knew how to exist outside of Organization XIII. They had never been real people with real lives. And yes, they were absolutely lethal on a battlefield and could definitely beat Lea to a pulp in a fight if they were ever forced to go at full strength. But they still needed someone to take care of them.And Lea honestly seemed to have a habit of taking in strays in general and Keyblade wielders specifically. He would have sacrifice anything to have his friends back. And now that he's regained them, he'll just need figure out what comes next. It can't be that hard to give them an actual life and a home.

  Summary
    Maybe destiny (or the Time Masters) had plans for them, but that doesn't mean that the Legends will follow those plans. They are a team of geniuses, heroes, and criminals. They aren't the types of people to behave like puppets on strings, obeying without question. They tend to be disruptive, chaotic, and stubborn. Even breaking time itself cannot stop them from trying to save the world.When the universe tries to take something away, they'll always steal it back. And probably ruin a lot of people's plans along the way. But that's not necessarily a bad thing.Canon divergent after the ending of season 2 of "Legends of Tomorrow" and season 3 of "The Flash."

  Summary
    Annabelle Lennox is just another little girl, just starting school. She's clever and learns rather quickly. She hates bullies and will not tolerate them trying to be mean. She likes to draw and color in her free time. Her favorite subject of her drawings would be the black truck that is usually parked outside her house.She never tells anyone, however, that the truck isn't ''just'' a truck. It is her best friend, Ironhide.She eventually meets more of the Autobots and likes them just as much as the weapon specialist. But of course, the Decepticons can't remain in the background of her life forever...

    Summary
      It wasn't difficult for Crowley to slither into the position of "Snake God"... it was Ancient Egypt after all. No, the hard part was figuring out how to handle a relationship with an angel who happened to be living amongst the slaves.Posting my Prince of Omens comic here so I can share the more nsfw chapters without fear of them getting flagged.
