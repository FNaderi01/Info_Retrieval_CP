    Summary
      Left with an unloving family after the death of her parents, Iris Lily Potter does what she must to get by. Being practically a slave to her relations, she is relieved to receive an invitation to attend Hogwarts. Her discovery of her witchcraft, however, became bittersweet when she understood the horrible circumstances that preceeded her. Still, she knew it was a way out of that house, at the very least. She soon found that ignorance is bliss, and knowledge gave her power she never wanted. Unfortunately for her, she knew she must utilize her extraordinary magic for the greater good. That doesn't mean she has to be happy about it, though.

"Why don't you tell me what year it is?"He smirked almost unwillingly. "Alright. The year is 1941."-----Noah Eden Potter is the twin sister of Leif James Potter. She knew her life wasn't normal. Knew that being locked in the attic of an Ancestral Home for days on end with no food, and having it become her bedroom wasn't normal. Even dangerous. She couldn't do much to stop it though.The first time that Eden realizes that she herself isn't normal, is when she sleeps. When she's finally away from home, and where she is safe and loved.When she sleeps, she finally knows peace.

    Summary
      Tilly and Phoebe Potter return to Hogwarts for their second year to find that things have changed. They both have their own battles to fight as they struggle to adapt and grow with the world around them. New challenges await; along with new foes and new friends. The girls learn the hard way that some scars never heal; and sometimes the most difficult answers are to the questions we ask of ourselves.
