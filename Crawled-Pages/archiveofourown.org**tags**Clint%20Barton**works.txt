    Summary
      Sequel to "Time and Again." Now in the 21st century, Peggy Carter is tasked with directing the Avengers Initiative - if she can manage to get it pulled together, that is. It is proving more difficult than it would seem, even for the woman who founded SHIELD, especially when dealing with a temperamental genius, a recalcitrant general, and an alien invasion in New Mexico...and then there is Tony Stark. Peggy finds herself running out of patience and time as she tries to keep the Avengers from failing before they can even start.

      New Yorkers are used to the weird. The stuff of pulp novel and B-movie schlock happens every Tuesday here: monster attacks, aliens and a robot invasion or two. With every terror and wonder, their heroes assemble to defend them from behind masks and capes. So what has everyone so rattled when an unidentified flying object looks to be incoming. Why are the Avengers releasing nervous public statements about a rocket in the Hudson?A new breed of superhero is dawning, and in the wake of global tragedy these may be the folks to take on the challenges of today.The Avengers, Defenders and Unity Squads are teams pulled together by crisis. Is the world of heroes ready, for a family?

    Summary
      Bucky Barnes leads quite the charmed life. He has a thriving tattoo shop, a son he adores, the world‚Äôs best dogs, and a great group of friends ‚Äî almost all of whom are in relationships. And maybe he'd been the one nudging them towards each other, but there's nothing wrong with a little match-making. The world could use more romance.As for him personally, well, he doesn‚Äôt need anyone for the long haul. Not when every girl he meets is someone who he thinks would be perfect for someone else.But then Steve Rogers comes into his shop looking for some ink, and maybe that‚Äôs the problem right there. Maybe what he's looking for in a relationship isn't a girl at all.

    Summary
      Steve‚Äôs heard people say that Captain America appeared in the future twice the man he had been before. That could be debated, of course, but it‚Äôs true that he‚Äôs still more or less whole. But Bucky...he arrived here fractured. It‚Äôs as if only a few fragments of him made the journey through those decades intact and the rest was shaken loose and left behind somewhere, scattered across time like shreds of cloth in a storm.
