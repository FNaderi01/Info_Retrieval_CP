    Summary
      The Trial was just the beginning...16-year-olds Dink Duncan, Josh Pinto, and Ruth Rose Hathaway expected many things to happen to them once they turned 16. Getting kidnapped by a group of masked men outside their homes was one of them. 16-year-olds Dave Smith, Bill Robinson, and Rosa Crusoe did not expect to wake up in a school-like environment with EVERYONE staring at them. To make matters worse, the President and three other members of the Literature Club Rosa is (apparently) involved in keeps acting weird around her brother MC, Bill witnesses a classmate being stalked, Dave finds out that the school has a dark secret, and all three of them keep seeing ghosts.What is a newly formed soulmate triad to do? And why do the three ghosts want to help them figure out their soulmate bond?

    Summary
      Rich was dead.Wow. That was, uh, hard for Jeremy to say. That kid who partially ruined his life and then was his frenemy for a month-and-a-half under dubious circumstances was dead. Jeremy, along with the rest of the junior class, was given a very harsh reminder of his own mortality. Rich was only sixteen and now he was gone.Except, maybe he wasn't.

    Summary
      Gasping Kokichi shot open his eyes and jerked forward in the bed. What. The. Fuck? Where was he? How was he anywhere? Kokichi noticed an IV hanging from his absolutely-not-crushed hand making him blink at it. There weren’t even any scars to show where he’d been flattened like a pancake. Was he dead? As he moved his eyes around the room settling on the other beds set up in a circle around some large computer-looking machine. His body felt heavy and he could see Shuichi sleeping in a similar bed a few spots away from him with what looked like a VR machine on his head.Shuichi and Kokichi had signed up for a virtual reality killing game show... and were dating before the game. Shuichi feels differently when he's not forced to fear for his life constantly. Audition tapes they made from before the game hold troubling news. And Danganronpa is a beast with many heads that need to be cut down: both from the inside by his beloved detective and on the outside by Kokichi and his reinvented DICE members. Can the two come together to slay the horrible company that is Danganronpa? An 'evil' supreme leader and a detective: the unlikely couple that might just save the world.(updated summary because I feel like this is better)

      After a round of Manhunt gone wrong, Dream and George are stuck on a survival world server for a whole week. Though it seems like a normal server at first, everything is not what it seems, and soon George and Dream get wrapped up in an adventure that neither of them were prepared for. 
With a countdown on their time, and limited lives to spare, the two friends only have one option - keep going and survive.

  There was once a man called Jack, and he had been betrayed or abandoned by everyone he ever cared about, and he decided that if he ever cared about anyone ever again, he was going to betray or abandon them first.
 Then Jack made a friend. His name was Rhys. Chapter 5 of Tales happened. Rhys kept the eye. Welcome to the fix-it. It's gonna take a while. (It'll be worth it.)
