  		        nonbinarywithaknife:smallestbrown:here it is! little FH animatic (or whatever it‚Äôs called when you storyboard to a song), featuring¬†‚Äúmonster‚Äù by dodie.(also spoilers for only ep 1 &amp; 2 of fantasy high!)Video description: An animatic of the Bad Kids before and then their first and second day at school. It‚Äôs uncolored, and drawn with blue line art on a white background. ‚ÄúMonster‚Äù by Dodie plays in the background.The title screen says ‚Äúmonster‚Äù: a fantasy high animatic" by @/smallestbrown. It has a bunch of little head shot drawings of the Bad Kids.It starts with a view of the Thistlespring Tree. It shows Gorgug‚Äôs room from the outside, and then we see him. He‚Äôs sitting with his knees drawn up, listening to music. He then presses his hands tighter on the headphones and looks distressed. We then see the Abernant family at the dining table. Adaine is on the far right, looking at Aelwen on the far left. Angwyn is sitting facing the camera (he‚Äôs reading a newspaper) and Arianwen is across from him. Then we zoom closer to see Adaine looking down at her place mat- instead of a plate, she has a large orb sitting there. She looks disappointed. Then the camera gets closer to her face and her expression shifts more angry. Then we see Aelwen smile, and it shifts into a mean smirk.Then it changes to Fig, drawn in profile. She‚Äôs standing and almost resting her head against a mirror. She‚Äôs frowning. The view gets closer to her face, and she straightens her head, still looking at the mirror. She looks vaguely disgusted and a little upset. She looks over to the side and the camera changes so we can see Sandra Lynn standing in the open doorway to Fig‚Äôs room. Fig‚Äôs expression, visible in the mirror, looks angry, now.Then we switch to a view of Riz‚Äôs conspiracy board. It‚Äôs covered in notes, photos, and other papers relating to Penny‚Äôs disappearance. The camera moves along it until we see Riz, looking at it thoughtfully with a hand on his chin. Then the view changes to Riz closing a briefcase, that has a business card with his name on it in it. Then we see the camera get closer to a photo on a small table. The photo is of a younger Pok and Sklonda holding a very young Riz on their shoulders. Then, we see Gorgug on the first day of school. He‚Äôs holding a little flower and looking despondent, but then he sees something off screen and he smiles. Then it shows Fabian, looking determined, from across the way. He marches angrily up to Gorgug, who is holding out the flower. The screen goes black for a second.Next we see Adaine, sitting on the ground, against a bookshelf. She‚Äôs holding a book to her chest and looking nauseous. Goldenhoard‚Äôs tail is just visible at the side.Then we see Kristen, talking and gesturing to Ragh. Next, a surprised Riz, in the middle of rummaging through the principal‚Äôs office. Goldenhoard‚Äôs crossed arms are visible off to the side.Next, Fig rummaging through the teacher‚Äôs lounge fridge. Goldenhoard‚Äôs snout is seen in profile, as he catches her.Then we see Coach Daybreak, pointing angrily inside, and each Bad Kid flashes onto the screen as they walk inside. First Adaine, then a sad looking Riz. Next Fig, who is smiling, and then Gorgug, who is looking at the ground. Then Fabian, then Kristen, who waves at Coach Daybreak.The next scene is the Bad Kids at the lunch line. Fig is in front, and waves at Doreen. Behind her is Gorgug, and then Kristen. Kristen has her bible on her tray.Then we see Riz, Fabian, and Adaine in line, with none of them smiling. Next we see a closeup of Zayn bumping into Kristen, and knocking her bible into a vat of cream corn. The video ends.(via aelwynrights)
