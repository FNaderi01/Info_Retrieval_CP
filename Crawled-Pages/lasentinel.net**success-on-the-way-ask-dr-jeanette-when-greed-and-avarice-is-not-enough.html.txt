Success On “The Way” Ask Dr. Jeanette  ‘When Greed and Avarice Is Not Enough’            
	                	                Published March 21, 2019

Life presents challenges. Sometimes it may be difficult to “think outside the box.” However, we move forward and survey where we have been, how we evaluate life’s path…it takes meditation, thinking through what’s happened. Look at the highlights, the successes and things which may not have worked well as you would have preferred. Patience. Life isn’t a straight line. It’s more like a graft, ups and downs. In this retrospective, one may be tempted to compare one’s own life’s tracks with those of others. Be reminded, you have your personal gifts and talents which you should singularly compare with yourself, not others. Who are we admiring? It’s repeatedly proven that some, if not many of you may be admiring at a distance let you down morally, ethically and otherwise.
Be introspective as you look into your own life’s lens. We never knew how some of these famous people’s real life rolled along in the background. We see what’s exposed [whether true or not] or which could be very much unlike reality of that person’s lifestyle. If you’re depending on mimicking someone’s life, only a façade of reality, you are bound to be disappointed and discouraged! Case in point: “Felicity Huffman, Lori Loughlin are among about 44 (NBC) Charged in College Admissions Scam Court documents unsealed Tuesday revealed a pricey scam to get students admitted to elite universities, e.g. Georgetown, Stanford, UCLA, University of San Diego, USC, University of Texas, Wake Forest, and Yale — as recruited athletes, regardless of athletic ability.
The suspects paid bribes…a few thousand dollars up to $6 million, without the admitted students knowing. [payments purportedly for charitable contributions to scam for college entrance exams, some claiming they were athletes and who were not] Is all this worth it to be pursued by Federal prosecutors?? No! No! The scam was allegedly run by a man in California who ran a college-counseling agency nicknamed “the Key.” The service would accept payments from parents and direct their money to an SAT or ACT administrator, or a college athletic coach. Coaches would fabricate the student’s athletic history, exam administrators would correct the student’s exam, or a proctor take the college admissions test instead. During a press conference about the college-admissions scheme — code-named “Operation Varsity Blues” by the FBI — investigators said they have not charged any students, but, there is evidence that some students knew their parents were bribing, while other students had no idea.” [From Vulture by Hunter Harris]Believable?

Yes! Unchecked greed and avarice kills and has no bounds. You’re going to get where you’re going fast enough without pressing into unethical pathways to get you into big trouble! When you see famous people committing suicide, hanging themselves, chronic lying, dying from overdose, imprisonment, raping, molesting, killing others; don’t admire them. Pray for them. You’re worth more! And your life! Writings (c) Teach Our Children.
