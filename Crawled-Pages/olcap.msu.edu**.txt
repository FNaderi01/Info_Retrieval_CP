The SolCAP project is supported by the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Applied Plant Genomics CAP Program of USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture.
The Solanaceae Coordinated Agricultural Project (SolCAP) was supported by the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Applied Plant Genomics CAP Program of USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture. The project was awarded $5.4 million dollars between 10/1/2008 through 8/31/2012.   The project succeeded in linking together people from public institutions, private institutions and industries dedicated to the improvement of the Solanaceae crops: potato and tomato. Through innovative research, education and training the SolCAP project focused on translating genomic advances to US tomato and potato breeding programs. The impact of this research is leading to significantly improved varieties that benefit the processors, the consumer and the environment. 
The SolCAP project is a recipient of the 2011 U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary of Agricultureâ€™s Honor Award. The Honor Awards are the most prestigious awards presented by the Secretary of Agriculture and recognize exceptional leadership, contributions, or public service.
