    Summary
      Harry returns to Hogwarts for his 8th year, and it is quite adventurous; He gets in a relationship with his worst enemy, only to find out he is in cahoots with a previously known death eater. Harry tracks him down, leading to a domino effect of complicated situations.Many things happen in this story. Harry goes back to the Dursley's to get closure, Draco goes to the Burrow, The Weasley's go to the Manor, Harry shows Draco the mirror of Erised, Draco wearing Harry's Weasley sweater (a lot!), Harry tracks down the resurrection stone, Harry and Draco become godparents to someone other than Teddy, Andromeda and Narcissa make up, and there are a few near death experiences. This is full of Harry and Draco's romance, but there is so, so much more. Tons of fluff, some smut, Deamus, Nuna/Luneville, Romione.
