    Summary
      Going to a concert with the kids should be a fun, relaxing, stress-free evening. Somehow, the murder isn't the main reason that doesn't work out.Or: what Turnabout Serenade would have been like if Jove had been around.

    Summary
      Phoenix saves Miles from a fire at the courthouse, but gets pinned under rubble while doing so. After he's rescued, it's discovered that Phoenix has amnesia, and can't remember anything about himself for his makeshift family. What's more, Franziska has been arrested for the arson, and the prosecutor for the case is dead-set on getting her thrown in jail. It's up to the WAA, and Miles to restore Phoenix's memory and figure out the truth of the arson.
