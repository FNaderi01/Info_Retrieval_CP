LAPD South Traffic Division/South Traffic Advisory Council &amp; Mothers In Action Host ‘Comedy For Car Seats’            
				By Sentinel News Service                
	                	                Published April 14, 2017
This year, The Los Angeles Police Department, South Traffic Division along with South Traffic Advisory Council and our community partner, Mothers In Action, will be hosting a “COMEDY FOR CAR SEATS” EVENT ON April 23.  The event will be held at the Game Sports Lounge located at 5630 W. Manchester Avenue, LA, CA 90045 from 5:00pm – 9:00pm.
The funds will be used to benefit the department’s “Child Safety Car Seat Program” as well as provide car seats for those families that are unable to purchase them due to financial difficulties.
        ADVERTISEMENT        
Every year hundreds of young lives are lost in traffic accidents leaving behind heartbroken parents, family members and friends.  The lifesaving effects of child car seats and booster seats are indisputable.  However, they work best when used properly.  Often,  parents and caregivers are completely unaware of the importance of not having a child in a car seat, not having that seat properly installed as well as prematurely moving a child from child restraint to using a seatbelt only.
As of January 1, 2017, the law states that a child must be in a car seat rear facing until the age of 2 years old.  Children under the age of 8 years old and 4’9” must be in a Car Seat or Booster seat.
During Child Safety Seat Check Up, parents and caregivers drive up with their children in (in their car seats) while trained technicians inspect the installation of those car seats.  The check Up includes the inspection of the proper fit of the child in the seat, the proper installation of the seat in the vehicle, and checking the seat to assure that it is safe as well as if that particular seat has been recalled for safety reasons.  There will be a limited number of car seats on hand to replace those seats determined to be damaged, unsafe, or inappropriate for the child.
Residents are advised to make an appointment.  If you do not have an appointment, there may be a minimum of one hour or, you could be turned away.  To make an appointment please call Officer Adams at (323) 421-2590.
Please call (323) 421-2588 to purchase tickets for the Comedy 4 Cars Seats show.  Help save a child’s life for only $20.00 per ticket.
