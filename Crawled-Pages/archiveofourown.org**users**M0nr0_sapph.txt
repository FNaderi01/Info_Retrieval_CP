    Summary
  Life as a civilian is boring. Even between apartment hunting with Fuyumi and his ex-convict nuisances showing up at the parlor “for old time’s sake”, it’s far too mundane. How do people cope with minor annoyances without resorting to extreme violence?He supposes that most of them don’t share a shift with Shigaraki Tomura. That’s an unfair advantage. His ex-boss turned co-owner—a decision Dabi regrets every day—has been whining about customers all morning.“If I have to tattoo another ‘United States of Smash’ on someone’s ass I’m gonna become a villain again,” he grumbles under his breath, not even waiting for Kurogiri to finish ringing up his client first. Dabi shoots him a glare. One of these days he’s gonna send them out of business with his lack of tact.Not that Dabi is much better. Good thing this isn’t about him.
or: several years after the League pays their debt with justice, they gather together in Dabi and Shigaraki’s co-owned tattoo parlor to discuss the future—and maybe to note how it’s not all that different from their past.

    Summary
      "It’s not that his peers are inherently cruel to the Quirkless. Izuku firmly believes that, if the truth ever got out to his classmates, they would still welcome him with open arms. At the same time though, acceptance does not necessarily mean they are well-informed on the subject. His classmates might be well-intentioned, but sometimes the words that come out of their mouths cut deeper than even he could have ever expected."ORIn which Izuku possesses the words and knowledge to try and correct his classmate's misguided beliefs concerning Quirkless people, but actually communicating them is another challenge altogether.

    Summary
      “Belos gave me a choice. He told me to get rid of Luz, one way or another. And I did. Now everyone’s back in the realm they belong in, nobody got hurt and Luz is forever out of danger. It’s best for everyone involved that way.”“Keep telling yourself that, Lily.” Eda glared daggers at her sister. “Oh, and solid job on locking your own protégée out of the Boiling Isles, by the way.”“What are you talking about?”“Amity went through the door after Luz,” Emira chimed in. Her voice was scarily monotone. “Now she’s trapped on the other side of the portal you just destroyed.”—Summer has come to an end, which means Luz is forced to return from ‘summer camp’ and resume her regular life back at home with her mom. When she leaves, she promises she’ll be back soon.Unable to overcome her fear of telling Luz how she feels about her before she steps through the door, Amity finally finds the courage to do it when the door closes behind Luz and makes the rash decision to follow her.Then something goes wrong, and now Amity is stuck in Luz’s realm with her crush, far away from everything she’s ever known.Getting back home might prove more difficult than she’d originally hoped...
