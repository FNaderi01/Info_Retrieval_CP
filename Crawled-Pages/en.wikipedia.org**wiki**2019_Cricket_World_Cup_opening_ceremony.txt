		The Opening Ceremony of the Cricket World Cup 2019 took place on 29 May 2019, at The Mall in central London.[1] The ICC promised that the opening ceremony would be the ‘most celebrated start to a Cricket World Cup ever’. The ceremony included live sport, music and entertainment for a planned 4,000 fans. Cricket journalist Andy Bull estimated that "there cannot have been many more than 400" fans actually present, which he ascribed in part to heavy rain.[2] It ended with the official World Cup song, "Stand By", performed by Loryn and Rudimental.[3]
