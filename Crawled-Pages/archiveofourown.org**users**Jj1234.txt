    Summary
      Mochi doesn't wanna be Hokage, she doesn't really even need to be famous. She just wants to be strong enough to keep all her precious people safe and happy for the rest of time. She'd also like it if the adults could understand that even though she is sometimes female and sometimes male, she does not understand most of the kunoichi classes. At all.Other than that, if her Rama Tou-san could please let her make sure her kiddies and friends didn't get themselves killed in peace, and everyone would stop wondering where the Uzumaki kid and the Kyuubi went off to, she'd be golden!(series is to put works together, this is not a sequel)

    Summary
      Fearing his power, the Observants banish Danny to another world. Reborn as a "sickly" civilian girl in a village full of weirdo killers, prejudice adults, and a whole herd of outcast children, Danny- now Shimome- tries to find a new reason to live. Unbeknownst to him, his very arrival is causing changes in the entire world order.***Naruto has always felt different, and his tousan says that's okay. But even his Rama couldn't keep all the mean people away. No one ever seemed to like him, except the Very Nice Boy from the clothes shop. He was the coolest, ya'know!

  Summary
    The stories are connected in my mind mostly. One is an AU Naruto-Danny Phantom crossover, the other is the AU of my AU that started to bug me and make me curious. They are related because they come from a lot of the same concepts, or the Naruto parts do, and are supposed to be "for want of a nail" type canon-divergence, just one is crossover and one is not.Update: it will be a while until anything is posted for the second one. Like, a long while.

    Summary
      Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE.

    Summary
  The lesson here, Susie thinks, is that tricking Death is tricky business. How do you outwit the personification of oblivion? Chess, obviously, won’t be the answer.
  Or: Susie plays Calvinball with Death.

    Summary
      The Hidden Leaf Village in Naruto's time seems to have forgotten just why the village was founded and have lost their way. Through a mishap with a hiraishin seal, Tobirama finds himself during Naruto's time and he is having none of this nonsense. His brother may be gone, but he won't stand to have Hashirama's dream trampled so.And if he has to cause a civil war or burn the village down to the ground? Well that depends on how much resistance he meets.All Tobirama does know for certain is that no child will suffer underneath the protection of Konoha and if he has to take them in and care for them himself, then he will.
