                        teesatztexte:i am so determined to fall more in love with life. intentionally romanticising the walks i am on, the birds chirping, the blooming nature around me, the water in my cup of tea turning from a light peach tone to a dark pink, the poetry i write, the things i am learning, my handwriting, dozing off while sitting in ront of my window, all of it and more. I have to take a closer look at the little things that make my heart beat faster.
