    Summary
      Things have... escalated, to say the least.no guardian, few friends and a whole lot of pressure.
since that's the case how about a bit of reprieve from the hot mess that is the city of Paris and go to Gotham! a perfectly sound plan...
sure there are villains... but hey! at least now you can be mad about it or scared.
((like when she gets left behind on multiple occasions!))
villains and criminals aren't the only things that Marinette finds in the city of crime, although... is stealing her heart counted as a crime? 
it matters not! she can deal with a crush!
she is trending?... sure she can deal with fame... or at least she will be needing to soon anyway.
she gets a new family?... sure sure, she can deal with more mouths to feed
wait... why are they all so protective?! she has been a good person, she doesn't deserve this!! QAQ.
(Marinette could NOT, in fact, deal with a crush. it all went downhill from there)

    Summary
      One trip somehow both ruins and saves Marinette’s life and mind. It’s a symphony of opposites twining around each other at the same time, simultaneously ruling her fate. People who both fail and succeed as saviors. A girl both destroyed and preserved. People both dead yet forever alive. Isn’t a person’s mind intriguing? So beautiful yet treacherous. Or: a series of oneshot-style chapters that tell the story of Marinette’s life as it gets torn asunder and the Kents adopt her in an attempt to connect the frayed ends once more.

    Summary
      Soulmate AUIn a world where soulmates are real but the form that a soulbond can take is as numerous as the stars in the sky, Marinette has no physical mark on her body that might be a soul bond. No such mark has ever appeared. And after witnessing the only other person in her class without a visible soul mark— her long time crush Adrien Agreste— form a romantic soul bond right in front of her eyes... Well. She would be a lot worse off if she hadn’t unexpectedly formed her own just a few short months later. Too bad the Universe seems to be treating this whole thing, both their secret identities and their bond, as nothing but one big game.**edit: this story now has a tumblr at soulmate-game.tumblr.com**

    Summary
      A potential ally appears in Gotham just in time to help the Batfamily face down a formidable enemy. What Robin finds confusing is that she's wearing a different costume each time he runs into her. Where is she getting all of them? Why are they all animal themed? And most importantly, when did he start looking forward to seeing her on patrol?
