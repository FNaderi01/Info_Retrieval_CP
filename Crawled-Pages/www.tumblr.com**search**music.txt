(Tw: mild flash)Enjoy this video of me and my guitar teacher improvising off of a chord progression because I said “it sounded like a cool fantasy song where they’re singing about something tragic that happened in the village 500 years ago”Also there are some weird cuts in here! The original video is about 6 minutes long, so it wouldn’t let me post 😭

I swear to god nothings ever given me so much seratonin than Corpse’s existence, like at first it was his voice and how hot it was, but then I started watching more of his videos and you know stalked him a little and he is literally so wholesome. Especially his laugh, you’d think with that voice it’d be a really menacing laugh but it’s sooooo cuteee, I literally smile so hard when I hear him laugh and sffzscwgsf he’s so cute and when he’s doing the admin swipe card thing (among us) and he keeps failing dhshavaccaxa that’s literally so adorable. He also makes music like wowiwiiwiwowow and he’s into horror shit, like this man can’t get better. Oh and when his anxiety starts acting up and he’s all worried all the time , I just wanna like tell him it’s fine and don’t worry. He’s also literally so smart, like his iq level is probably like 666282871172616 idk dude this man can manipulate peoples minds and then he just wins and everyone is still so surprised.There’s so much more about him that I love and if you like corpse I have so much respect for you deadass, like your making good decisions in life.

So I’ve been rocking the hell out to Van Halen ever since Eddie’s passing (RIP) but I kind of want us not to forget that he’s the six string face melter behind “Beat It”, also. Michael Jackson loved him. Considering that “Thriller” is the greatest Pop album ever sold, even to this very day…well…
