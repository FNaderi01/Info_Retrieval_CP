            Chapter 8: On Borrowed Time        Jamie/Claire Modern AU: The story of Claire Beauchamp, a feminist studies scholar and J.A.M.M Fraser, a playwright, spanning over a period of ten years between Cambridge, MA and Edinburgh, Scotland.Thank you for staying with this story. Deepest gratitude to @lcbeauchampoftarth for her amazing energy and mad beta skills, and to @notevenjokingfic for giving this chapter some love. Previous chapterChapter 8Edinburgh7 years ago—Scars.Injury and trauma of spectacular violence.Fibrous tissues intricately weaving themselves in the healing process.Physical. Psychological. Emotional.Jirah.Visible, they sometimes are visually repulsive.Betraying the self, uncloaking hidden secrets.Marking the vulnerability of life’s journey.Cicatrices.Invisible, hidden in infinity’s realm.Mourning unheard whimpers, shielding mental anesthesia.Feeding the relentless void deep within. The observable scar, it heals with time. Not that time erases the memory of violence. But the tangible roots itself in concrete spaces of recovery, allowing the sensory to mitigate the burden. What of the indiscernible scar, the one that hungers in despair, thrives in loneliness, and bleeds in silence, forever beyond the reach of physical salvation?   Keep reading

On Borrowed TimeJamie/Claire Modern AU: The story of Claire Beauchamp, a feminist studies scholar and J.A.M.M Fraser, a playwright, spanning over a period of ten years between Cambridge, MA and Edinburgh, Scotland.This is my first fic. My deepest gratitude goes to @notevenjokingrightnow for giving me the courage to see this through. She tolerated my incessant questions, paranoia, and self-doubt. For @kalendraashtar, you uplift my spirits with your words of wisdom. To everyone who have DM me with messages of encouragement, thank you for your care. It means a lot to a first-time writer.PrologueCambridge, MassachusettsPresent DayLeaves fluttering in the breeze. Branches, bare. An exercise in self-protection. The banks of the Charles River. Resplendent in shades of red, amber, and brown. Cambridge in autumn. Warm spices, crisp air, damp earth. The scent, a balm for the wounded soul. The memories, a splinter. Another existence. Another lifetime.Royal Botanic Gardens. Bursting with aromatic sweetness. Edinburgh in autumn. Hearts, overlapping. Sheltered.Under a canopy of burnished gold.It is a dream within a dream.I tried to walk away. I stumbled.Over and over again.When I finally did, I succeeded in leaving myself behind.The world crumbles. How does one exist as an empty shell?Memories of him.Of us. Of what we were. Of what was possible. Saturating my bones.Seven years. Survivorship. In a shadowy world. Tumbling in a restless void. Chipping away the fragmented soul. Was it a choice when there was none to be made?It is not that I have been happy or unhappy without him. It is not that I can or cannot live without him.It is because I am no longer capable of believing. The pain so neatly stitched into my soul is inconsequential.Cambridge. A sanctuary.A semblance of a life. A thriving career.Accommodating companion. A seemingly perfect existence.My insides have long been twisted and shredded. The darkness lurks. Threatens to engulf me. Yet again. Faith. No longer present to hold it at bay.Grief. Desire. Longing.If I crawled into myself I might not recognize what resides within.Chapter 1

On Borrowed TimeJamie/Claire Modern AU:The story of Claire Beauchamp, a feminist studies scholar and J.A.M.M Fraser, a playwright, spanning over a period of ten years between Cambridge, MA and Edinburgh, Scotland.As always, my gratitude goes to @notevenjokingfic for taking the time to provide invaluable suggestions.There shouldn’t be a formating issue on desktop but it is wonky with tumblr on mobile. I am obsessed with formatting because it is part of the storytelling. TeaserPrologue———————— Chapter 1 Edinburgh, Scotland 7 years agoScotland. Alba. The earthly dwelling of Gods. Of visible and tangible divinity.Legends, superstitions, and folklore. Sìthichean. Buidsichean. Kelpie. Brollachan. Selkie. Lusting. Roaming. Searching. Waiting. Betwixt worlds, neither here, nor there.Beanntan. Lochan. Tràighean. Glinn. Aibhnichean. Alba’s majestic landscape. Transporting souls into a spiritual realm. Loosening tongues into poetry. Healing. Ritualizing. Transforming. Rebirthing of the self.The past is intricately woven into the present, written into every brick and stone, a reminder that we live in the memory of history, reconstituting history as we encounter the present. If Scotland is magical, Edinburgh, with its classic architecture, narrow streets, hidden church yards, and passageways, is as romantic as it is adventurous. It is a city that sparks the imagination, emboldens the spirit, and dares the lonely heart to love.It is in this city that I, Claire Beauchamp, a British scholar, met J.A.M.M Fraser, the beloved playwright of modern Scotland. It is only fitting that Edinburgh—known since the 18th century as a “City of Letters” and synonymous with Arthur Conan Doyle, Robert Burns, Walter Scott, Muriel Spark, Naomi Mitchison, and JK Rowling—bears witness to the meeting of souls, a chance encounter that irrevocably changed the course of two lives.Jamie.  Jamie Fraser.  James Alexander Malcolm Mackenzie Fraser.The playwright. Correction. The beloved playwright of Scotland.  Edinburgh’s son. Local-boy-made-good.  After a decade of experiences in global theater scenes—New York, Toronto, Tokyo, Athens, Melbourne, Buenos Aires and Subotica—Jamie returned to Edinburgh, established his own theatrical production company (becoming a playwright-producer in the process), procured a space in an abandoned historical building, and dedicated his life to breathing new vision into the arts and culture of his hometown.He was beautiful and graceful.  Over six feet tall. Broad in proportion. Shoulder length curly reddish mane, a riot of blazing autumnal colors come alive.   Slanted blue eyes. Generous wide mouth. High cheekbones. Courtesy of his Viking forefathers.  Assertive, but without the arrogance of his species.  Perceptive, but without the liability that renders him a threat to masculine ethos.  This is a man who knows his worth.The body of a warrior.  The mind of an intellectual.  The upbringing of a gentleman.  The soul of a barbarian.He is still in me.My warrior.  My intellectual.  My gentleman.  My barbarian.  Mine.Was he ever?Will the haunting never cease?The familiarity.  Captivating. Spellbinding. Ethereal.  Of knowing someone.  Of recognizing someone.  Such a recognition, of being in the know, made words superfluous.Disquieting me. Disquieting him.  Disquieting us.  We who weave words for a living.A practical academic, I do not believe in fate, soulmates, and forever.  Words absent from my existence. Untested meaning-making. He breathed life into them.  He upended the core of my being.  The scaffolding that upholds Claire Beauchamp.The familiarity disassembles me.The familiarity.  A warning.  I flouted it. I rendered my heart vulnerable.  And my heart betrayed me.He is still in me.Chapter 2

On Borrowed Time: Christmas FicletEllen Fraser’s POVHe is bone weary. He has been staring at the Christmas tree for an inordinate amount of time. As if the answer he seeks is hidden within the sweeping branches or between the twinkling lights. His body is here but his mind has wondered elsewhere. He is with the one he yearns for. The one who quiets his mind. Steals laughter from his lips. Nourishes his soul. Owns his heart.I put a gentle hand on his shoulder and squeeze. He looks up with a rueful smile. His eyes are raw. Glistening with unshed tears. He has nothing to hide.“Have ye called her?”“Nah.”“Do ye want to?”“Yes…no…yes…I dinnae ken. I need to. I want to…but I shouldn’t. Her life is her own now.”“Ye are no longer my wee bairn and ye ken yer own heart, but she is yours and ye are hers. ‘Tis clear as day to me.”“‘Tis no enough for her. No enough for us. I canna make her see reason.”“She’s afraid. Ye ken this. Yer lifestyle now and yer career, both of yer careers might be too much for anyone to handle, let alone someone who has a history of troubling relationships. She is strong lass who kens her mind. But sometimes her strength is her greatest enemy.”He looks at me with pleading eyes. The eyes of a boy who needs reassurance that his mother will make the world right again. “Tell me what to do, mam.”“I canna, mo mhac. Ye ken yer heart. Ye ken hers. Ye ken the answer.”She loves him something fierce. Of that I am certain. For I have lived that love and Jamie is the product of such transcendental experience. He cherishes her more than his own life. He glows with happiness in her company. Their souls sing to each other. She is his everything. That much is obvious to a mother. But will it be enough to sustain the trials and tribulations of a relationship that has played out in the public eye from the very beginning? For his sake as well as hers, I hope they find each other again. If not in this life, perhaps, in the next.
