    Summary
  He is whatever puts Thomas first. But that changes so often that he doesn’t know what he is beyond that.
   He is Janus when he is alone, but only when he is not someone else.   Janus has never minded the fact that his identity is fluid, ever-changing. He acts as whoever Thomas needs him to be in the moment, and if that means he doesn't know much about himself as an individual, well. It's never been a problem for him.Until he gives away his name, and then it very much is.

    Summary
      Izuku Midoriya was always a strong child.In spite of his tears, his childlike innocence, and that go-getter fanboy attitude, his inner strength drove him to seek out the chance to save people. He dared to dream he might one day be able to give people hope, just like All Might gave him hope.That dream, that hope, and those leaky eyes are beginning to dry up, as his faith is called into question. But that inner strength still remains. And now it begins to flare with a dangerous new strength. The question now is who it will burn.In the pursuit of information on All Might, Izuku gets mixed up with the villainous side of society. Taken under their wing, for better or for worse, his life might never be the same.

    Summary
      Dabi caught the heavy packet of papers that Shouto shoved at his chest. "What's this?""That's from Fuyumi," said Shouto. "Ten years' worth of medical insurance forms, unpaid library fines, your immunization card and dental record, five years' worth of incomplete tax returns --""Good thing I'm not Todoroki Touya," smirked Dabi, shoving the papers back at Shouto. He got a raised white eyebrow reminiscent of Fuyumi herself in response. "You're disowning us because you don't want to do your taxes?"---The Todoroki kids are convinced that Dabi is one of them, and now Shouto won't  leave Dabi alone.
