    Summary
      Diego shot a quick glance at Five before turning his gaze back to the road. "You wanna explain what happened, or should I?"Five shook out his hand.  Apparently thirteen year old fists were not made for knocking out grown men.  or, the one where Five punches people, Diego follows his lead and Klaus just wants his skirts.
