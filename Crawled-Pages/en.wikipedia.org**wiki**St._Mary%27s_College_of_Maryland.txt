The college is located in St. Mary's City, Maryland[3][7] and shares much of its campus with Historic St. Mary's City, the site of Maryland's first colony and first capital. It is also the site of the fourth colony in British North America.
The Historical Archaeology Field School is jointly operated by St. Mary's College of Maryland and Historic St. Mary's City.[11][12][11][12] The campus and the rest of St. Mary's City combined are considered to be one of the premier archaeological sites in the United States.[11]
In 2020, U.S. News and World Report's annual "Best Colleges and Universities" report ranked St. Mary's College as the 5th best "Public Liberal Arts College" in the country; St. Mary's was tied for #92 in the "National Liberal Arts Colleges" category, which includes private schools.[13]

History[edit]
Main article: History of St. Mary's College of MarylandSt. Mary's College of Maryland is located on the original site of Maryland's first colony, St. Mary's City,[12]  which was also the first capital of Maryland[14] and is considered to be the birthplace of religious freedom in America.[15][16]
Colonial St. Mary's City was actually only a town and at its peak had between 500 and 600 residents. However, as the colony quickly expanded and settlements spread throughout the Eastern part of what is now Maryland, the town remained the capital and representatives would travel from all over the colony to participate in the Maryland General Assembly, the colony's first legislative body.
The Colony was founded under a mandate by the colonial proprietor, Cecil Calvert, the second Lord Baltimore of England, that the new settlers engage in religious tolerance of each other.[16][17][18] The first settlers were both Protestant and Catholic during a time of persecution of Catholics.[18] This mandate was unprecedented at the time, as England had been wracked by religious conflict for centuries.
Academics[edit]
  Goodpaster and Schafer Halls on the campus of St. Mary's College of Maryland. They are named, respectively, after General Andrew J. Goodpaster, the former Superintendent of the United States Military Academy and William Donald Schafer, the former Governor of Maryland. Both men were very involved in the ongoing development of St. Mary's College of Maryland and each served on its Board of Trustees for years.
St. Mary's College of Maryland offers over 31 different undergraduate degrees and minors, and it has a masters program in education. It is a public honors college,[9][10] one of only two such colleges in the United States. As such, it maintains a core honors-level curriculum[19] that all of its students, regardless of major, must complete.
The college is non-religious (secular) and has been since it was started in 1840 (The name St. Mary's commemorates Maryland's first colony, "St. Mary's City", which once stood where the college stands now). It has been coeducational (both male and female students) since 1949.
St. Mary's Way principles[edit]
The college community is guided by a set of principles called "The St. Mary's Way".[20][21] These principles intend to cultivate a supportive, caring environment where a passion for curiosity, knowledge and discovery can flourish.[20][21] This set of principles also stresses the importance of making a difference in the world, informed by the natural beauty and historic meaning of the St. Mary's City area.[20][21] The St. Mary's Way also sets a tone for integrity and tolerance of differences in viewpoint, background and experience.[20][21]
The text of the St. Mary's Way is as follows:[20][21]

St. Mary's College of Maryland lies in a setting of natural beauty and historic meaning which enhances our ability to reflect on our lives in an increasingly complex, technological, and interdependent world. As a member of St. Mary's College of Maryland, I accept the St. Mary's Way and agree to join in working with others to develop this College as a community:
Where people respect the natural environment and the tradition of tolerance which is the heritage of this place
Where people cultivate a life-long quest for disciplined learning and creativity
Where people take individual responsibility for their work and actions
Where people foster relationships based upon mutual respect, honesty, integrity, and trust
Where people are engaged in an ongoing dialogue that values differences and the unique contributions of others' talents, backgrounds, customs, and world views
Where people are committed to examining and shaping the functional, ethical values of our changing world
Where people contribute to a spirit of caring and an ethic of service.
By choosing to join this community, I accept the responsibility of helping to build on its past heritage, of living its ideals, and contributing to its future.[20][21] 
Degrees[edit]
The college has 31 undergraduate programs that allow a choice of 24 majors,[3] leading to a Bachelor of Arts (BA),[3] and 26 minors.[7] 69% of St. Mary's students major or minor in a second academic discipline. Popular degree programs include biology, economics, English, history, political science, and psychology.[3] The college also has the possibility for students to develop their own major, a Student Designed Major.[22]
The college also offers a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT).[3] including teacher certification[3][7]

As of 2010 there were 69 African-American faculty at the school, including 57 full-time and 12 part-time professors and instructors. The school's President since 2014, Doctor Tuajuanda Jordan, is also a person of African-American heritage.

African-American student enrollment[edit]
African-American student enrollment at St. Mary's College dropped in recent years. Rising tuition and need for more state funding for first generation to college students has been cited as a key reason. This includes a drop from 14% African American student enrollment in 1992[37] to just 7% African-American student enrollment in 2013[38]
The school has been working in many areas to improve enrollment and has numerous financial aid programs for minorities, and is reaching out to African-American communities across the state. The schools goal is to greatly increase African-American student enrollment.
In the spring of 2014 a report shows the African-American student population having increased to 8%.
Research has shown that, due to the relatively recent history of segregation in the United States, available funding for "first generation to college" students affects African-American populations disproportionally—Many news sources mention that adequate funding for first generation college students is actually one of the very biggest issues behind lagging African-American enrollment—elite liberal arts college's which are viewed by the state of Maryland as St. Mary's College's competitors, have been described in the news media as having traditionally had bigger endowments and could offer more scholarships.
In response to this concern, the school has been doing considerable work to increase African-American enrollment at St. Mary's College:
The school has worked to improve its outreach to minority students throughout the state.
Numerous financial aid programs are available through the financial aid office regardless of student background as well as information on accessing minority scholarships and grants.[39]
First generation students of all backgrounds have numerous funding options available through the college.[39] The college also has information on additional sources.[39]
The school just received a top national ranking for on-campus race and class relations. It has been ranked 12th in the Nation for positive race and class relations on campus. This is based on student reporting that shows their feelings about relationships between student on campus of different races and economic classes (family of origin income).
News articles report that African-American students on campus have a strong, active and supportive community.
The school has several programs that can assist minority students seeking support.
To be generally more competitive, the school secured a lowering of its tuition from the state in 2014.

However, in addition to this, since 1840, the school has been charged by the state in various capacities in researching,[54] interpreting and memorializing Maryland history at the site of Maryland's first colony and capitol,[54] St. Mary's City, Maryland,[54] which is also where the college is located.[54]
Historical Archaeology Field School[edit]
In this capacity St. Mary's College of Maryland, in partnership with Historic St. Mary's City,[12][55][56] also runs the Historical Archaeology Field School[12][55] which is an internationally recognized institution.[12]  The field school has worked on over 300 archaeological dig sites in the St. Mary's City area over the last 40 years.[12]
Special areas of archaeological research and historical study[edit]
The school has a deep and multilayered relationship to the St. Mary's City area and its historic landscape.
In its special role as a historical and archaeological research institution charged with studying the founding history of Maryland, and charged by the State of Maryland with researching the history of the emergence of democracy in Maryland, St. Mary's College of Maryland studies the following historic events that occurred in the area of St. Mary's City, Maryland and the periods in which they occurred.
This also includes premier museums on and near campus, highlighting archaeology and area history related to all of the above.
School's inspirational historic grounding[edit]
This research also includes a special focus and draws inspiration from local milestone historical events related to the struggle for establishment of democracy in Maryland,[54] in many of its aspects,[54] including:
The early development of representative legislature in Maryland.[54]
The historic struggle for the establishment of religious freedom in America.[54]
The historic beginnings of the quest for Women's suffrage in America[54]
The historic struggle for minority rights in America[54]
The beginnings of freedom of the press in the Southern colonies[54]
Institutions[edit]
The Center for the Study of Democracy[edit]
  Margaret Brent Hall on the campus of St. Mary's College of Maryland. Named for Margaret Brent who, on the site of what is now the college, was the first woman to petition for the right to vote in America (in the Maryland Assembly in 1648).
The Center for the Study of Democracy is an interdisciplinary joint initiative of St. Mary's College of Maryland and Historic St. Mary's City.[56][57] 
It explores historical and contemporary issues related to democracy and also provides presentations by government officials and other leaders from both developed and developing countries[58] and notable scholars.[57][58] The Center also offers a Democracy Studies minor through St. Mary's College of Maryland.
Colonial St. Mary's City, which was on the site where St. Mary's College of Maryland is located today, was a place where struggles over 'Liberty of conscience' in religion,[16] representative political practices,[18][59] freedom of the press, and minority rights all came to the fore at various times. Utilizing early Maryland as a case study in "emerging democracy," the foundation works to apply the lessons of the region's history to a domestic and international discussion of democracy's role in the modern world.[56][57] The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) We the People initiative awarded the Center a $500,000 challenge grant in September 2004.[60]
Notable advisory board members include:
Steny Hoyer, U.S. Representative and House Majority Leader, United States Congress[45][61]

The James P. Muldoon River Center is a biological research center located along the Saint Mary's River. The center administers the Saint Mary's River Project and the university's geothermal operations.
The Slackwater Center[edit]
The Slackwater Center studies the current events, culture and history of St. Mary's County and other rural Chesapeake bay and Southern Maryland communities.[63][64]  Its focus is interdisciplinary and it studies the region from both an historical and contemporary point of view.[63][65]
The center studies, records and documents as well as interprets and reports on current and historical life in Chesapeake Bay communities.[63][65]  The center also has a public education mission. Students engage in historical research and historical interpretation as well as documenting oral histories[63][66] of living residents.[63] The center utilizes interdisciplinary collaboration[63] and also fosters public education and debate.
It also publishes the Slackwater Journal[65]  and maintains an extensive archive.[56][63]
The center's mission statement says: "We aim to offer a closer look at the rich and complicated legacies of the past, at the social and environmental challenges facing the present, and at our collective visions for the future."[67]
Slackwater Archives[edit]
Preservational and curatorial roles are also played by the Slackwater Center, primarily through the Slackwater Archives and the Slackwater Southern Maryland Documentation Project.[63]
The mission of the archives includes preserving, transcribing, analyzing and interpreting:[63]
Southern Maryland Documentation Project (The only work and collection of its kind in the region that includes extensive oral histories of the region, preserving local history and documenting community issues still unfolding as current events in Southern Maryland).[63]

Historic St. Mary's City Commission[edit]
  The St. John's Site[69][70] (on the campus of St. Mary's College of Maryland):[70] One of the most historic spots in Maryland[71] and possibly North America.[70][71] The first Maryland General Assembly (the Maryland colony's first legislative body) met here,[71] one of the earliest laws protecting religious freedom was written and passed here,[70] possibly the first African American to serve in a legislative body in American history[72] served and voted here,[71] the first demand in America for a women's right to vote occurred here,[71] an early colonial governor lived here[71] and the first treaties between the Maryland colonists and the Susquehanna Indian Nation where ironed out here as well.[71]
  Archaeology museum[70] at the St. John's-Site on campus of St.Mary's College of Maryland.[70] With over 200 archaeological sites within 2 miles of the campus,[73] St. Mary's College students of history, archaeology, American politics, African American studies and also students in the Museum Curator Degree Program can take hands-on courses in archaeological excavation (taking part in real life archaeological digs),[12] as well as hands on experience with artifact analysis[12] and preservation[12] as well as museum curator work and historic interpretation. The Baltimore Sun has called the area around St. Mary's College "an archaeological jewel."[12] 
Historic St. Mary's City, which sits next to the college, is a State-run archaeological research, historical research, preservation and interpretation center and an indoor and outdoor museum complex.[56]  The area managed by the commission also includes a reconstructed colonial town and sailing ship, located on the historic site of Maryland's first colony.[56]
St. Mary's College and Historic St. Mary's City jointly coordinate programs of study[56]  in archaeology, history, museum studies, African American studies, political science and theater.  This includes both classroom and also hands-on opportunities in archaeological excavations, museums,[12] and historic interpretation work.[74]
The commission and its grounds are considered to be is a major center for colonial archaeological research and historical research in the United States.[11] There have been over 200 archaeological digs in St. Mary's City worked on by the school over the last 30 years.[12]
All St. Mary's Students may also attend St. Mary's City's public access historical sites and all of its museums for free, year round.[75]
The Maryland Heritage Project[edit]
The Maryland Heritage Project is also a collaboration between St. Mary's College of Maryland and Historic St. Mary's City.[56] It focuses on the reconstruction of colonial buildings in the Historic St. Mary's City living history area,[56] ongoing development of St. Mary's museum exhibits,[56] and also indoor and outdoor historic interpretation.[56]
This involves ongoing projects in archaeological research[56] (including working on active archaeological excavations),[56] historical research as well as management, preservation and analysis and interpretation of period artifacts and documents. The project also provides hands-on as well as classroom studies in archaeology, anthropology, democracy studies, history, international languages and cultures, and museum studies.

Campus traditions[edit]
  The Garden of Remembrance, one of the campus "Seven Wonders" and a popular spot for weddings as well as for students to study.
Signing of the book: New students attend a convocation ceremony at the State House of 1634 in Historic St. Mary's City. Afterwards students are invited to sign the President's book.

Mardi-Greens, occurs the weekend near Mardi Gras, is an annual all-student celebration.
Nudi-Greens, occurs towards the end of April or early May, is an all-student ABC celebration for Spring.
The Great Bamboo Boat Race takes place during Homecoming/Parent's Weekend. Teams must make a boat entirely out of materials provided for them (bamboo, sheet plastic, twine, and duct tape) and race it in a small loop on the St. Mary's River by the college boathouse and docks. The bamboo is harvested from the campus bamboo forest, where it is considered an invasive species. There are cash prizes for the winners. This event replaced The Great Cardboard Boat Race (an earlier incarnation using cardboard instead of bamboo) in 2010.
The Mardi Gras Parade, a senior tradition, where students parade around campus on the night of Mardi Gras to the beat of pots and pans.
World Carnival Weekend takes place late in the Spring semester. Clubs across campus are invited to participate in this event which celebrates diversity in music, food, and culture.
The Frisbee Golf Dorchester Open is held in the Spring (held for 37 consecutive years, a big alumni event, current students play as well).
Midnight breakfast is held during finals week each semester. Admission is free, and many students participate in karaoke during the night.

Polar Bear Splash: an annual effort to raise awareness for Global Warming. More than one hundred students take a swim in the freezing St. Mary's River during this mid-winter event.[94]
Shoe Tree: For a lot of students, throwing a pair of shoes or flip-flops tied together into the shoe tree marks a memorable "first time" on the college campus—i.e. losing one's virginity.[95]
Natty Boh Hunt: On Easter, the upperclassmen prepare the Natty Boh Hunt by buying large quantities of National Bohemian and spray painting them and hiding them all around campus for the freshmen to find.  An Occasional 40 will be bought and spray painted gold, known as a Golden 40.
May Day Bicycle Streak: On May 1 (May Day) students streak through campus on bicycles. This represents freedom, especially for seniors. Clothed students stand on the sidelines and "offer support".
Wednesday night Hide-A-Keg: On balmy Wednesday nights, a keg would be hidden somewhere on campus. First observed in 1988, the hunt would start (for both students and campus security) with a ringing of the bell. This tradition is no longer practiced, as kegs were banned on campus in the interest of student safety.
Friction Fest: Every April the SMCM Rock Climbing Club sponsors a huge Bouldering (rock climbing) competition called "Friction Fest" which is free and open to both students, staff, faculty, community and the local Navy Base members.
Seven Wonders[edit]
The Seven Wonders are seven notable campus landmarks.  New students are inducted into the traditions of SMCM by orientation leaders in a tour of the Seven Wonders during orientation and it is a graduation tradition for the departing class to tour the seven wonders and recount stories the evening before graduation. Thus a student's time at SMCM begins and ends with tours of the Seven Wonders.
The seven "wonders" are:
The Shoe Tree (see above)
The Bell Tower
A clearing on St. John's Pond on the Side of Queen Ann (see above)
Maryland Freedom of Conscience Statue on Route 5 (a.k.a. The Naked Man)
Garden of Remembrance Fountain

St. Mary's College's groundskeeping crews implement sustainable practices, including protecting the St. Mary's River by developing green buffer areas, creating green spaces and wildlife habitat, using integrated pest management and minimizing  synthetic fertilizers.[97] SMCM has applied to the Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary Program.[97]
St. Mary's College is expanding its recycling and composting programs.[97] Student volunteers have been collecting recyclable and compostable material from the residences.[97] Compostable bins will soon be available all across campus.[97] 
Energy conservation[edit]
By upgrading fixtures, adjusting campus facilities operations and raising the campus community awareness about wasteful energy usage, St. Mary's College is making progress in using energy more efficiently, containing energy expenditures and reducing its impact on the environment.[97]
St. Mary's College students voted to create a Green Energy Fund by raising student fees $25 per year.[97] The purpose of the Green Energy Fund is to purchase Renewable Energy Credits to offset 100% of the College's electricity use and fund renewable energy projects on campus.[97] St. Mary's College received the 2008 EPA Green Power Leadership Club award for their efforts.[97]
