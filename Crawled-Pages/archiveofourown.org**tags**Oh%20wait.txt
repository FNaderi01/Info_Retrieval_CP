    Summary
      A multitude of (mostly) extremely short stories focusing around characters from the Thor/Avengers universe, that refused to sit silently in my brain and instead rebelled and caused general skullduggery and chaos until I wrote them down. 
Most are so short it would be just silly to write them all as seperate stories, so I've decided to bundle them all up here nice and neat and out of the way.
Be warned: most of these revolve around Loki. I feel at times like he is my unwilling and usually unwanted muse. I try to write him out of my brain, and then he goes 'What? You want me gone? Well, if you want me to leave that changes everything. Now I'm staying right here. Deal with it."
So yeah. Lots of Loki.

    Creator Chose Not To Use Archive Warnings No Archive Warnings Applypast Pepper Potts/Tony Stark - Relationship Steve Rogers &amp; Tony StarkTony Stark Mentions of the other Avengers mentions of Pepper PottsBreaking &amp; Entering Tony is ten steps from self-destruction But it stops manifesting Then he gets angry He should be a frost giant with the way he gets angry I'm sooo amusing Oh wait Break Up I should stop tagging now Author regrets nothing
    Summary
      This was written as a response to an avengerkink prompt. I would recommend you reading the full prompt as I've narrowed it down considerably.   Tony, for whatever reason, has locked himself in his lab and just wants to be left alone. However, Steve (or whomever would have the capability of breaking into the lab) decides that that's not what Tony needs and ends up breaking the glass, smashing down the door, picking and disabling the locks, whatever. Only, instead of everything being sunshine and daisies and the property damage is okay as well as the lack of respect for the solitude wish, it's not okay. Tony really did need the solitude and being busted in on upset him further. On top of that, there's the property damage. That Tony will have to pay for. And his lab won't be secure until it's fixed and he's got classified projects in there. Not to mention, thanks for respecting his wishes, really. You can also find the earlier version of the story there by scrolling down or clicking here.

    Summary
      "Hello, master." Louis purred, crawling over to the end of the bed on all fours.Harry was in pure shock, gaping as Louis ran his hands over his tanned chest and down his stomach. His boyfriend was hot, no doubt about it, and the things he was doing to Harry- it was so unfair."L-Louis," Harry choked out, adjusting his cock in his jeans. "What- What're you doing?" Harry asked, his heartbeat quickening as Louis got up off of the bed and sauntered over to him, swinging his hips seductively with each step.Harry stood still as Louis got closer, until he was only inches from his body. "You're in control, Harry. I'm yours for the rest of the night. Do whatever you want with me-" Louis leaned forward, standing on his toes as his lips brushed against his ear. "Sir..."Or when Louis seduces Harry in lace panties and Harry really likes being in control

    Summary
      Telling himself to man up, to grow up, and to accept life as it had been presented to him rather than taking the reins on his own life, could only push him so far. David had torn him down to such a shrivelled version of himself that it repulsed him, without even doing anything. Zayn insisted it wasn’t Louis’ fault, that David was suffocating him, with his words and actions. Louis had every right to live his own life. Of course he did.This wasn’t his fault.*~*~*After escaping a relationship that left him suffocated and cynical of love, Louis Tomlinson returns to London, and bumps into who could most definitely be the love of his life. Fluff, angst, and a whole lotta silly boys in love ensue.

    Summary
      “Why don’t you look at your Daddy, princess? Let him see how flushed and pretty your face looks.” Louis purred, grabbing Harry’s chin and tilting it to his face, lowly gasping as their eyes connected. Harry was wearing mascara. And eyeliner. And what looked to be a light pink eyeshadow.Fuck. orHarry and Louis have been apart for far too long, Harry gets off on age difference (don't we all???) and Louis is the best Daddy ever.
