The antiope preview is now an official part of the API. These preview headers are no longer required. The Checks API endpoints no longer require the antiope preview header.
application/vnd.github.antiope-preview+json
For more information, see the "Checks API."
Thanks again to everyone that tried out these API features during the preview period.

  GitHub Actions API - Introducing workflow usage endpoints
    May 15, 2020
      gimenete
GitHub Actions is available with GitHub Free, GitHub Pro, GitHub Free for organizations, GitHub Team, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub One. GitHub Actions is not available for private repositories owned by accounts using legacy per-repository plans. For more information, see GitHub's products in the GitHub Help documentation.
We've added two new endpoints to the GitHub Actions API that provide insight into the billable time used by your workflows.
The following endpoints are now available for you to use:
Get workflow usage
Get workflow run usage
We've released these endpoints into public beta. We may change aspects of these endpoints based on developer feedback.
If we do, we will announce the changes here on the developer blog, but we will not provide any advance notice.
If you have any questions or feedback, please let us know!
  Introducing the skipped check run and check suite conclusion
    May 8, 2020
      joshmgross
If a check run or suite is never started, you'll see the skipped conclusion. This is a common check run conclusion for GitHub Actions that have a job using an if condition.
We created the skipped conclusion to help distinguish this type of scenario from when a check run or suite is cancelled. A check run or suite has the cancelled conclusion when the check run was planned or started but then stopped. For example, a conclusion can be cancelled due to manual intervention or possibly some service issues that cause the check run to stop.
  Suspending GitHub App installations
    May 1, 2020
      tarebyte
Before you could suspend a GitHub App, if an organization admin or user wanted to temporarily block an app's access to their repositories' resources, they could only uninstall the GitHub App completely. This has been particularly challenging for large organizations that may need thousands of people to reauthorize an app.
Now you can suspend a GitHub App's access to your resources for as long as you need and unsuspend the app's access when you're ready. When you suspend a GitHub App you've installed, the app cannot access your resources, the GitHub API, or webhook events.
The integrator who owns and maintains a GitHub app, also called a GitHub App owner, can suspend or unsuspend a GitHub App installation using these REST API endpoints with a JWT: 
PUT /app/installations/:installation_id/suspended
DELETE /app/installations/:installation_id/suspended
People who have installed a GitHub App, also called installation owners, can suspend or unsuspend a GitHub App through their app's installation settings. Before people can suspend a GitHub app installation, the GitHub App owner must opt-in to the beta release. For more information, see "Suspending a GitHub App installation."
  Expiring user-to-server access tokens for GitHub Apps
    April 30, 2020
      jakewilkins
Starting today owners of GitHub Apps can choose to have their user-to-server access tokens expire after 8 hours. Expiring user-to-server access tokens help to enforce regular token rotation and reduce the impact of a compromised token.
You can opt-in to this security feature in your App's Settings page under the Beta Features tab.
Once enabled, GitHub will provide a refresh token when your app creates a user-to-server token.
{
  "access_token": "accesstoken",
  "expires_in": "28800",
  "refresh_token": "r1.refreshme",
  "refresh_token_expires_in": "15811200",
  "scope": "",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
This refresh token is valid for 6 months and can be exchanged for a fresh user-to-server access token (valid for another 8 hours) and a new refresh token:
POST /login/oauth/access_token HTTP/1.1
Host: github.com
grant_type=refresh_token
refresh_token=r1.refreshme
&amp;client_id=xxxxxxxxxx
&amp;client_secret=xxxxxxxxxx
For more information, see "Refreshing user-to-server access tokens."
  Replacing the GitHub Apps "Creating an installation access token" endpoint
    April 15, 2020

      jakewilkins
We are announcing the deprecation plan of the previously deprecated "Create an installation access token" endpoint: POST /installations/:installation_id/access_tokens.
The supported replacement endpoint is named consistently with other GitHub Apps API endpoints and has been available since 2018.
Deprecation Timeline
Brownouts
During a brownout, calls to the old version of this endpoint will temporarily fail. The goal is to trigger alerts (assuming there are any) on our customers' services to help find unmigrated endpoint calls.
The brownouts are scheduled for:
August 1 2020
From 07:00 UTC to 10:00 UTC
From 16:00 UTC to 19:00 UTC
September 1 2020
From 07:00 UTC to 10:00 UTC
From 16:00 UTC to 19:00 UTC
Removal Date
The legacy "Create an installation access token" endpoint will be disabled at the earliest on October 1 2020.
Changes to make
Replace all uses of the deprecated endpoint for creating an installation token for a GitHub App with the new endpoint:
POST /app/installations/:installation_id/access_tokens
If you have any questions or feedback, please let us know!
  Replacing the integration_installation and integration_installation_repositories webhook events
    April 15, 2020
      jakewilkins
      jamesmartin
We are announcing the deprecation of two legacy GitHub Apps-related webhook events:
integration_installation
integration_installation_repositories
These events have been undocumented for some time and will be removed on the following timeline.
Deprecation Timeline
Brownouts
During a brownout, the deprecated events will not be sent. The goal is to trigger alerts (assuming there are any) on our customers' services to help find unmigrated event subscriptions. If this brownout is causing significant disruptions for your service, please contact support.
The brownouts are scheduled for:
August 1 2020
From 07:00 UTC to 10:00 UTC
From 16:00 UTC to 19:00 UTC
September 1 2020
From 07:00 UTC to 10:00 UTC
From 16:00 UTC to 19:00 UTC
Removal date
The legacy integration_installation and integration_installation_repositories events will no longer be sent after October 1 2020.
Changes to make
Replace all uses of the integration_installation and integration_installation_repositories events with the new events:
installation
installation_repositories
If you have any questions or feedback, please let us know!
  Expanding REST API support for triage and maintain roles
    April 7, 2020
      Oneill38
We are expanding support for the triage and maintain permissions in the REST API. Users with the triage or maintain permissions can now use endpoints that reflect what they can do in a repository, such as adding a label to an issue. Additionally, these new permissions can now be granted and managed via the API and will show up as assigned roles in API responses.
For more information about these roles, see "Repository permission levels for an organization" in the GitHub Help documentation.
Endpoints you can access with the triage permission
POST /repos/:owner/:repo/issues/:issue_number/labels
DELETE /repos/:owner/:repo/issues/:issue_number/labels/:name
POST /repos/:owner/:repo/issues/:issue_number/assignees
DELETE /repos/:owner/:repo/issues/:issue_number/assignees
POST /repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/:pull_number/requested_reviewers
Endpoints you can access with the maintain permission
PUT /repos/:owner/:repo/topics
PUT /repos/:owner/:repo/interaction-limits
All of the endpoints that you can use with the triage permission role:
POST /repos/:owner/:repo/issues/:issue_number/labels
DELETE /repos/:owner/:repo/issues/:issue_number/labels/:name
POST /repos/:owner/:repo/issues/:issue_number/assignees
DELETE /repos/:owner/:repo/issues/:issue_number/assignees
POST /repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/:pull_number/requested_reviewers
Endpoints to assign, update, or view permissions
These endpoints will now work to manage the triage and maintain permissions.
PUT /repos/:owner/:repo/collaborators/:username
GET /repos/:owner/:repo/invitations
PATCH /repos/:owner/:repo/invitations/:invitation_id
GET /user/repository_invitations
GET /orgs/:org/teams/:team_slug/repos/:owner/:repo
PUT /orgs/:org/teams/:team_slug/repos/:owner/:repo
GET /orgs/:org/teams/:team_slug/repos

shadow-cat preview graduates
To create a draft pull request or see whether a pull request is in a draft state, you no longer need to use the shadow-cat preview.
application/vnd.github.shadow-cat-preview+json
For more information about the affected endpoints, see the "Pull Requests API."
Thanks again to everyone that tried out these API features during the preview period.
