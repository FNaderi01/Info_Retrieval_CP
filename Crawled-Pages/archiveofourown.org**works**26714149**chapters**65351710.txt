    Chapter Text
    A few days after Kibo got the results, she moved into an apartment. Even though Hosu was only an hour away from Mustafu, it would take longer to go to U.A. And Jiji-nee couldn't move with her, because her dojo was in Hosu. Hence, the decision to get an apartment. At the beginning, Kibo thought it was a good idea; it would teach her to about being independent. But no one could have expected her accidentally causing a kitchen fire. And breaking the kettle. And burning three of the kitchen gloves. And— well, you get the idea.

 “Kibo, how do you manage to be so bad at cooking?”“I don’t know, okay!?”The next few weeks were divided up between reading books, reading fanfiction, and visiting her younger brother. Her brother, Shizuka, lived in Mustafu Hospital. When they escaped from their father’s house, he had lost so much blood that he went into a coma. The trauma suppressed all memories of the past, and since he had been in a coma for so long— six months— he had trouble speaking, and saying sentences. He found it easier to sign, which was why Jiji-nee and Kibo both learnt JSL.To be honest, Kibo was jealous of Shizuka. He could forget all about their past, about their father, about their mother, about everything, but she couldn’t. She had to wake up in the morning, see herself in front of a mirror, and immediately be reminded of him. Shizuka didn’t.
  “Go on,” A man in a gold suit taunted, “Go further.”
  Kibo looked at him anxiously, then took a step forward. And screamed.
Kibo’s eyes flew open. She sat up, and examined her shaky hands. It was just a nightmare, she tells herself. Her hands continue shaking.

  “Ok, so the first thing you do is—“
  “Go on,” The man taunts, “Go further.”
  Kibo steps forward, and screams.
“Go on,” he taunts, “Go further.”
  ’Stop’ Kibo thinks, ‘don’t go!’
  Kibo  ｓｃｒｅａｍｓ
Kibo wakes up in a cold sweat for the fifth night in a row.Kibo stares at herself in the mirror. She stares at the scars. Then, slowly, remembering what Jiji-nee had said, she puts make-up on her skin.Kibo looks at the books on her bookshelf. Most of them are pre-quirk books, but there are a set of books that are different from the rest. They are covered in dust, and look faintly like notebooks. Kibo takes a step forward, hand reaching out towards the old books, and quickly pulls it back.Not today, she thinks.Kibo wakes up at five am, and for once, it is not because of a nightmare. It’s May 1, the day that classes at U.A start. She wakes up, and sees a message on her phone. 
  Jiji-nee: 
Good luck, kiddo!Knock ‘em dead Kibo smiles, and climbs out of bed. She needs to get ready for school.
        Notes:
          Ok, so tell me your thoughts about this chapter!! I know I didn’t include her going to U.A yet, but I figured since there was so much going on here, it wouldn’t make sense to fit it in. Also, May 1 isn’t actually the day term 1 at U.A starts, i just made it up. Leave kudos, comments, and enjoy!!
