Fitness for Service
Becht’s online fitness-for-service software (BechtFFS) is the key resource for any plant or corporate engineer. BechtFFS is a powerful platform for evaluating the state of equipment which has developed defects in service. An FFS assessment will provide a recommendation on whether a damaged component must be removed from service or if an operation can safely continue. BechtFFS evaluations will allow you to operate equipment with confidence and will help you to prevent costly unplanned outages.
