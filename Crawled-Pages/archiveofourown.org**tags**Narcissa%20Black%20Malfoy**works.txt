    Summary
      "I was told to come to you if I needed something done." "Well, what do you need?" ~~Hope Ivy Potter had been witness to a lot of things. She was the eldest Potter child, with her younger brother, Charlus, being the 'Boy-Who-Lived'. For as long as she could remember, Hope has been dragged to many magical fundraisers and ministry balls, which wouldn't have been an awful occurrence  if her parents ever gave her the time of day. Ever since escaping death and Charlus being crowned the savior of the Wizarding World - James and Lily Potter, along with everyone else, forgot about their first born. And over time, Hope learned to bask in it. She was left alone by her parents, the media, and even the Order. Her parents weren’t worrying over her, or pushing her to do better in school like they do with her younger brothers. All the teen had to worry about was making sure her extra-curricular business ventures were kept underground and away from prying eyes. She was officially off the grid. But what happens when she bumps into the new lord thats been the talk of the summer at the Quidditch World Cup.

      He slid into the bench beside her. “I’ll meet you in the cupboard same time tomorrow. Maybe we’ll catch another rendezvous. And I’ll help you get to the bottom of this. If he really is your friend and this is all some kind of misunderstanding, I’ll be happy for you both, I solemnly swear. I don’t know when we started getting off on the wrong foot, Evans, but I want you to feel like you belong in your own house too.”Or: James and Lily are not friends, but we all know it's only a matter of time...

    Summary
      Lady Hermione Granger has been reared up in society, to marry well and be a good housewife, like any good Edwardian lady, but that's far from what she wants. When a handyman by the name of Ronald Weasley joins the house staff, utterly disarming her from the moment they first meet, he might just be the opportunity she needs to break loose and choose her own destiny.Lord Draco Malfoy has a secret— a dark, unforgivable secret he knows would cost him everything if it ever saw the light. But it's getting harder and harder to keep it from his father, because Draco keeps bumping into a pair of emerald eyes and a head of lush black hair, and he can't pretend his knees don't buckle at the sight. Which would be quite alright, if not for one small problem: it's not a woman they belong to.

    Summary
      A man is dead at Draco Malfoy's hands, and the consequences will reverberate for Sirius, for Harry, for the wizarding world entire, and, most of all, for Voldemort. It is not so easy, though, to forsake his parents and his old friends in Slytherin, as he is forced to choose what he will become and who he will leave behind. The only certainty left to Draco is his own power, which is becoming stronger and stranger and more and more dangerous. Almost as dangerous as how much he loves Harry Potter.

    Summary
      Everyone at Hogwarts tended to keep out of Minho Paek and Lana Black’s way - they were two Slytherins that people made sure not to get on the bad side of. No one wanted to mess with a known Death Eater’s son or the daughter of one of the Blacks. Both were two peas in a pod, making their way through Hogwarts with their heads held high and their voices silent. With the Dark Mark on his arm and insight into how Hogwarts was going to be run from now on, Minho and Lana have a plan of making things better. However, steering away from anything Potter puts his name on it seems unlikely. And for some reason, Lana has this ulterior motive that Minho can’t figure out either.

    Summary
      AMETHYSTHarry Potter X ReaderBook One - Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone In which the reader, Y/N Evangeline Amethyst, the last remaining descendant of the pure-blood Amethyst family line, meets the Boy Who Lived.This book will revolve around the growing friendship between you and the Golden Trio, as I feel quite uncomfortable declaring any kind of relationship otherwise between two children of so young. Their romantic relationship will blossom further later in the series, most likely the third book rather than first. I still suggest reading the first and second though for lore purposes and character and relationship progression.Enjoy &lt;3Odette Elodie
