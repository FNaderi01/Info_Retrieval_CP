    Summary
      Peter Parker, a.k.a Spiderman is dealing with some problems after the homecoming event. He didn't know how to ask for help and who to ask for that help. Good thing Tony Stark is here to help out. So, what would happen if both of them realized that they cared for each other like a father and son and started to live their life as one? What would happen when an old teammates suddenly  barge in their life? What about that new kid that Peter knew from his childhood? Most importantly, why is Vulture here?

    Summary
      Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist Tony Stark climbed up the steps to stand next to the podium, his brightest, most fake, smile plastered on his face. Internally, he was exhausted and numb to the attention that had been hoisted upon him since birth. He was tired of this superhero stuff, the politics, always cleaning up after SHIELD. Following orders was not his thing and after what he had seen on SHIELD's "private" server he wasn't so sure being an Avenger would work out...Oh well, he tried.THIS WORK IS CURRENTLY BEING REDONEI WILL BE POSTING NEW CHAPTERS BY 6/22/2020Chapters 1-8 are done!
