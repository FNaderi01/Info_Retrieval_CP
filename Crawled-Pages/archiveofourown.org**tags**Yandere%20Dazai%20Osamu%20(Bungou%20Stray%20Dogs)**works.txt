    Summary
      A missing person case that got the whole of France unsettled led a young, jaded reporter all the way from Paris to the distant town of Charleville, in hopes of unearthing just a single clue about this mystery.There she met a dollmaker, by the name of Osamu Dazai, and learned from him a thing or two about what love could do to a man.“You remind me of my partner a lot, actually,” was what the man had said. “Your eyes, that is. The same blue.”

    Summary
      “Isn’t it unfair? Just because you were lovers in your previous life, people expect you to automatically feel the same once you’re reincarnated? So you see, I’m merely being nice by helping you be free from such societal constraints.”“Your speech would be more convincing if you haven’t kidnapped me and aren’t waving a scalpel in front of my face.”[in a world where reincarnated lovers gaining their memories and getting back together are common occurrences, Dazai thinks that Chuuya deserves someone so much better than Fyodor]

    Summary
      Do not speak of the Devil, lest he shall appear.-His eyes slowly trailed over from him, to the people Chuuya was entertaining like a show dog. His smile turned bitter and sharp, gaze honing on the men, no, boys, who were staring at the other like he was heaven on earth.He stood up casually, all languid movements and relaxed smirks. His eyes darkened all the more.Chuuya was his dog, the only one he should be entertaining was him.

    Summary
      Atsushi didn't know what to think of the person he had met that day on the riverbank. The man was frighteningly strong despite his height. Had small alcohol tolerance despite his love for wine. Was bright and friendly despite his cursing. Was gentle and nice despite his dark past. Most of all, Atsushi didn't know what to think about the massive darkness that followed Chuuya. The shadow that came to Chuuya at night, whispering gentle and loving promises. The shadow that came to Chuuya at mornings, carving a path of blood. The shadow that gave Chuuya freedom, yet bound the man tighter and tighter in chains.--Or--A single twist of fate changed everything. The last person Oda Sakunosuke talked to wasn't Dazai but Chuuya. The person that left the Mafia wasn't Dazai but Chuuya. The person that met Atsushi at the bank that day wasn't Dazai but Chuuya. Chuuya embraced the light while Dazai shunned it.

    Summary
      “This is your punishment, you see? Because you dared to go against the fabric of the world.” Dazai says this with the sort of tenderness that he’s surprised to find himself capable, the type that slips past the third and fourth rib, the kind that’s less merciful than a stab to the heart. “Because you dared to try to leave me.”[or: BEAST AU divergence, where Chuuya breaks free from the Book’s influence and Dazai Does Not Approve][or: if the Book isn't enough to tie Chuuya down to this world, Dazai has to resort to other means, like giving Chuuya a child]

    Summary
      A mermaid AU in which Chuuya is an unconventional mermaid whose siren songs lead unsuspecting humans to their death and Dazai is a suicidal runaway that joins the mafia.~~~Forgetting was never an option. But he wants to forget, because he can’t stand the sight of those haunting eyes that pierce through him with such mystery. He can’t stand the hot winding in his belly, nor the acrid bile crawling up his throat each time he thinks of that formless creature lurking discreetly in the water. Since that night, he’s felt those sapphire eyes watching him, waiting in the dark corners of his mind. The unbearable feeling that he was riding on the cusp of enlightenment and terror—that he is deeply afraid of an endless, bottomless sea.

    Summary
      That one prompt about four aliens living together pretending to be human but with skk and sskk and they navigate living together while screwing up the plot and my sleep scheldule("It is rather unfortunate," Kouyou says eventually; Her next words are like a death sentence, "But as the other apartments are already occupied, the only one left is arranged to be shared by Nakajima Atsushi-kun over here, Akutagawa Ryunnosuke, Nakahara Chuuya and...Dazai Osamu."Well, Atsushi tells his inner rapidly rising feelings of certain doom, surely it can't get worse.And then, like an answer sent from the universe just to spite him, Akutagawa Ryuunosuke arrives and proves that, yes, things most certainly can get worse.There's no end to this suffering in sight - and it's only the first day.)

    Summary
      A sniffle made Dazai look up, blinking his one brown eye before he turned, holding the washcloth in his hands. He watched as his soulmate shook on the bed, hands clenched in his lap as his head bowed, seemingly in shame. Dazai frowned.  OR: After the battle with Shibusawa, Chuuya mourns.

    Summary
      Nakahara Chuuya found himself thrust into the world of violence and magic after getting himself almost kidnapped by what he later discovered to be the government, only to be saved by a boy who revealed himself to be from the mafia. As he fought to survive and keep himself safe from the hands of the government who apparently wanted him for his strong bloodline, he began to uncover his long buried past, where the key to stop this whole mess may lie. Unfortunately for Chuuya, the government wasn't the only organization after him.

    Summary
      “Possessive.”It wasn’t a word Dazai Osamu would use to describe himself, no. But it was a word often associated with his name.“An obsessed psycho,” they would say.“Poor Nakahara-san.”“That maniac is going to kill him someday.”

    Summary
      Atsushi Nakajima, a somewhat new detective, slacks off work one day in hopes that he can go get some food. When he does manage to scrape up enough change to buy a couple of riceballs, he sits beside the river to enjoy the view and sounds around him. The former which should not include a short figure floating face-down along it. As he is a morally decent person, he saves the boy, which leads to him being inducted into the same agency that Atsushi comes from. It's a big difference from the orphanage where the strange boy (who is actually older than Atsushi) lived and rigorously worked, but it's a pleasant change. Even if he isn't used to using his brain rather than his fists.But there's another mystery that even-newer-detective Chuuya has to solve, and perhaps the answer isn't too far from his new home.[[tags, warnings etc. may be updated as the story progresses.]]

    Summary
      Any evidence of Ability user A5158 and the god Arahabaki vanished in the wake of a terrible disaster in downtown Yokohama. With the ADA’s resources at his disposal, Dazai is determined to find the lost evidence even if it kills him. Which is an outcome Oda is trying rather hard to avoid.
With his partner Tachihara working deep cover within the Yokohama’s Port Mafia, it’s Chuuya’s job to ensure his safety from the shadows. Which is the perfect excuse to investigate the youngest Mafia Executive in history, who seems to have dropped off the radar. And who everyone seems desperate to keep him away from.
Dazai Osamu and Nakahara Chuuya have been hunting each other for years. It borders on obsession.
