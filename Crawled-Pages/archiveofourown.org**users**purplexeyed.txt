    Summary
      The Sentinel/Guide AU you didn't know you wanted. (Maybe.)Raleigh Becket is a Sentinel. He's been a Sentinel for five years--five, long fucking years, in isolation, atop the Wall in Alaska. By all accounts, he shouldn't be sane. But he is--mostly--and when Stacker Pentecost comes to collect him, he makes an offer Raleigh can't refuse.The chance to fight again...and to find his Guide.The two Guides who train him drag him from existing to living; one even becomes his co-pilot. But they are not his Guide. It's not until much later on that he realizes his Guide has been glaring at him almost the entire time.

    Summary
      Obito knows bone deep that he will never quite be the same again after living captive under the influence of Uchiha Madara, can feel the change under his skin were green things writhe. Kakashi's differences extend past his new found sense of humor, live in the complete disregard for others opinions. The change in Rin is subtler, something brewing under her quiet composure that he can't quite see the shape of yet.

    Summary
      She spins to press her shoulders to his and grins, as bloodthirsty as she wants.“Two trips in one year? I must really be special, huh?” He teases, and she’s surprised to find he hasn’t changed at all from her last visit.“I’ve figured out how to do it on purpose,” She admits, fully expecting the distraction to cost him. It doesn’t. He jerks his head to look at her, but even that is planned in the split second it takes him; a fist goes sailing over his head by the scantest of margins.He doesn’t look concerned at all.His confidence is thrilling.
