The witches are waking | Instagram————-Here is my promised (short) review of one of the books already: Witch by Lisa Lister.The only way to read this book is to skip the first 105 pages and go straight to the ‘practical’ part which was quite interesting for me as someone who didn’t know anything about the topic. It talks about setting up altars, writing spells, the meaning of colors and how to connect to the flow of nature. The first 100 pages are just feminist ramblings, repeated use of the word pussy-power and not-so-hidden promotion of Lister’s other book. It just said nothing useful. I also heard of people more experienced in this stuff that its very exclusive (guys can’t be witches, trans people can’t be witches) and is more like propaganda. So in that case, even though the second half is a bit more interesting, I’m sure there’s way better and more interesting books on the practical part of moder witchcraft if you’re interested in this stuff. I, for one, I’m looking forward to reading the book in the first picture!

Look what came in the mail for me! Do you have any recommendations for a baby witch?
Edit: I’ve been notified that Witch by Lisa Lister is transphobic and Basic Witches is poorly written and the authors don’t actually believe in magick. I apologize for including these two books in this haul. I don’t intend on reading them and will be sending them back. If you have any OTHER books to recommend, I’d greatly appreciate it!

Women are beautiful, powerful and absolutely magical. We grow new life in our wombs. How freaking cool is that? We’re cyclic and therefore a direct reflection of Mother Nature. We are soft. Sensitive. Intelligent. Mystic. We have healing powers. Our love can change the world. We’re are unbreakable. And we deserve to feel how magical and powerful we are every single day. We deserve to let go of all these stories that have been pushed down our throats that we’re weak, worthless, moody, dramatic, that we have to please men. We don’t have to do shit. We’re damn miracles. We’re pure magic and we start remembering our naturally given power.

2“Know that you’re an ancestress of what is to come. Bring the witch back into life and into conversation. Come together in support of each other and not in competition.” /Lisa Lister/ WITCH - Unleashed. Untamed. Unapologetic. A powerful, bold read. It will slap you across the cheeks - with love though - and you’ll kinda like it. It’s not a witch 101 book - you can find a jillion of those. This book will wake you up, it’ll anger you, give you passion and validation - by reassuring you that you don’t need to be validated by anybody. Fucking strong!

it truly disgusts me that the book Witch: unleashed, untamed, unapologetic written by Lisa Lister received so much backlash and was straight up boycotted because she decided to write a book about witchcraft for women, about our own biology and menstrual cycles, and she even said in the introduction that she knew it would make TRA mad, but she wanted to create this book for women. Like she was condemned to be “a terf” and “a cunt” and “ a new age bitch” by the exact same people who think that “gender witchcraft”, anime tarot cards and “like reblog recasts” are a thing. But a witchcraft depending on women’s biology is too far fetched and newage? dont make me fucking laugh. Witchcraft is a women’s field only. Capitalism has truly destroyed not only feminism at this point with the way it promotes skincare &amp; diets &amp; makeup has a way to be able to become “strong feminist women” but also Witchcraft, which women were literally (and still are is some parts of the world) murdered for. Give me a fucking break.
