Maybe - Freeform Luther is Vanya's dad in this btw vanya five and harold are the only ones who are kids the rest are all adults the fiveya (and other ships) aren't till later chapters btw
    Summary
      Vanya absolutely hated their new house. She just wanted to stay at their home back in New York. She'd only lost her mom a few months ago, and dad wants all this change.
This new house has two possible ghosts, some weird kid that won't leave her alone, another kid who keeps randomly showing up, and worst of all, her dad wants to marry her 'life coach'.
What the hell did she do that pissed off the universe so bad?

    Summary
      "I was bullied a lot as a kid as you know, and I have proof of my war, scars… I know my way around things… I decided to use my suffering as impulse. Same as you Leonard… But your dad is in jail. You see him there and feel as if justice was made. I don't get that because my aggressors were too young to actually be held accountable even by their parents. I chose to be a cop so I could keep these types of kids grown into adults at bay…" Vanya took a deep breath. "remember the Miller Case?""Yeah… The poor girl that was ripped apart for the drugs in her stomach when she couldn't puke then out?""Yes. Her. Well… They finally found a match for the six stray DNA's on scene.""Who are they?""Demons from my past."

    Summary
      When Klaus's siblings decided they needed to "help him get better", they didn't realize how far they were going. Not until Klaus had a breakdown one night, and disappeared the next.You'd think they'd learn from their mistakes.They didn'tThey decided Vanya needed to get stronger a few years later. Say what you want about Klaus, but Klaus was capable of holding on through hell and high water. Vanya couldn't. They found out the morning after Vanya committed suicide.Finally, the Hargreeves figured out what they did wrong. Finally, they realized that unless they bonded and got their shit together, they'd lose a third sibling.On one of their family bonding outings, they all decided to go to a concert. It was from a really popular band, Graveyard Shift.They weren't sure how to react when they saw their missing brother and their dead sister on stage.Singing songs that were almost certainly directed at them.

    Summary
      For Klaus Hargreeves there was nothing more terrifying than sobriety. Overdosing? He’d done it in his sleep. Literally. Death? Been there done that. He could fight God and her little bike any day. But sobriety sent shivers down his spine.--In which Klaus uses his powers during Season Two, Allison finds her voice, and Diego spends a bit more time at the Commission

    Summary
      Vanya often receives letters stashed in odd places for her to read. She doesn’t know who put them there, but she is beginning to suspect that her brothers have got something to do with it, considering Allison seems to be oblivious about the entire thing. Without Vanya’s knowledge, the boys of the Umbrella Academy have made a pact to make certain that Vanya isn’t left out of their odd family. They just want to make her feel special instead of being the 'ordinary' one like their father wants them to believe.(drabble series)
