    VIENNA, 1 June 2018 – One year after the illegal detention of Stanislav Aseev, a blogger and contributor to the Ukrainian Service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media Harlem Désir today reiterated his urgent call for the journalist’s release. 
“The continued illegal detention of Stanislav Aseev is abhorrent and cannot be tolerated,” Désir said. “The journalist has already been held captive for one whole year, and the lack of access to the journalist only heightens concerns about his fate. I call for his immediate release for humanitarian reasons and as a matter of principle.”
Aseev was detained by the so-called “DPR” forces at the beginning of June 2017 in Donetsk. Representative Désir raised the case in a public statement one year ago and continues to raise attention to his case ever since including at the occasion of his visits to Ukraine and to Russia. 
“I call on all OSCE participating States to increase pressure on any relevant actors in Donetsk. All stakeholders with influence in this case should aid in Stanislav Assev’s release.”
The OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media observes media developments in all 57 OSCE participating States. He provides early warning on violations of freedom of expression and media freedom and promotes full compliance with OSCE media freedom commitments.
