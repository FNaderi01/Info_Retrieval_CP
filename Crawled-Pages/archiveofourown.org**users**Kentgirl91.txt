    Summary
      His life changed one January night when he went out to a bar like usual. The bar was crowded, filled with sweaty bodies all either drunk or high, dancing like idiots without a care in the world. This was the place where he felt most alive. Where the ghosts couldn’t reach him and he was free to be whoever the hell he wanted to.There, he met a girl like him. They ended up tangled in some random motel room, lost in passion and drunken attraction. It was good, until it all came crashing down on his head a month later in November, when she blew into his room, a furious look on her face that made him sit up. “I’m fucking pregnant.” She snarled, and okay well that wasn’t what he was expecting at all. ...My friend said Klaus had a kid in the comics and I thought why the heck not you know?

    Summary
      Klaus couldn't breathe. The pain was mind-numbing. At least last time he'd had someone he wanted by his side.Ben sat below him, face scrunched. "Klaus?"He didn't answer, the color fading from his face."Klaus!" Ben was up on his feet. "Allison, Diego, someone, do something! He's dying!" Ben tried to slap his sister who froze, confused, a hand at her cheek."Shut up Ben," Klaus slid from his chair, again, eyes rolling up into his head.

    Summary
      He always thought the ghosts wouldn’t be a problem if he couldn’t see.Well, maybe not completely. But, Klaus always thought that his powers would be easier to handle if it wasn’t for his basic senses. If he couldn’t see the ghastly figures, then they wouldn’t bother him as much, right?He never thought that he would actually get a chance to prove or disprove his thoughts.
