    Summary
      She’d seen mountains, deserts, snowy valleys. Rivers and oceans, and lakes so large they might as well be oceans. The wide-open plains, with herds of bison roaming freely, skies that carried on forever.But, sure as the sun rises in the east, civilization had started to push further and further west. Railroads were being constructed, their lines encroaching into the wilds. Telegraph wires started to line the horizon, growing so thick in some cities that it felt like they could block out the sun.A small mountain town had seemed like a good bet.

    Summary
      I think the part 2 of The Last Of Us is not that good. Here’s my take on it. Due to a major attack from an organized group of hunters, supplies are lost and Ellie goes out with others to look for more supplies. Unfortunately for her things don’t go according to plan and she gets separated. Now she runs errands for Isaac in an attempt to show she’s worth having around and so she can bargain with him. Her service in return supplies and transport. But she’s not alone. With Abby’s help maybe, just maybe she can pull it off.P.S I am still learning the site.

    Summary
      It had been twenty years since the world had gone to shit. Twenty years since the infection had started. 
The world was overrun by people who had turned into flesh-eating beasts. The infection, called Cordyceps, caused people to begin mutating, becoming….monsters. Those who weren’t immediately eaten flocked to quarantine zones, government run zones. 
Link was a smuggler, and his latest job has left him escorting a woman a few years younger than him. 
This fic requires no knowledge of The Last of Us. There is some divergence from TLOU canon to make things fit better, but overall, its mostly a character insert because I wanted to know how Link and Zelda would react in this world :)

    Summary
      Many things have changed in the past twenty-five years for Joel, one being the fact that infected now roam the earth. What he didn't think was going to change was his inevitability of him dying someday, some would even say that he seeks out his own death. Nonetheless Joel doesn't understand why or how he is still alive, doesn't know why he has been dreaming of six other strange assortment of people, some traveling together and the other two off on their own. He doesn't know how he is alive after taking that beating from Abby, he doesn't understand what has happened to him but he does know that he will get his revenge. -An AU where Joel doesn't die (or he does but comes back because the old guard) and ends up finding a new family while searching for his revenge along side Ellie.TLOU fans you don't have to really know what the old guard is to understand this, I try to explain most stuff either within the fic or in my authors notes. I do recommend watching the movie though because it's amazing and so well done.
