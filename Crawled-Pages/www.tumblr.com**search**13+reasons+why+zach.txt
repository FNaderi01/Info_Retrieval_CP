            Dating Zach Dempsey would include...        • Lots of basketball games, where’d you’d be on the side lines holding up a cheesy sign saying “# 7 on the field # 1 in my heart.”  • Him looking and winking just as he is about to make the game winning point!  • He’d run to you after a game through the crowd, just to get his winning kiss. 
“y/n!” 
“Oh no Zach! Get your sweaty self away from me.” You said running through the stands. But he catches you in less than a minute and envelopes you in his arm. 
“Caught you.” He whispers 
“You’re an idiot.” You say with a smile
“Yes, but I’m your idiot, so it’s okay.” He says right before he kisses you. 
 • Ice cream dates, he’d smile and watch you as you ate your ice cream. 
“What’re you doing?” You said with a giggle, “You’re so weird.” 
He rolled his eyes, “is it bad that I love my girlfriend so much I can’t help but stare at her beauty?” 
You held out your spoon. “Oh shush and let me eat my ice cream in peace.” He leaned over and ate it as you gasped! “Zachary! How dare you?!” 
He chucked and winked. “Maybe next time you’ll take my compliment, so I don’t have to take you ice cream.”  
•Movies at the Crestmont, where you two would sit in the back and cuddle into him.
•cuddling non stop. 
•lots and lots of kisses, on your forehead, nose, lips 
• You always wear his letterman jacket and it’s huge on you because your boy is a giant. 
“You’re tiny.” “I AM NOT.” “Y/n you are so small.” “I am average height, you fricking giant.” “Gosh you’re feisty, and you look so cute in that.” “Can I keep it.?” “No.” “But Zach…” 
•he’d surprise you from behind and always make an effort to walk you to your classes. 
“Zach you’re gonna be late for your class.” 
“But I have to walk with you to class..”
“I’m a big girl I can walk by myself.” 
“Yes, I’d rather spend time with my girl, than be in class, unless that class is Bio.” 
•you and his sister are best friends, and you guys are always whispering. And he loves how good you are with her. 
•his mom loving you because unlike the rest of his friends, you’re such a good influence on him. She sees the way you two love each other and can’t wait to call you her daughter-in-law
•Zach gets jealous easily, especially when you laugh at Jeff’s jokes and hang out with him. He will give you the silent treatment until you make him realize he’s the only boy for you.
“Zach, I love you. No one else” 
“But Jeff..” 
“He’s a friend, one of my very good friends and you need to stop being jealous about small things. You know i’d never leave you.” 
“I-I’m sorry.” 
You kissed his forehead. “I love you okay? Don’t forget that.” 
•you play video games with him, and sometimes he lets you win, just to see you smile and jump around. 
“OH MY GOD. I BEAT YOU.” 
Zach chuckled, “yes you did.”
“I BEAT ZACH DEMPSEY AT COD.. HOW IN THE WORLD.” 
He scoops you up in his arms, “yes you did y/n, and I’ve got a prize for you.” He says as he kisses you! 
•he’s super protective, especially after hearing Bryce’s tapes, and makes sure you’re never alone with him. 
•He comes to you whenever he is sad, or upset about life. And the two of you cuddle and eat lots and lots of ice cream. 
•You always make fun of how he’s allergic to strawberries. 
“It’s kinda sad, you know? You’ll never be able to bite into a juicy strawberry.” 
He rolled his eyes “yes y/n I’m so sorry that the small little fruit could possibly cause me to die.” 
“I’m just saying it’s a shame, they’re so good.” 
“God, you’re so mean.” 
•He loves PDA when he’s drunk, but when he’s sober, he’d rather it be more personal, just between the two of you. 
•He’s never fails to make you laugh, and cracks jokes just to see your eyes light up and to see your smile grow. 
•When he gets drunk, all he’s does is think about you and tell you how much he loves you, and will not stop kissing you. 
“My girlfriend y/n, she’s such a babe. Like damn she’s the hottest girl in the school and she’s all mine. And have I told you I love her so much.” 
“Zach I’m right here.” 
“You’re really pretty you know that.” 
“Oh dear Zach, how much did you drink.” 
• He’s always super embarrassed after hearing what he did while drunk, and you think he’s the absolute cutest. 
• Zach is so fit, and loves the gym, and half the time you joke you’re dating him just for his abs. 
“God you’re hot.” 
He looked up at you. “Well that was random.” 
“Like I’m definitely dating you for your abs.” 
“Wow y/n so superficial” 
“Kidding I love every little thing about you.” 
“Oh sweet little y/n, nothing about me is little.” 
“ZACH!” 
•Zach leaves the weirdest compliments in your compliment bag, and you keep them all to look at whenever you need to smile. 
•Justin being like another brother to you and always jokes about how you have Zach wrapped around your finger. 
•Justin and Zach are so close you always joke that he’s Zach’s boyfriend. 
“Hi I’m y/n and this is my boyfriend Zach and his boyfriend Justin.” 
• He always tells you the cheesiest science jokes, because he’s a bio nerd. 
“Hey y/n, are you DNA helicase cause I’d like to unzip your genes.” 
“You’re an idiot” 
•Zach dreaming about spending the rest of his life with you and growing old, because you’re everything and more he’d ever imagine in a girl.
