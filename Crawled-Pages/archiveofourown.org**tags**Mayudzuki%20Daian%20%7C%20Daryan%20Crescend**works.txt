    Summary
      Kristoph Gavin's prison psychiatrist has seen just about everything. When the disgraced lawyer becomes one of his clients, however, he starts seeing his workplace, his life, and his place in the world a whole lot differently as Gavin's influence on events and other people widens. Big warnings here for mentions of institutional abuse, and, well, all the terrible prison tropes including violence, verbal abuse, indifference, and generalised bastardry.

    Summary
      This story delves into the mystery of where the HELL Maya Fey and Miles Edgeworth were when Phoenix Wright's world collapsed around him post disbarment and WHY they weren't at his side during Phoenix's darkest hour for those long seven years. Join Phoenix, Maya, Miles, Franziska and the rest of your favourite Ace Attorney characters for nearly a decade and experience with them both their laughter and tears, as they discover life's bittersweet truths: sometimes love isn't enough to mean happily ever after, all the money in the world can't necessarily fix all tragedies, justice doesn't always prevail, and broken hearts heal...but can they ever truly mend? Follows the Ace Attorney Timeline for the most part and goes through AJ to Post DD. Slight spoilers for all games. This is the final installment of the Turnabout Lawful Love Trilogy and takes place right where Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman ended. The story starts pre-Apollo Justice, right before Phoenix's disbarment. Official part 3 of the Turnabout Lawful Love Trilogy.

    Summary
      Senior year is here, and all is well. Or at least, it's going to be, once Clay and Ema enact their brilliant and clearly scientific plan to help Daryan get over that crush he definitely has on Klavier. Daryan does not have a crush on Klavier, and he'd really appreciate it if those two would shut up.

    Summary
  "I don't care what they think of me," he said aloud to himself, listening to the grit in his voice. So rough, deep but not in his usual sultry way, and so devoid of any sort of conviction. But it was the truth, wasn't it? He couldn't find it in him to care anymore. Nothing seemed interesting, nothing mattered in the end; life was in black and white and he wasn't sure when the color had faded.
Klavier Gavin is not a happy man. Years of abuse of exhaustion have caught up to him, and he's no longer able to hold himself together.Despite his attempts to distance himself, the people in his life work to build him back up again.

    Summary
      At just fifteen years old, Apollo already has a lot to worry about - school, friends, family, and being one of the lead performers in the third generation of Troupe Gramarye. But when a certain up-and-coming band’s lead singer starts hanging around, all Apollo’s grandfather can see is a business opportunity. To boost the troupe’s diminishing popularity and secure their place in the spotlight, he wants to manufacture the perfect celebrity couple. Apollo can’t stand Klavier, but...he can’t stop thinking about him, either. Their relationship, both on- and off-stage, is about to get complicated.
