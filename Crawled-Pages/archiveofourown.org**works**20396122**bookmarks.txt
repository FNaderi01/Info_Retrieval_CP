    Summary
      Soulmates? Itâ€™s better not mention you have a soulmate mark, unless you want to be ridiculed by the world. Hiding was your only option. But really, all Min Yoongi wanted to do was shout his love for Jung Hoseok from the rooftops - who cares about the rules? To be honest it was fun at first. It was their little secret, sharing soft smiles and stolen kisses. But as time went on, it became harder. Idolâ€™s werenâ€™t supposed to be in relationships in the first place â€” what would happen if the world found out about them?orSnapshots of Hoseok and Yoongi's relationship over the years they spent together.
