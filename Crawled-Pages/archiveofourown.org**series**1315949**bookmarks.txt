    Bookmark Notes:
      “Remember my old theory about our powers?”Nathan rolled his eyes. “Yeah, yeah, that it’s some kind of manifestation of our ego or whatever --”“Super-ego, not the ego. The super-ego is like our inner critic, remember, that tries to make us act in socially acceptable --”“Right, right, whatever. Anyway, the fact that you’re invisible is because of your terminably crippling shyness and Alisha’s power was because she was afraid of real intimacy and Curtis, well, he wanted to turn back time and fix all of his mistakes, and Kelly was self-conscious about what people thought about her --”“And you’re immortal because you don’t want to be hurt anymore.”
