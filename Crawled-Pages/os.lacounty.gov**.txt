    It is a great honor to represent the vast and wonderfully diverse First District, which stretches from downtown L.A. all the way to Pomona and from Eagle Rock to South Gate. Since I returned to LA County in 2014 to serve my home district, I have worked to improve the region’s quality of life through job development, environmental justice, and access to healthcare. I encourage you to get involved with the many services and resources we provide here in LA County and to stay engaged in the democratic process. Take time to visit my website, follow me on social media, and sign up for my newsletter.
    Supervisor Hilda L. Solis
     I am deeply honored to serve on the Board of Supervisors, and my hope is that my website will serve as a resource for constituents seeking County services, background on important policy issues, and information about the Second District and important upcoming community events. I have always believed that constituents who are informed and knowledgeable about the decision-making processes and workings of government are best positioned to empower themselves, their families, their neighborhoods and their communities. Together, we can work to improve our quality of life and I look forward to working on your behalf.
