I don‚Äôt to get to take really sweet pictures like that for a lot of covers. So, I just get generic pictures taken at Wal-Mart and get them developed there. I don‚Äôt look so hot. It must be nice to get them like his. He probably did about 100 pushups and ate a little turtle soup before that photo shoot. That‚Äôs pretty cool for him to be on the cover. I am kind of jealous about it. I‚Äôd be on the cover of Men‚Äôs Fast Food ‚Äì with no shirt on.‚Äù - Colby Armstrong ‚ÄúHe denies it was airbrushed. He said they taught him how to flex while the pictures were being taken. He must have done something ‚Äì maybe some bench pressing just to make his pecs look big. He‚Äôs a big kid, but he must have been flexing a little. They did a good job with the lighting and stuff like that. I still say his skin looks very, very clear for the front of the magazine.‚Äù -Ryan Whitney [x]:3ccolby armstrongryan whitneyaboutsidney crosbypittsburgh penguinsSource:eternityinalakewirwerdensiegenTuesday, August 11, 2020 with 310 noteswirwerdensiegenZZJ says Xiyao rights.we stanzhu zanjinaboutjin guangyaolan xichenxiyaothe untamedSource:wirwerdensiegenectoplasm-jamesTuesday, August 11, 2020 with 106 notesectoplasm-jamesoh show, you think you‚Äôre so clever :(wei wuxianaboutlan wangjithe untamedSource:ectoplasm-jamesjustkeeptrekkinFriday, August 07, 2020 with 181 notesjustkeeptrekkinüò≠‚ô•Ô∏è ZZJ...and there you have itzhu zanjinaboutjin guangyaothe untamedSource:justkeeptrekkinvvujiMonday, July 27, 2020 with 1,568 notesvvujiwhy‚Äôd he say it so happilyomgwang zhuochengaboutjiang chengthe untamedSource:vvujithejingshiSaturday, July 25, 2020 with 1,766 notesthejingshiI‚Äôm just worried that Young Master Jin will embarrass Xian¬†because of his character.helendamnationxThe creativity in dodging the censors astounds me.
