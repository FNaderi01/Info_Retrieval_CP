Ecumenism Awareness: The Calendar Controversy
      The Orthodox Church is internally divided over 
        the issue of the Church calendar. A minority of Orthodox churches worldwide, 
	beginning in 1923, decided to follow the so-called "New" (Gregorian) Calendar.  
        This is the same calendar used by the Roman Catholics and Protestants, except 
        for the period of Great Lent and Pascha (known as the Paschalion). Most Orthodox 
	churches still adhere to the traditional Church (Julian) calendar. 
      The Church calendar lags the "New" Calendar by thirteen days. The controversy does not, 
        however, constitute a mere quibbling over time, as Dr. Constantine Cavarnos 
        points out in the conclusion of his article "The New Papal Calendar and Its Fruits":
        It should be added 
          that the New Calendar was introduced into the Orthodox Church not for 
          the sake of astronomical correctness, but as the first step in achieving 
          a forced, false union of the Orthodox Church with non-Orthodox New Calendarist 
          Christian bodies [i.e., Roman Catholic, Protestant, etc.], for the sake 
          of certain secular advantages which such a union was expected to have. 
          This was to be the beginning of the Orthodox Church's participation 
          in the 'Ecumenical Movement'a movement which has further divided 
          the Orthodox Church into mutually hostile parties: the Ecumenists and 
          the anti-Ecumenists. All the Greek Old Calendarists are anti-Ecumenists, 
          while some of the New Calendarists are Ecumenists and others are anti-Ecumenists. 
          Thus, the evil fruits of the introduction of the New Calendar, which 
          the Blessed Elder [Philotheos Zervakos] clearly foresaw, keep growing 
          in number.
Showing both calendars on this site's home page is merely an acknowledgement that both calendars do, unfortunately, exist 
in the Church today. It should in no way be seen as a tacit endorsement of the "New" Calendar. Many Orthodox Christians who 
are in New Calendar parishes lament the fact that there are two calendars. Pious Orthodox Christians who understand the effect 
this change has had on the Church long for the return of the New Calendar churches to the traditional calendar. In the meantime, 
this sitewhich has a diverse readership from Orthodox churches all over the worldwill continue to provide, as a 
courtesy, the Saints and readings of the day according to both calendars.

        of some Orthodox (e.g., Archbishop Peter L'Huillier of the OCA) for attacking 
        this element of our Traditional Paschal calculation. This new proposal

        A Scientific Examination of the Orthodox 
        Church Calendar, by Hieromonk Cassian. Published by the Center 
        for Traditionalist Orthodox Studies. This brilliant book not only 
        eloquently lays to rest the spurious claims of modernists that the "New" 
        Calendar is more accurate, but also strengthens the faith of the pious 
        True Orthodox who have resisted the Calendar 
        change by demonstrating how wonderfully the findings of science comport 
        with Holy Tradition.
      "That whoever does not follow the customs of the Church as the Seven Holy Ecumenical 
        Councils decreed, and Holy Pascha, and the Menologion with which they 
        did well in making it a law that we should follow it, and wishes to follow 
        the newly-invented Paschalion and the New Menologion of the atheist astronomers 
        of the Pope, and opposes all those things and wishes to overthrow and 
        destroy the dogmas and customs of the Church which have been handed down 
        by our fathers, let him suffer anathema and be put out of the Church of 
        Christ and out of the Congregation of the Faithful."
       From the Sigillon 
        of 1583
