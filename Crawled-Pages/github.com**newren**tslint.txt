TSLint
TSLint is an extensible static analysis tool that checks TypeScript code for readability, maintainability, and functionality errors. It is widely supported across modern editors &amp; build systems and can be customized with your own lint rules, configurations, and formatters.
TSLint supports:
an extensive set of core rules
custom lint rules
custom formatters (failure reporters)
inline disabling and enabling of rules with comment flags in source code
configuration presets (tslint:latest, tslint-react, etc.) and plugin composition
automatic fixing of formatting &amp; style violations
integration with MSBuild, Grunt, Gulp, Atom, Eclipse, Emacs, Sublime, Vim, Visual Studio 2015, Visual Studio 2017, Visual Studio code, WebStorm and more
Installation &amp; Usage
Please refer to the full installation &amp; usage documentation on the TSLint website. There, you'll find information about

Development
Prerequisites:
node v7+
yarn v1.0+
Quick Start
git clone git@github.com:palantir/tslint.git --config core.autocrlf=input --config core.eol=lf
yarn
yarn compile
yarn test
Creating a new release
Bump the version number in package.json and src/linter.ts
Add release notes in CHANGELOG.md
Use ./scripts/generate-changelog.js (after building it with tsc -p scripts) to generate the changelog diff. This script expects a Github.com personal access token to exist at ~/github_token.txt with "repo" permissions.
Commit with message Prepare release &lt;version&gt;
Push your branch to GitHub and make a PR
Once your PR is merged, wait for the tests to pass on CircleCI for develop
Create a "Release" on GitHub with the proper tag version and notes from the changelog.
The tag should be identical to the version in package.json
Run yarn run publish:local
