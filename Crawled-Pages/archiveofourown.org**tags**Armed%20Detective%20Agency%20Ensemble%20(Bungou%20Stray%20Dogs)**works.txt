    Summary
      [Dazai Osamu x Reader]: 
A total of three coincidences lead you to suicide enthusiast, Dazai Osamu — 1. You also have a mild interest in the pursuit of the afterlife, 2. You work alongside Lucy at the cafe on the first floor, and 3. You may have killed people in the past.
* 
Waking up on 'that' day, you can't remember a single thing except for your name and a mysterious note that tells you to find someone you have no interest in finding. But, as luck would have it, your fate was left in the hands of synchronicity, which took you exactly where you needed to go; despite the aching numbness in your heart that wished otherwise. Oh, and you meet Dazai in the process, who goes on to make everything a lot harder for an amnesiac like you to stay grappled to reality.

    Summary
      Paris has became a place that is full of chaos and nobody really puts much thought to it, except three people. When more and more places are turning into madness, Atsushi needs to convince the ADA that the Paris case /needs/ to be analyzed and dealt with before it will come to Yokohama as well.Because, as Dazai once said to him, the most dangerous attacks are not necessarily the strongest ones, but the ones you didn't prepare for, until it was too late.

    Summary
      Dazai had been four when he accepted that he had been sort of reborn again. He didn’t really want to call it reincarnation since that would mean he would be a complete different person which he wasn’t. Dazai even had the same name again. Yet he had been born with the memories of a 22 years old him that was gifted. At first he had contemplated if maybe these memories were some sort of future vision but then he realized that in this reality gifted humans didn’t exist. A part of him wondered if that was the books fault... even so he was going to use these memories to collect the Armed Dedective Agency to solve the mystery. Though was he really the only one that knew about the alternative reality...

    Summary
      Con il segreto che nasconde, Yokohama è una città dove non si possono dormire sogni tranquilli. Dal Preludio:Una mano di Dazai gli strinse il braccio, mentre le dita dell’altra si aggrapparono alla sua camicia sgualcita sul petto. Il nemico barcollò, ma si rimise in piedi, recuperando una delle proprie pistole.«Chuuya...» ridacchiò Dazai, fuori luogo. «Di nuovo: ho mai sbagliato nel formulare un piano?»«Smettila!» e la prima nota di supplica si mischiò alla richiesta. «Non sei lucido!»

    Summary
      "Kill the king and I'll protect you." he'd said and Chuuya knew that hadn't been a lie. It hadn't been a lie, but the Demon hadn't fully believed it would come to the point when he'd have to hold his end of the bargain either. He expected him to fail. 
"How much are you prepared to sacrifice for freedom?" he'd asked, and Chuuya knew that what he was actually asking was; are you prepared to die for it? And yes, yes he was.
So that had been that.
