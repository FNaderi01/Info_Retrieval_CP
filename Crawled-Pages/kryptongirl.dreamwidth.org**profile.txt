                Krypto Geezy ❀I'm 26 and I'm a lover of comics, video games, books, football (the real kind!) and movies.  I love Star Wars, Star Trek,, historical non-fiction, MMOs, Monkey Island, Batman, Superman, Harry Potter, and Mass Effect.  The list of things I love is constantly evolving and expanding but these are my forever loves.  I love LJ friends and adding you sounds awesome.Please only contact me for personal matters via PM or on AIM as EddieMurphySingz.  You can also follow me on Twitter.  I am a moderator of wow_ladies but do not wish to be contacted about moderation issues privately.  Please contact us via e-mail or use Page-A-Mod.Lurkers creep me out, but otherwise being my LJ friend is really laid back.I am the very model of a scientist Salarian. ❀I've studied species Turian, Asari, and Batarian.I'm quite good at genetics (a subset of biology),Because I am an expert (which I know is a tautology).My xenoscience studies range from urban to agrarian,I am the very model of a scientist Sa-lar-i-aaaaaan.profilecssfriends bannerwow ladies
