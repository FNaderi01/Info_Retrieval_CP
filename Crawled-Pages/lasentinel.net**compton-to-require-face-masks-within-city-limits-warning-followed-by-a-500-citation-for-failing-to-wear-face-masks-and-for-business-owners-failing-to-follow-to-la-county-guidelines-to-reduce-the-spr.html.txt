Compton to Require Face Masks within City Limits; Warning Followed by a $500 Citation            
				By Sentinel News Service                
	                	                Published August 12, 2020
Compton, CA – August 12, 2020 – In the continuous effort to keep Compton residents as safe and healthy as possible from the COVID-19 virus, the City issued an Emergency Service Order for Administrative Citations imposing fines to anyone within City limits failing to wear a face mask and business owners failing to comply with Los Angeles County shutdown orders and restrictions in accordance with the City’s local COVID-19 emergency order.
“As the COVID-19 cases in Compton continue to grow exponentially, we are issuing this order to ensure residents and visitors comply with coronavirus restrictions that can help save lives and reduce the spread,” said Craig Cornwell, Compton City Manager. “We urge everyone to wear a mask when stepping outside their home, not just to protect themselves, but to help keep others around them safe from this virus that continues to hurt families and our local economy. We also ask businesses to continue practicing safe measures to protect their staff and customers.”
The Emergency Service Order will apply to everyone within city limits not wearing a face covering outside their home, and it will also apply to businesses that are not following protocols and restrictions. In accordance with the Compton municipal code, the first violation citation will be a written warning, the second violation citation will be in the amount of $500, the third violation $750, and the fourth violation $1,000. The City will partner with Compton Station deputies of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department for enforcement.
Based on LA County face covering guidelines, please refer to the following:
Face coverings can be bandanas, neck gaiter, homemade face covering, scarf, or tightly women fabric.
Everyone is asked to wear a face covering when they are interacting with others who are not members of their household in public and private spaces.
Wearing a cloth face covering does not eliminate the need to physically distance yourself from others and to wash your hands frequently.
Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, or otherwise unable to remove the mask or cloth face covering without assistance should not wear one. Those instructed not to wear a cloth face covering by a medical provider are also exempt from wearing one.
You are asked to wear a cloth face covering over your nose and mouth when you must be in public and there are others nearby. If you are in a solitary area you do not need to wear a face covering.
