The Hierophant.Do not be afraid to speak. Know that those with nothing to say are often the ones who love to talk the most. Do not let them twist your words. Do not be ruled by the beliefs of others. Do not allow yourself be blindfolded. Perception is within the eye of the beholder. Do not let your thoughts to be dominated by things that are beyond your control.

            Quick and Easy ‚ÄúGood Vibes‚Äú Visualization        There are moments I know I need to light a candle for someone, but I‚Äôm on the rush from work, there are places I need to be, or I just don‚Äôt have the materials on hand. Breathe in, breathe out. There are ways around this. I shut my eyes, breathe in and out to settle my heart rate for a few beats, and put my two pointer fingers together. Pushing energy into my fingers generates a neutral ‚Äúwhite light‚Äù between them, which making a quick and easy discharge of spiritual energy to send well-wishes towards the people in my life who need it most. If you‚Äôre unsure of how to visualize it, think of an electric arc between two wires! Once you‚Äôre comfortable with the visualization, it comes easily to you. It‚Äôs quick, takes no prep, and lets you set your energy aside for the people in your life who needs it most. This obviously is not the most effective way to do this, but on the go, in a rush, or unable to light a candle, this is my go to for creating a quiet moment to focus on their health and wellbeing. Blessings!

You all need to stop assuming that all pagan and magical spaces online are safe. I think folks should stop posting long personal stories asking for advice on pagan forums, groups, and that sort of thing. Even Facebook groups. Especially Facebook groups, actually.Don‚Äôt get me wrong. When I see these posts, nine times out of ten I want to help. I usually even try to help to the best of my ability. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúcringe‚Äù to post that kind of thing, or that it annoys me.I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs not always safe, and you can save yourself a lot of trouble by just taking the same story to close friends privately and asking for advice, or seeing a therapist. I realize not everyone has a good support network, but I do think posting about your problems in extreme detail online may well make those problems much, much worse.It‚Äôs never good to bottle things up. I realize that. But talking to strangers who may be hostile can compound an existing situation very quickly. Often, you could end up wishing you‚Äôd just kept silent about it.I‚Äôve seen it happen over and over. A girl on an empath group on Facebook posted a brief comment asking about how to cut ties with someone she has feelings for. She wanted to do this because she was married, and didn‚Äôt want to continue having feelings and betraying her partner. This ended with a member of the group in question immediately going to the original poster‚Äôs profile and messaging everyone they could to ‚Äúwarn‚Äù them that the girl was ‚Äúhaving an affair,‚Äù even though nothing in the post suggested that. I‚Äôm not sure what happened after that, but I hope it wasn‚Äôt too terrible for the girl.Another person posted in another group that she was recovering from an abortion and wanted to know if there were any remedies to help her recover from what was a painful experience for her. This ended with an anti-abortion witch hunting down her employer‚Äôs information and telling her boss that she‚Äôd had an abortion. Luckily, in that case, the person‚Äôs employer just ignored the messages, but it could have gone very differently. Realize that not all witches or pagans are benevolent. People will hurt others for spite, due to their petty hang ups, and just for no reason at all. If you dump a bunch of your personal information and problems online, you‚Äôre taking a big risk. I‚Äôm not blaming anyone for posting that kind of thing, not saying they deserve it for making those kinds of posts. I‚Äôm only cautioning that it can be dangerous to post like that. I wish people would be more careful.  When these situations develop, I do my best online to be a positive influence, but all it really takes is a few bad apples.You‚Äôll find many groups, servers, forums, sites, whatever that seems to be full of cheerful, kind pagans, but there‚Äôs almost always a few snakes in the grass. Those snakes make all the difference, often in just a few short hours.Please note again that I‚Äôm not saying these posts are annoying, ‚Äúcringe,‚Äù or anything like that. I just worry about people who post them because it‚Äôs a huge risk they‚Äôve taken. Often, the risk is unnecessary. I understand, of course, that folks will sometimes post about being in dire straits and link to a PayPal account or something. I‚Äôm 100% cool with that and have, in the past, helped boost or donate to that kind of thing.Posts asking for financial help usually doesn‚Äôt end badly, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs quite the same as completely spilling your guts about a sensitive situation. In that case, though, I still recommend people be careful.And, another note? When you see these posts (the kind where people really spill their guts) realize that you de facto don‚Äôt know the entire situation. Any action you take will reflect your preconceptions much more than it will reflect the situation. If someone‚Äôs asking for, say a cord-cutting spell, by all means, supply it. If someone needs help hexing their abuser, go for it. But don‚Äôt go digging and get unduly involved. Kind words go a long way. Still, the situation is not yours to ‚Äúfix‚Äù beyond offering advice. If someone posts that, for example, their spouse is beating their child, yes, by all means contact CPS, and encourage the poster to do so as well. Similarly, teach people new spells to help themselves too, like a cord-cutting ritual to get rid of unwanted attraction. But don‚Äôt insert yourself smack-dab into the middle when you‚Äôre definitely not aware of the whole story or who you might put at risk.Part of the reason it‚Äôs risky to post these things rests in the fact that onlookers don‚Äôt know the whole situation. You might end up making yourself look really bad, even if you‚Äôve not done anything wrong.People will jump to the most convenient conclusion that reinforces their own beliefs. Or, someone might be having a bad day and just looking for a target. I‚Äôm not necessarily talking about a curse or hex target, but that can, of course, happen too.Stay safe! Seek support, but don‚Äôt take unnecessary risks!

I‚Äôm not sure if anyone will see this but if you do, I could really use some healing energy and light.I got the strength to leave a toxic five year relationship and I‚Äôm depleted. I‚Äôm lost. I‚Äôm tired and unmotivated. I have lost my faith in love. I am so exhausted. I feel like I lost myself in that time. If anyone sees this, I‚Äôd appreciate any light and healing energy you can send my way.Normally I have things like this under control but this one took me down deep and isolation from the pandemic is making it even harder.Thank you and blessed be to all.

I‚Äôve a question, mostly for witchblr, but I‚Äôd also love if other people chimed in, too.Why do people assign such cultural significance to the death of the gorilla at the Cincinnati Zoo back in May of 2016? I mean Harambe, of course. I know the story well enough. A little boy fell into his enclosure, and they killed the gorilla to stop him attacking the little boy, right? Well, I know there was a huge meme frenzy about it at the time. But why are people still mentioning it four years later? More importantly, why do so many people imply his death somehow started a chain reaction that caused *gestures around* all this? I mean, one of my friends was joking about how the hurricane map from earlier in the week looked like a gorilla, and she said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Harambe. He started it and now he‚Äôs back to finish things!‚Äù I don‚Äôt really get it but it‚Äôs really interesting why so much cultural weight has been put on this poor doomed primate. Perhaps because deep down, we all know we‚Äôre the same poor doomed primates?I also saw a meme last spring where it showed the whole domino falling image, with Harambe as the first domino, then the end was everyone quarantined on 4/20 staying home smoking weed. I don‚Äôt quite comprehend all this. Is it simply absurdism for its own sake, or is there a deeper meaning?I asked my husband and he went on a tangent about popular mythology and lore, and how an event can imprint in the collective unconscious, buuut none of that really went anywhere and I just kind of want to know people‚Äôs thoughts?I think gorillas are majestic, wonderful creatures, for what it‚Äôs worth‚Ä¶
