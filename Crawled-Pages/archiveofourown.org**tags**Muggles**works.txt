    Summary
      When he was fourteen, Harry swore on Sirius’s deathbed that he’d watch out for his best friends, Hermione and Ron. Swore it to his dying godfather, plus to the memory of his deceased mother and father, that he’d watch out for them. And, for many years, Harry did just that. When misplaced trust leads to Hermione returning home with bruises and tattered clothes, Harry vowed revenge on Lucius Malfoy of Slytherin.It was just convenient that he had a son Harry's age.

    Summary
      Draco twisted it between his fingers... back and forth. The metal wasn’t particularly unique in appearance, it was actually rather plain. Yet, the piece had been discovered in the corpse of Hogwarts. Amongst the ruins of his former house, in the dungeons. It bore his family crest. Curious. No jewels adorning it, one of the many faceless minions brought it to him hoping for favor. Everyone recognized the Malfoy crest, feared it. He glanced briefly at the crumpled mass bleeding out on his floor, smirking. Favor indeed. He would need to refer to his father, ask what he knew. How had it been buried there? Who’s had it been? He sensed power pulsing. Curious. His mind wandered back to the blood and smoke of that final battle, the day the Dark Lord rose and conquered... the day hope died. The day many good men, women, and child soldiers fell... that Harry Potter was frozen within Amber... when Granger vanished. Most believed she was dead, but years later, Draco somehow knew she was alive and kicking somewhere. He’d keep orders current for her capture, to be brought directly to him. She’d be alone now... he almost pitied the survivors. His own guilt ate at him enough. The silver almost felt warm.

    Summary
      In the five years since the war ended, Harry Potter's played the golden boy's role well. So well, in fact, he's convinced that living in the public eye is what he wants. That is until Draco Malfoy waltzes back into his life. Or: what happens when a game of tit-for-tat goes a tad too far for our boys.
  Excerpt:
  “You like to please,” Draco murmured. 
  "I guess," he said quietly. To be honest, he wasn't really sure what he'd liked. He'd never trusted anyone enough to experiment, and he'd never, ever, wanted someone the way he wanted Draco. Like his blood was on fire, like his skin was electrified by a simple touch.

      "If my calculations are correct, I am 87.3257% sure that Bokuto is the one taking it up the ass.""You think there's a spell to give a dude a uterus?  I think that'd be hilarious to cast on one of these bastards.""I'd slay a dragon for you.  I'd slay a dragon regardless though, so...""At this rate I'm gonna die a virgin, which is depressing considering how hot my boyfriend is.""If Ushijima-san stared at you any harder you'd blast up in flames.""Get off my wand, you're sitting right on it!  Is it up your ass or something?  I said get off!""If Kageyama's IQ was at least the same number as his age maybe he'd be able to pass a class.""Read a book once in a while. .... Manga doesn't count!""If there was a potion to make you a girl maybe your boyfriend would actually fuck you.""Asahi, I know you're a Hufflepuff, but you can't just let people kick you like that all the time.""Shit, I just lost my textbook.  Guess I can't go to class anymore."        A/N - Part 2 of some more chaotic Haikyuu boys at Hogwarts ^^ Lets go!!!

    Summary
      When Severus decided to leave, he thought there would be no other options. But there were so many. The Wizarding World would hold it's the same views and order, but muggles were ever changing. Evolved, a word that called to him.
So many experiments and so many discoveries.

    Summary
      The last time Auguste Nicolay saw his best friend Vega Lang, was at the latter's grandfather's funeral, when Auguste and Vega were nine years old. A few months later, a serial spree of arson destroyed many of the most ancient pureblood families in China, Vega's family being the first.At the beginning of Auguste's fifth year at Hogwarts, Vega and eight other Beauxbatons students spontaneously appear in the middle of the Great Hall, amidst blood, smoke, and ritual fire. Who attacked the french school? What political turmoil and new dark wizards and witches are making movements in France, in Europe, possibly globally?More importantly--to Auguste's mind, at least--where has Vega been these last six years? Does the genocide in China have anything to do with the attack on Beauxbatons?  *working title, may change at any time

    Summary
      Unapologetically queer, post-war story about queer identity, activism, etc. with a slow-burn Astoria/Ginny romance at its centre. All main protagonists are queer and/or trans. There's queer history, good Slytherins, and close, inter-house friendships. Currently updating at least once a week. Live edits/beta reading on Twitch (twitch.tv/thraenthraen) if you want a peek inside the writing process (and spoilers). Usually Mondays starting at 12noon Pacific (19:00 UTC).
