        README
        I no longer maintain easygit.  Please go look at github.com/dfabulich/easygit.
I pushed this version here because apparently when gitorious died, my
online copy of commits I had made in v1.8.5 went missing and others didn't
have them.  I haven't done maintenance work on easygit for over 4 years now.
