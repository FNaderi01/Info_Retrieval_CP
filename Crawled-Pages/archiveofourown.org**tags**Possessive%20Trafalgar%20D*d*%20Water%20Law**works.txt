Fake Bonney/Zoro Law likes to put his jolly roger on everything like everything like Zoro Tattoos Zoro gets tattoos instead of scars Sabaody Archipelago Tenryuubito | Celestial Dragons | World Nobles Canon Rewrite Giving Zoro a sad backstory Jealous Law like guys I cannot stress how possessive Law is with his crew especially his swordsman HIS swordsman
    Summary
      Trafalgar Law is just a bit of jerk who never thought he'd live past thirteen and somehow ends up alive and pirate captain without quite knowing why.Roronoa Zoro is just a lost kid the Heart Pirates pull out of the North Sea who's only skills are attracting trouble and being able to talk with a goddamn katana clenched between his teeth. And when they're together they become an unstoppable force of nature.

      “torao, torao, torao.” luffy chanted, joy overcoming his entire body, unable to speak more than torao’s name. “torao’s here and with me.” law could feel how luffy’s heart was beating fastly, and he was sure luffy could feel his heart doing the same.
law pulled the younger boy on his lap, luffy burrowing himself tighter into the warmth. “i’m here, luffy-ya. lu-ya, baby, i’m here.” law grasped at luffy’s red vest, fingers feeling to believe that luffy came back to him.

    Summary
      -Kid had been stopping by your boss's shop for a couple of weeks.-He'd thought of [y/n] as some soft overly timid and skittish short stack and in his own words "a fuckin' pitiful".-Or so he thought...
This story maybe get a bit angsty but it will get better... I think? It won't have a bad ending I know that much!!This is a KidxReader so I'm marking mature for language and maybe dark themes, You have been warned.
I do not own One Piece or any of the characters. The only thing I own is the plot, my art(which I will credit) and OC's.The cover was drawn by SaltyAlyx(aka me).

    Summary
      This is the story of two souls, who meet one evening with a tiny chance of falling in love."Okay, why did you call me naïve?" I blurted out. "Because you spoke out loud your dream of simple life" he smirked. "So what's wrong with it?" I asked. "Nothing, it's just life is not simple nor peaceful. Things happen and that peace flies out of the window" he relaxes back on the bench.

    Summary
      It’s in the small gestures that I discovered love; the cheerful waving hand from the parking space, the curling of the lips into a small smile, catching those lovely deep eyes off guard, the light brushing of fingers while collecting coffee cups. It was the small little things that made me fall in love. But the realization of love came in emptiness. AU. Fluff. LawLu.

    Summary
      Robin is usually the first one to know what's going on. Luffy has one of the biggest crushes on Law that he even acts out of character when he's around or talking about him. Law sucks at reciprocating emotions and just wants to experiment with other people beside the rubber boy. and wow I suck at summaries but the story is more than that and will be waaay better (Ooh and longer.)
