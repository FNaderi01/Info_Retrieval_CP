		Merge?[edit]
Hello team, I'm the person who originally made both Template:Tridentine Latin Mass and Template:CatholicMass some years ago. I'm not sure why at the time I thought there should be two separate templates, but it's quite bulky and the two overlap a whole lot. Would anyone object to deleting this template entirely, and then in Template:CatholicMass we can put an asterisk or pilcrow next to anything that's only applicable to the pre-1969 rites, with a footnote reading something like: "*No longer typically used in the Mass of Paul VI"? Let me hear your thoughts. -- LightSpectra (talk) 19:18, 3 April 2020 (UTC)
