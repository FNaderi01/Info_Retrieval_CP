                            carbs, or carbohydrates, are stuff like potatos/chips, rice, pasta, cereal, bread, grain. they dont have much nutritional value on their own, they break down into sugar when theyre eaten (so people eat them to get energy boosts)

                        An incomplete list of tropes that make me go absolutely feral
                        jackthebard:- The fact that some characters, hero or villain, have performed specific actions so often that when someone mentions that action, the character has to say¬†‚Äúcan you be more specific.‚Äù- Large, boisterous, incredibly friendly Russians- The dope slap. Just smacking someone upside the head as a way of telling someone that they were being an idiot- When the morally ambiguous character leaves just before the final throwdown only to painfully admit that yes, they do care about their friends, then turn around and go back to help save the day- Parents that are so obviously and healthily in love with each other that it has the high potential to embarrass their children- When the authorities have the various members of the crew in an interrogation room and it cuts between the different interrogations to the crew either giving wildly different accounts of the same story or finishing each other‚Äôs sentences/answering each other‚Äôs questions- When a character has every right to be frustrated at something physical and appears to be walking away calmly only to lose their cool a second later and grab a sledgehammer or smth- Incredibly grandiose/unlikely threats. IE: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to play hopscotch in your chest cavity‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to carve your heart out with a spoon.‚Äù Bonus points if the character that makes them follows through or makes a reference to them later on.- Someone naming their weapon. Bonus points for naming it after a loved one or a lost love.- The relationship between a pure force of unmitigated chaos and the one¬†person that can (sometimes) keep them under control.- Brick jokes. Like someone drops a line in Season 2, episode 3, only to have it referenced in Season 7, episode 9. The longer the brick is in the air, the better.- Weaknesses that are really lame- When a character has something that happens to them that removes all sense of a filter, and they start saying what‚Äôs *really* on their mind.- Ambiguously worded questions. No matter how you answer, it‚Äôs going to lead to more humor.- Communication errors for the sake of comedy, just like, in general- Slipping innuendos into kids‚Äô movies or shows- The whole master/loyal assistant dynamic. Bonus points if there‚Äôs mutual pining or a secret relationship going on behind the scenes
