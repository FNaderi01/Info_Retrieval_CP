              Do Not Track
            Do Not Track (or just DNT) is a privacy preference you can set in most browsers.
We support Do Not Track because we think it’s really important that you have a simple way to control how your info gets used. That’s why in addition to giving you a number of ways to choose how Pinterest uses your data, we honor DNT as a signal for how you want us to use data we collect outside of Pinterest. 
For all the details, including how to turn on Do Not Track, visit allaboutdnt.com.
