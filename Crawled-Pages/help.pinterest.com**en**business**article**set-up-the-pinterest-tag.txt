            The Pinterest tag tracks the actions people take on your website after they view your ads. Install the Pinterest tag on your site to get audience insights, create audiences and measure your return on ad spend (ROAS).
When you add the Pinterest tag to your website, you can learn which ads lead to more conversions and how people engage with your website. If you use the Pinterest tag, you need to disclose your use of conversion tracking on your website, as described in our Advertising guidelines.
            Choose how to install the tag
If you decide to install the Pinterest tag, you have three options:
Install the Pinterest tag yourself. You'll need to get into your website's HTML to place the base code and event code.
Use a tag manager or platform integration (you may already be working with one):
Google tag manager
Tealium
Shopify
Squarespace
BigCommerce
Magento (Apptrian)
WooCommerce
Ecwid
Have a developer install the Pinterest tag for you. If you provide your developer’s email address, we'll send them instructions to set up the tag for you.
To get started, see how to Install the base code.
            Archive the Pinterest tag
If you have more than one, you can archive an inactive tag. You can restore it later if you decide to use it again.
Log into your Pinterest business account
Click Ads, then click Conversions
Click the ellipsis icon on the right of your screen, next to the tag you want to remove
Select Archive tag, then click Archive again to confirm
            Restore the Pinterest tag
You can restore a tag you've archived if you decide to use it again.
Log into your Pinterest business account
Click Ads, then click Conversions
Click the ellipsis icon on the right of your screen, next to the archived tag you want to restore
Select Restore tag, then click Restore again to confirm
