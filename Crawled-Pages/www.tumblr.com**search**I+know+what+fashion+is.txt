Justin Becomes the Monster He Fears So MuchJustin, Travis and Griffin McElroya very good bit from MBMBAM episode 220Transcript:Justin: Beach tee shirts relax me now!Griffin: We‚Äôre-Justin: I don‚Äôt know what it is, I-Griffin: We‚Äôre killing fashion, one shirt at a time. Take that.Justin: I will, I - so, so sue me! It‚Äôs October in West Virginia, I‚Äôd like to live on island time for a day.Griffin: You‚Ä¶Justin: Cut me some slack.Griffin: I have Spotify, open right now on my computer. Do you want me to blast you? [holding back laughter] Do you want me to put you on blast? ‚ÄòCause I‚Äôve got your history right here in the sidebar:[Growing increasingly angry]‚ÄúTake It Back‚Äù by Jimmy Buffett,‚ÄúNautical Wheelers‚Äù by Jimmy Buffett,‚ÄúJolly Mon Sing‚Äù by Jimmy Buffett,[Justin holding back laughter as Griffin continues]‚ÄúSteamer‚Äù by Jimmy Buffett!‚ÄúTreat Her Like a Lady‚Äù by Jimmy Buffett!‚ÄúManana‚Äù by Jimmy Buffett!‚ÄúWhen Salome Plays the Drum‚Äù by James Buffett, ‚ÄúHavana Daydreaming‚Äù [sic] by Jimmy Buffett.

3I want you to have insurance, in case everything goes pear-shaped.I‚Äôm not going to kill anyone, Crowley. Besides, I like pears.Be serious, Azira.I am. And the answer is no.Azira‚Äôs relationship with his coworkers is‚Ä¶ complicated. Many demons find his nice manners and overt friendliness off-putting. They‚Äôre far too paranoid to trust a lick of it, so they assume he‚Äôs up to no good and stay out of his way.¬†Of course, there are some who don‚Äôt understand his manner of temptation and earthly indulgence, who think him soft and slow and undemonic. And if they were to catch on that he had performed a blessing or two, well‚Ä¶ their lot don‚Äôt send rude notes.

3YOI Future!Verse ABO AU - Clothing Set#01 - Yasha Katsuki-NikiforovI think sometimes you can learn a lot about a person from their clothing choices, and I‚Äôve always sorta wanted to make some fashion sets ^ ^ So I‚Äôm making one for the OC kids, starting with the eldest as usual, Yasha! (He‚Äôs probably pre-teen-ish around here, maybe, idk)Yasha still more or less thinks of himself as a boy (when he can be bothered to think about it at all) but loves flowers, pastels, and anything soft and gentle (in harsh contrast to his blunt as a bludgeon personality). And most importantly, he kinda just really hates wearing pants and underwear, when he can get away with full nudity‚Ä¶ He takes the young!Victor flower fairy aesthetic to the next level. He can be very picky about what he wears, and usually prefers expensive but relatively unknown specialty brands. His parents, especially Victor, are more than happy to indulge his tastes.~~IF YOU ARE NEW TO THIS AU: It‚Äôs a Yuri!!! on Ice AU, Yuuri-centric with end-game polyamory in an ABO 
setting, Yuuri gets married to four mates (Victor, Yurio, Phichit, Minami) 
and they have OC kids.This post features the Victor x Yuuri kid, Yasha.BASICS and timeline of this AUINTRO to how ABO works in this AUA SUPER DETAILED world-building headcanons post on ABO+ in this AUOTHER POSTS (comics + illustrations) in the Future!Verse ABO section of my YOI Masterpost.~~Please keep ship bashing out of the comments/tags. Don‚Äôt like, just skip &lt;3 Thank you.~~PLEASE DO NOT REPOST, EDIT, TRANSLATE, OR OTHERWISE USE MY ART. More detailed rules available on my Rules &amp; FAQ Post.

Boys can wear dresses and flowers tooHe just wants to look prettier okayHe already knows he's pretty he's not lacking in confidence thank you very much LOLand yeah i see that lil bit of hair on his shoulder in the Casual version I'm too lazy to fix it orz1,273 notesLoading...Show more notesReblog
