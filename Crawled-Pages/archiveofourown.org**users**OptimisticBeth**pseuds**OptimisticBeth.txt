Powerful. Mysterious. He’s admired and envied, feared and loathed, depending on who’s talking, but for all everyone knows his story, no one seems to really know him. And Rey… Rey has been curious about him for… well, for longer than she wants to admit.She’s not sure if it’s good or bad luck that he’s the perfect person to help cast her spell.

        Librarian stories make me super happy, but I especially love the way this story talks about books and relates it all back to character development so smoothly.

    Summary
      Her gland pulses faintly, nudging into the soft leather strap fastened about her throat, throbbing in time with her heartbeat as she lies in the unfamiliar bed trying to prepare herself for him. Someone she’ll never properly speak with or see in the light. A man whose name she’ll never know.
Silence pours through Rey’s pricked ears, and she readjusts her head on the pillow, listening for any trace of movement.
Is he even in the room? Has there been some mistake?
She’s almost ready to roll over and check her phone for any last-minute messages she might’ve missed when the whispering of fabric makes her freeze.
He’s here. As motionless as she’s been. 
Waiting.
  Omega Rey needs money to make her tuition payment. One night with a faceless Alpha and his twisted tastes promises to change that.

      Bookmarker's Notes
        I love the balance of Good Guy Ben and Alpha Instincts/Rape Fantasy Ben. He's likable while still giving the story that dangerous edge.It's interesting that the first chapter is a carefully arranged BDSM scene, whereas the second is more spur-of-the-moment impulse. It gives a nod to how things ought to be done without making the story a manual on how to do this stuff the "right" way.Be aware that, if you prefer careful attention to consent in your reading material, you'll hate this. It's not for you. Move along.
