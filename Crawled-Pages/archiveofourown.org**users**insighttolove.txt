    Summary
  "Singletail whip. Your favorite, isn't it?"Red. Stiles felt nauseated as he bent over the bench. Red. The tremble only increased when his wrists and ankles were secured with leather straps. Red. He heard the Dom behind him give a sample crack of the whip in the air. Red. This would likely pierce his skin. So fucking Red."What's your safeword?"Red."Stiles?""The.. the stoplights, Sir."
Stiles's first introduction to the world of BDSM was a complete fiasco. You see, he had a crush on this ridiculously hot Dom and might have slightly exaggerated (ahem, lied blatantly) a few things on his questionnaire. Five years later the two meet again under a different set of circumstances.

    Summary
      It may be in the middle of a zombie fucking apocalypse, and the world may be ending... but Stiles Stilinski is just too stubborn to lay down and take it.He's got a few states left to cross, with his ass now sitting comfy near the eastern state line of Nebraska. Roscoe is holding on as best she can without a mechanic and with Stiles siphoning what little gas he manages to find. Twinkies and coke will fuel him when he can't find anything else to garble down.He's coming back home, dammit. End of the world be damned.---Or, Stiles is trying to get back to Beacon Hills from where he was at college in New York, fighting back against zombies and survivors who want him dead just the same. He's got nothing more than his guns and bat, his failing wits, and Roscoe. But that should be enough. It has to be.That is, until Stiles makes a fateful stop in Yellowstone and happens upon a wolf that is a lot more than what it initially seems.(includes fan art! please do not repost!)

    Summary
      The wolf’s fur is softer than even Stiles could have imagined, like clouds and baby bunnies, and Stiles cards his fingers through the ruff at the wolf’s neck. The wolf whines and leans into the caress and Stiles can feel his eyes fill. He stands there, crying with the wolf leaning into his legs and his hand fisted in the wolf’s fur.God, what a night. Stiles unlocks the door. “I hope you’re housebroken.”
