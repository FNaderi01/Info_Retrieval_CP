Councilman Jawane Hilton Fights To Bring Covid-19 Testing To Carson            
				By Sentinel News Wire                
	                	                Published April 17, 2020
		Carson, CA. – While the stay at home order is in place the need for testing sites closer to homes and residents is a priority.  That is the very reason that Councilman Jawane Hilton is fighting so desperately to bring a testing facility to the residents of Carson.
“Right now we have over 135 residents who have tested positive for Covid-19 and that is the number we have with no testing facility anywhere near our city.  The closest testing locations to us are Brentwood, there is one in Santa Monica but what about Carson?  What about the South Bay?  We need a drive thru testing facility right here in our city.”  Stated Carson City Councilmember Jawane Hilton.
The councilman has been working with Health and Human Services people at the County of Los Angeles and Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas office to bring a testing facility to Carson.  “Supervisor Ridley-Thomas and his office have been extremely helpful in my pursuit of a testing facility.  I believe we will get one, but we need it now.  We need an adequate supply of testing kits and the man power to operate this facility for the Citizens of Carson and other South Bay Communities” stated Hilton.
The councilman explains that everyone is being asked to shelter in place, but what if you don’t feel well.  What do you do?  Where do you go?  The shear fear that you might have this virus, that your children may be exposed to the virus is brutal and in humane.  We need a facility and we need it now explained the local pastor and long time councilman for the City of Carson.
