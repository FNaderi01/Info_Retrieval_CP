                            EdStat: To Date, 75 Percent of Charter Schools in New Orleans Have Adopted High-Quality Curricula

Research suggests that consistent exposure to high-quality curricula has a significant positive impact on student learning. The Louisiana Department of Education developed a rating system that identifies curricula with the strongest alignment to the state’s academic standards, identified partners that provide high-quality professional learning to teachers, and supported school systems as they purchased these top-notch resources. In an article for Education Next, Robert Pondiscio found that these “advances are unmatched in other states that have adopted Common Core or similar standards.” To date, 75 percent of charter schools in New Orleans have adopted the high-quality curricula. To learn more about Louisiana’s curriculum, check out Kunjan Narechania’s post on the EdNext blog.
