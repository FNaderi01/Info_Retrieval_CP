                 Mini Bio
                Hi, I’m Regan and I’m just your average teenage girl in London finding her way through life. I’m studying A-Levels in English, History, Sociology and Psychology, and I’m hoping to start studying a BA Social Anthropology in September.I’m 17 years old. My date of birth is June 20, and that makes me a Gemini. In Chinese Astrology I’m a TigerI have a pretty complicated family. The basics of it is that I live with my step-mum (Jade Rachel), her wife (Erin) and my little brother (Caden Bryce). I see my dad (Craig) and his boyfriend (Jimmy) all the time. My mum died almost 7 years agoUnlike most of my peers I do not feel comfortable posting my picture online. It creeps me out a little not knowing who could be looking at it or anything.My favourite colour is pinkI’m pansexual but single.I love sport. Especially football. I support Chelsea FC. I also love swimming, karate, gymnastics and cheerleading.I love baking. And cupcakes. And eating them ;)I nearly always have my nose in a book. Sci-fi, fantasy, urban fantasy, historical and chick-lit are my favourites… spot the odd one out!
