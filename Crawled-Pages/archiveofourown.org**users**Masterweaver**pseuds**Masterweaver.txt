    Summary
      "I don't get it," Luz admitted, scratching her head. "Exactly how are geese on the Boiling Isles different from the ones on Earth?"Willow replaced her glasses and glanced from the human to the now practically pink Amity, a slow smirk crawling onto her face. "Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeell--"Amity quickly started pushing the human down the hall. "OH LOOK we'regoingtobelateforclass youdon'twanttogetintotroubleLuz okaylet'sgo itwasniceseeingyouWillow biiiyeeee!"

    No Archive Warnings ApplyRuby Rose (RWBY) Weiss Schnee Blake Belladonna Yang Xiao Long Penny PolendinaRomantic Comedy Matchmakers in a panic Who's going to end up together? Let's keep that a secret
    Summary
      It's obvious to Blake and Yang that Ruby has a crush, and it's just as obvious that she'll be much happier once she actually confesses. So they agree to work together and set up the most romantic evening possible for their teammate and the object of her affections. There's just one minor issue:
Yang thought Ruby wished wistfully for Weiss, while Blake thought Ruby pined privately for Penny.
Now the night of the 'date' has come and the two must scramble to make sure Ruby doesn't realize what's going on, Weiss and Penny don't stumble on each other, and hope that nobody's hearts are broken.
A romantic comedy of errors, parties, fancy restaurants, rivers, and increasingly panicked teenagers.
