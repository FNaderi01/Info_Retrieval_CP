To our Black community members: We hear you. We see you. We will fight with you. For non-Black folx, it is imperative to recognize and call out anti-Blackness in yourselves and your communities. Dismantling white supremacy begins with acknowledging your own implicit biases and choosing to act against the oppressor--  your silence is compliance with the structure of white supremacy.  Listen to Black voices: use your privilege to amplify their messaging without speaking over them. Give your time, your ears, your hands, and your money if you are able. Use your privilege as a shield for those who are unprotected. Remember that Black leaders have been at the forefront of liberation movements for centuries.We tried to curate an extensive list of resources, actionables, links, and literature, but we know that there are still incredible resources out there that are not included in this doc. We will continue to update as we find more, and encourage you to continue amplifying anything you come across with your friends, family, loved ones, followers, communities, and local collectives.www.changingwomxncollective.org | www.instagram.com/changingwomxnNote: We strongly advise you to either copy/paste this information to another Google Doc, log out of your Google accounts and reenter the Doc, or download it as a PDF to decrease your chances of being doxxed, because people can usually see who is on a Doc.
