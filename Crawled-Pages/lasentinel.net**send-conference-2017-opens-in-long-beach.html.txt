Send Conference 2017 Opens in Long Beach            
				By Sentinel News Service                
	                	                Published February 1, 2017
		Pastor Trip Lee of Atlanta, Georgia, will speak at the Send Conference 2017. He is also an author, teacher and hip hop artist.
The Send Conference 2017 hopes to provide encouragement and practical takeaways for every Christian to know why and how to join God’s global mission in their everyday lives.
The event will take place on Friday, Feb. 3, at 10 a.m., and continue on Saturday, Feb. 4, at 8:30 a.m., at the Long Beach Convention Center, 300 E. Ocean Blvd., in Long Beach.
Two days of teaching, worship and opportunities will connect individuals with practical ways to allow God to weave the rhythms of their lives, jobs, schooling and relationships into His global mission.
Presented in partnership by the North American Mission Board and the International Mission Board, Send Conference 2017 SoCal features leaders including Kevin Ezell, North American Mission Board president; IMB President David Platt, Francis Chan, Vance Pitman, D.A. Horton and Trip Lee. Worship will be led by Austin Stone Worship, Rend Collective and Phil Wickham.
“We want to help every believer discover the mission God has for them, to equip them to share the transformational truth of the gospel and to connect them with opportunities to do so,” said Ezell.
“Our Send Conference in Southern California is the first of three gatherings in 2017 that we hope will be powerful catalysts to continue a movement of people from inside the church joining the mission of God in their everyday lives.”
“It is our heart to equip and mobilize limitless missionaries to carry the gospel of Jesus Christ to every neighborhood and every nation,” said Platt. “We will push past the status quo, the inconveniences and the expected to challenge each person to commit to a life fully surrendered to Christ.”
A spokesperson explained that breakout sessions led by pastors, practitioners and leaders in ministry will include church planting, compassion ministry and more will provide resources and ideas for every person to walk away from the conference with tangible next steps for themselves, their churches and their missional communities. Whether it’s high school seniors committing to a college with the intentions to be involved in campus church planting or professionals specifically applying for jobs in influential cities overseas, application will be for the everyday Christian to join the everyday mission of God.
“It’s time we examine our hearts and redefine what everyday mission looks like,” said Dustin Willis, NAMB executive director of marketing and events.
“The message remains the same, but our approach must become more intentionally integrated into the everyday rhythms of our lives. Attendees will explore the ways God can use them where they are and with the talents He’s given them.”
