Who would’ve thought that a monologue, a test, would’ve led to such disaster, such a horror, such a perfectly disastrous masterpiece? Also, can James stop flirting with the director?(Indefinite hiatus, I just feel super uninspired for this story. Slow updates to be expected, and they won't be long either.)
