While governments and international organisations have been planning for a global pandemic for years, planning for the attendant economic shock has been much less studied. This ‘Vox Debate ’ gathers research-based policy analysis and commentary on the economics of COVID-19 from leading economists. The topics will cover all the usual international mechanisms of contagion (trade, capital flows, financial institutions, expectations, etc) as well as the domestic impact such as the size, persistence, and sectoral composition of the economic implements. The topics, however, can range further to include the impact on political economy, populism, income and gender inequality, the environmental impact, precarity of work (gig economy), and more.
