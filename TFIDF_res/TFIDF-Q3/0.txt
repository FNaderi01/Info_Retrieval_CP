EdNext Podcast · Ep. 130 – Sept. 5, 2018: Does Teacher Coaching Work?
			When teachers open their classroom doors and allow trained coaches to observe them and offer feedback, the teachers’ instruction improves.
But can this form of teacher professional development be taken to scale?
Matthew Kraft, an associate professor of education and economics at Brown University, sits down with EdNext editor-in-chief Marty West to discuss his article, “Taking Teacher Coaching To Scale,” co-written with David Blazar.
The EdNext Podcast is available on Apple Podcasts, Google Play, Soundcloud, Stitcher and here every Wednesday.
